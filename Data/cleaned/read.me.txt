"primary_lifestyle" - [avonet]
    Aerial = species spends much of the time in flight, and hunts or forages predominantly on the wing;

    Aquatic = species spends much of the time sitting on water, and obtains  food while afloat or when diving under the water's surface; Generalist = species has no primary lifestyle because it spends time in different lifestyle classes"

"trophic_level" - [avonet]
    Herbivore = species obtaining at least 70% of food resources from plants; 
    Carnivore = species obtaining at least 70% of food resources by consuming live invertebrate or vertebrate animals; 
    Scavenger = species obtaining at least 70% of food resources from carrion or refuse; 
    Omnivore = species obtaining resources from multiple trophic level in roughly equal proportion

"trophic_niche" - [avonet]
    "Frugivore = species obtaining at least 60% of food resources from fruit; 
    Granivore = species obtaining at least 60% of food resources from seeds or nuts; 
    Nectarivore =  species obtaining at least 60% of food resources from nectar; 
    Herbivore = species obtaining at least 60% of food resources from other plant materials in non-aquatic systems, including leaves, buds, whole flowers etc.; 
    Herbivore aquatic = species obtaining at least 60% of food resources from plant materials in aquatic systems, including algae and aquatic plant leaves; 
    Invertivore = species obtaining at least 60% of food resources from invertebrates in terrestrial systems, including insects, worms, arachnids, etc.; 
    Vertivore = species obtaining at least 60% of food resources from vertebrate animals in terrestrial systems, including mammals, birds, reptiles etc.; 
    Aquatic Predator = species obtaining at least 60% of food resources from vertebrate and invertebrate animals in aquatic systems, including fish, crustacea, molluscs, etc; 
    Scavenger = species obtaining at least 60% of food resources from carrion, offal or refuse; Omnivore = Species using multiple niches, within or across trophic levels, in relatively equal proportions "


"migration" - [avonet]
    1 = Sedentary. 
    2 = Partially migratory, i.e. minority of population migrates long distances, or most of population undergoes short-distance migration, nomadic movements, distinct altitudinal migration, etc.
    3 = Migratory, i.e. majority of population undertakes long-distance migration"
    
"range_size" - ""The total area of the mapped range of the species (not the Extent of Occurrence [EOO]). We used maps shared by BirdLife International and restricted our analysis to areas of the range coded as Presence = 1 (Extant only), Origin = 1 & 2 (Native & Reintroduced),
    Seasonal = 1 & 2 (Resident and breeding). We calculated the total combined mapped area of these parts of the range using the areaPolygon function from the R package geosphere (Hijmans et al., 2011). This function accurately calculates the area in the World Geodetic System (WGS84) projection using spherical                distances" [avonet]
