SortID,An internal ID code
Order,"Taxonomic order, according to the Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive taxonomy (BirdLife International) circa 2017"
Family,"Taxonomic family, according to the Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive taxonomy (BirdLife International) circa 2017"
Species common name,"Species English common name, according to the Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive taxonomy (BirdLife International) circa 2017"
Species scientific name,"Taxonomic genus and species, according to the Handbook of the Birds of the World Alive taxonomy (BirdLife International) circa 2017"
PhyloName,The corresponding tree tip name in the Jetz et al. (2012) Global Bird Tree
phylo-duplicate-flag,A flag noting that this phylogeny name corresponds to multiple rows in the dataset (1 = duplicate rows present; 0 = no duplicates present; NA = not assignable to phylogenetic tip)
phylo-fidelity,"A flag noting which species is closer to the phylogeny tip name, for analyses requiring only one entry per tip. Usually the nominate subspecies is flagged (e.g., the tip Pachyptila salvini can be assigned to both P. salvini and P. macgillivrayi; P. salvini is flagged with a 1 and P. macgillivrayi with a 0); otherwise the entry with the fewest NAs is flagged, or chosen arbitrarily."
