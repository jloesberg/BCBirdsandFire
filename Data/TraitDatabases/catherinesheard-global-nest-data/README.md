# global-nest-data

Here you can find the data and metadata for "Nest traits for the worldâ€™s birds" by Sheard et al., along with the code file necessary to run the MCMCglmm models presented in the supplement.

The tree files are too large to be posted to GitHub, but can be obtained from https://birdtree.org/ or by contacting the first author (catherine.sheard@abdn.ac.uk).

We also provide the code necessary to reproduce Figure 4.

Please note that the code for Figure S1 is based on the BirdLife International range maps, which cannot be shared (even in modified form) with third parties. Please see http://datazone.birdlife.org/species/requestdis or contact the first author (catherine.sheard@abdn.ac.uk) for more information.
