For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","The following information refers to the species's habitat use in its European range. In its natural range, this species shows a considerable variation in its habitat. It is found chiefly in the overgrown edges of rivers, hilly areas close to cultivation and flat land which is under cultivation. In Azerbaijan, egg-laying occurs in April and May. The nest is a shallow depression in the ground, which is lined with plant material from the vicinity of the nest, or unlined. Clutches are nine to fourteen eggs. In its natural range, the species feeds on plant matter such as fruits, seeds, leaves, buds and a small amount of animal matter, for example insects. Where it is introduced it is an opportunistic omnivore, feeding on a diverse range of food, preferring large, energy rich items such as cultivated grains, mast and fruits. Mass migrations may occur in its native range but in its introduced range it is sedentary (McGowan et al. 2013).",In its introduced range in Europe it is very common and wild populations are often augmented by large numbers of captive bred birds for shooting. However in Azerbaijan race talischensis has been brought to the brink of extinction due to habitat loss and uncontrolled hunting (McGowan et al. 2013) and there is no reliable information on its current status (Braasch et al. 2011).,"The European population is estimated at 4,140,000-5,370,000 pairs, which equates to 8,290,000-10,700,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Europe forms &lt;5% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 165,800,000-214,000,000 mature individuals although further validation of this estimate is needed.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour Truly wild populations of this species are migratory (particularly where displaced by cold weather) (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) although European and feral populations are essentially sedentary (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) or only locally migratory or nomadic (Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds during the local spring (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a)as isolated pairs in well-defended territories (del Hoyo et al. 1992). After breeding the adults may gather in large concentrations of thousands or more (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988) on selected waters (Madge and Burn 1988) (non-breeders in northern Europe migrating to such gatherings (Snow and Perrins 1998)) between July and August (Scott and Rose 1996) to undergo a flightless moulting period lasting for 6-8 weeks (Kear 2005a). Although not noticeably sociable in many areas during the winter (Johnsgard 1978) the species may flock in groups of several thousands on favoured waters (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996). Habitat The species inhabits a variety of lowland freshwater wetlands (del Hoyo et al. 1992) such as shallow lakes (Kear 2005a), ponds (Madge and Burn 1988), lagoons, marshes (del Hoyo et al. 1992), reedbeds (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) and slow-flowing rivers (Kear 2005a) (showing a preference for clean, weed-filled streams over larger, polluted rivers) (Johnsgard 1978). It is also common on artificial waterbodies such as reservoirs, gravel-pits, ornamental lakes (del Hoyo et al. 1992), ditches (Snow and Perrins 1998) and canals (Scott and Rose 1996), and will graze on grassland and agricultural land (e.g. arable cereal fields) (Kear 2005a). Moulting congregations of adults and non-breeders (Snow and Perrins 1998) may also utilise brackish or saline habitats (Johnsgard 1978) including brackish marshes (Kear 2005a), estuaries and sheltered coastal sites (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (e.g. brackish lagoons (Kear 2005a) and bays (Madge and Burn 1988)). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of leaves and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992) and grasses (del Hoyo et al. 1992) as well as algae (Johnsgard 1978) and grain (del Hoyo et al. 1992), occasionally also taking small amphibians (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992) (frogs, toads and tadpoles) (Snow and Perrins 1998) and aquatic invertebrates (e.g. molluscs, insects and worms) (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is a large mound of aquatic vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a) placed close to or floating on shallow water (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a) or amongst reeds (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding pairs often re-use nesting sites from previous years if the it was successful (Johnsgard 1978). Management information The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK resulted in an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes and in turn led to an increase in the winter use of the habitat by the species (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994). A control of the breeding output of the species (brood reduction) carried out in the Wylye Valley, UK to try to alleviate the species's negative impacts on fisheries (e.g. by overgrazing submergent riverine vegetation) was found to be ineffective as it had an insignificant impact on local population sizes (possibly due to immigration from surrounding areas) (Watola et al. 2003).","The species suffers heavy losses from lead poisoning due to ingested lead fishing weights (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kelly and Kelly 2004), lead shot (Spray and Milne 1988) and lead contaminated sediments from mining and smelting activities (Day et al. 2003). Heavy losses have also been recorded from local incidences of copper poisoning (Kobayashi et al. 1992). The ingestion of or entanglement in fishing lines and/or hooks can also cause severe injury or mortality (Kelly and Kelly 2004) as can collisions with overhead lines (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species may be threatened by future oil spills (which can cause death by oil saturation) (Berglund et al. 1963). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006)(e.g. strain H5N1) (Nagy et al. 2007) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus. Significant mortality can occur with prolonged freezing weather in winter which prevents birds from feeding (Carboneras and Kirwan 2013).","The global population is estimated to number approximately c.598,000-615,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 83,400-116,000 pairs, which equates to 167,000-231,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Increasing,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex II.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is predominantly migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and travels over land making brief stop overs (Snow and Perrins 1998). It breeds from mid-May in solitary pairs with well-defined territories (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (non-breeders remaining in flocks separate from breeding pairs) (Kear 2005a). Adults undergo a post-breeding moult period between late-July and early-August when they become flightless for c.30 days (Kear 2005a) (5-6 weeks) (Scott and Rose 1996), males starting to moult before the females (Kear 2005a). Non-breeding individuals moult at the same time as breeders, but whilst breeding pairs tend to moult in their breeding territories non-breeders moult in large congregations (Kear 2005a). After moulting the species begins to migrate south from late-September to October (the precise timing determined by weather conditions) (Kear 2005a) and arrives on the wintering grounds by October or November (Madge and Burn 1988). The species departs for the breeding grounds again from March to April (Kear 2005a) or early-May (Madge and Burn 1988). Outside of the breeding season the species is highly sociable, migrating in small flocks or family groups (Madge and Burn 1988) and congregating into flocks of up to 300-400 individuals in the winter (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988). The species roosts on areas of open water adjacent to its feeding areas (Madge and Burn 1988). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on islands in or along the banks of shallow freshwater pools, lakes, slow-flowing rivers (del Hoyo et al. 1992), marshes, swamps and bogs (Kear 2005a), showing a preference for habitats with abundant emergent vegetation (Kear 2005a) and reedbeds (Johnsgard 1978) in taiga (coniferous forest) zones (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005a), birch forest zones (Johnsgard 1978) and shrub/forest tundra (Kear 2005a) (generally avoiding open tundra) (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992). Non-breeders may also be found in flocks (Kear 2005a) along sheltered coasts (del Hoyo et al. 1992) on estuaries, lagoons and shallow bays during this season (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding On migration the species frequents lakes, estuaries and sheltered coasts (Kear 2005a). It traditionally winters on freshwater lakes and marshes (Kear 2005a), floodlands (Snow and Perrins 1998), brackish lagoons and coastal bays (Kear 2005a) although low-lying coastal agricultural land (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and wet pastures (Snow and Perrins 1998) are now used increasingly (Kear 2005a). Diet The species is predominantly herbivorous (del Hoyo et al. 1992), its diet consisting of the leaves, stems and roots (Johnsgard 1978) of aquatic plants (e.g. algae and Zostera, Ruppia and Potamogeton spp.), grasses (del Hoyo et al. 1992), sedges and horsetails (Equisetum spp.) (Kear 2005a). During the winter the species also takes agricultural grain, vegetables (e.g. potatoes and turnips (Johnsgard 1978)) and acorns (del Hoyo et al. 1992), and on the breeding grounds young birds often take adult and larval insects (Johnsgard 1978) (e.g. emerging chironomids) (Kear 2005a). Adults may also supplement their diet with marine and freshwater mussels (Kear 2005a). Breeding site The nest is a large mound of plant matter (del Hoyo et al. 1992) built on dry ground or in reedbeds (Johnsgard 1978) on small islands in or along the edges of lakes, pools or rivers (Madge and Burn 1988). The same nest mound may be used over several years although it is often repaired and new material is added (Kear 2005a). Management information A study carried out at a wintering site in Denmark found that large wind turbines (towers 68 m high with blades 66 m in diameter, blades sweeping the heights of 35-101 m) pose less of a collision risk to the species than wind turbines of a medium height (towers 45 m high with blades 48 m in diameter, blades sweeping the heights of 21-69 m) (Larsen and Clausen 2002).","The species is threatened by habitat degradation and loss (such as the reclamation of coastal and inland wetlands) (Kear 2005a) especially in the Asian part of its breeding range (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Threats to its habitats include agricultural expansion (Kear 2005a), wetland drainage for irrigation (Ma and Cai 2002, Kear 2005a), overgrazing by livestock (e.g. sheep) (Ma and Cai 2002, Kear 2005a), vegetation cutting for winter livestock feed (Ma and Cai 2002), the development of roads (Ma and Cai 2002, Kear 2005a), mining (Ma and Cai 2002) (e.g. strip mining of sediment) (Gardarsson 2006), hydroelectric dam construction, disturbance from tourism (Ma and Cai 2002) and chronic oil pollution from oil exploration (Nikolaeva et al. 2006), exploitation (Ma and Cai 2002) and transportation (Nikolaeva et al. 2006). The species may suffer heavy losses from future oil spills (Nikolaeva et al. 2006), flying accidents (Kear 2005a) (such as collisions with overhead lines (Kear 2005a) or wind turbines (Larsen and Clausen 2002)), poisoning (Kear 2005a) from lead shot ingestion (Spray and Milne 1988) and natural disasters such as droughts or heavy snowstorms (Ma and Cai 2002), and is susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is also threatened by hunting (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Ma and Cai 2002, Kear 2005a), nest destruction and by subsistence egg collecting (Gudmundsson 1979, Ma and Cai 2002, Nikolaeva et al. 2006).","The global population is estimated to number &gt; c.180,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1992), travelling on a narrow front (Kear 2005a) between separate breeding and wintering grounds (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It breeds from mid-May to late-June or early-July (Kear 2005a) in territorial pairs (Madge and Burn 1988) which may form loose colonies (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992) of not more than c.10 pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998). After breeding the species undergoes a flightless moulting period in July and August that lasts for c.25 days (Scott and Rose 1996), during which it remains close to open water (such as the sea or early thawing lakes) (Kear 2005a). Icelandic non-breeding flocks migrate to staging areas (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a) in east Greenland to moult, whereas breeding birds from Svalbard, Greenland and Iceland remain near their breeding areas (Scott and Rose 1996). After moulting the species departs from its breeding and staging grounds (Kear 2005a) from August to mid-September (Madge and Burn 1988), most arriving on the wintering grounds in October (Madge and Burn 1988). Outside of the breeding season the species remains highly gregarious (Madge and Burn 1988), generally forming large concentrations in the autumn (commonly up to 5,000 in the UK) (Snow and Perrins 1998) and in winter (Madge and Burn 1988). These aggregations are usually loose however, with large roosting flocks dispersing into smaller foraging groups by day (Snow and Perrins 1998). During the winter the species roosts on water by night and forages in nearly all hours of daylight (Kear 2005a). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on rocky outcrops, crags, steep river gorges (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a), cliffs, riverbanks and snow-free hummocks near areas of lush vegetation (Greenland) (Kear 2005a) in open arctic tundra (del Hoyo et al. 1992), especially near seabird colonies (Kear 2005a). Later in the summer the species forages chiefly on damp sedge-meadows, and while moulting and flightless it remains close to the sea or early-thawing lakes (Kear 2005a). Non-breeding The species overwinters on extensive areas of saltmarsh (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a) in estuaries (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and on flat agricultural land (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (e.g. improved or fertilised grasslands, stubble fields, pastures and newly sown cereal fields) (Kear 2005a). In Scotland favoured winter daytime roosting sites include estuarine mudflats, lochs and reservoirs (Madge and Burn 1988). Diet The species is hebivorous (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and an opportunistic forager (Kear 2005a). Breeding During the breeding season its diet consists of the leaves, stems, roots, berries and seed-heads of sedges, mosses, lichens (del Hoyo et al. 1992), Empetrum spp. and grasses (Kear 2005a). Non-breeding In its wintering areas the species is more reliant on grass, grain, vegetables (e.g. carrots, sugar beet (Kear 2005a)) and potatoes grown on agricultural land (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is a low mound of vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a) on cliffs, rocky outcrops or snow-free hummocks (Kear 2005a) often near seabird colonies (Kear 2005a). The species nests in territorial pairs (Madge and Burn 1988) which may from loose colonies (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992) of not more than c.10 pairs, with neighbouring nests spaced as little as 5 m apart (usually more than 75 m apart) (Snow and Perrins 1998). Management information An investigation carried out in one of the species's wintering areas (UK) found that it was most likely to forage on grasslands a minimum of 6 ha in area, managed by livestock grazing or mechanical cutting, with an optimum sward height of 13-20 cm (although the species was also found to use heavily grazed land down to a sward height to 1.5 cm), at a distance of less than 10 km away from roosting sites (the optimum distance was 2-5 km away) (Vickery and Gill 1999). Fertilising the grassland with nitrogenous fertiliser (ammonium nitrate 34.5 % N) in early-March at a rate of 80 kg N ha1 was also found to double the grazing intensity of geese compared to unfertilised areas (although no further increases were found with higher rates of fertiliser application) (Vickery and Gill 1999). Studies in the Vejlerne nature reserve, Denmark found that wind turbines placed in lines or small clusters cause less disturbance to the species than large clusters (small clusters may be placed in conjunction with existing physical elements such as roads, wind-breaks or buildings, and are therefore less likely to coincide with grasslands areas used for grazing by the species) (Larsen and Madsen 2000).","The species is hunted illegally in the spring in Iceland which may become a threat (Kear 2005a). Disturbance from hunting on spring staging grounds in Norway has major negative impact on breeding success, and persecution (shooting and disturbance) of the species by farmers is likely to increase in the future if populations increase (due to the species's impact on agricultural grassland) (Kear 2005a). Disturbance from farmers discouraging foraging individuals from their land in the winter has been shown to reduce the species's reproductive success in the spring (Madsen 1995), and the species is also threatened by general disturbance (e.g. from helicopters surveying areas for oil exploration) (Mosbech and Glahder 1991). It may be threatened by land-management changes (such as a reduction in the intensity of management and land abandonment) (Tombre et al. 2005), and by future habitat loss such as the development of hydroelectric projects on interior rivers in Iceland (which would flood a major moulting area) (Kear 2005a). The nesting success of breeding pairs in Svalbard is greatly reduced as a result of arctic fox Vulpes lagopus predation (Madsen et al. 1992). Utilisation The species is subject to hunting in Svalbard, Norway and Denmark, although mortality due to hunting does not seem to be a major factor controlling population sizes (O'Connell et al. 2006).","The global population is estimated at c. 410,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 57,000-74,000 pairs, which equates to 114,000-148,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Increasing,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex II. CMS Appendix II. In the Netherlands and the UK and some other areas in Europe, governments compensate farmers in relevant goose areas to support conservation. Recent population increases are most likely due to the protection of sites, changed behaviour (birds using inland roosting sites such as reservoirs), improved food supplies and a reduction of hunting. Although the species is considered legitimate quarry in all European range states, special restrictions are in force throughout, for example in Denmark goose shooting is only permitted in the early morning during a short autumn season and recreational hunting in spring is banned everywhere (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). In 2012 an International Species Management Plan was developed for the Svalbard population (Madsen and Williams 2012).Conservation Actions ProposedThe following proposed actions refer to the species's European range only: Compensation schemes for farmers should be continued and improved. Research in Norway has suggested the current compensation scheme can be made ten times more efficient through strategic prioritization. Careful management in important areas is needed to maintain the current population. In the UK, one study suggested that the manipulation of sward height and fertiliser application provides suitable habitat for this and other species of geese (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014). Hunting should be monitored and sustainable hunting levels ensured where hunting is in practice. Spatial management should be enhanced and maintained (Madsen and Williams 2012).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It arrives on the breeding grounds from April (Kear 2005b) or early-May and breeds from mid-May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Males gather in large flocks close to the breeding grounds after mating to undergo a flightless moulting period (Madge and Burn 1988).

It shows a preference for shallow water (Johnsgard 1978) up to 4 m (Kear 2005b) (maximum 6 m) deep (Snow and Perrins 1998), and requires mature broadleaved trees (e.g. oaks, willows and aspens) with holes in which to nest (Johnsgard 1978). Non-breeding The species overwinters on large freshwater lakes (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and reservoirs (Johnsgard 1978), ice-free rivers (Kear 2005b), brackish coastal lagoons, estuaries (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and sheltered coastal bays (Madge and Burn 1988) (although rarely on the open sea) (del Hoyo et al. 1992), often resting and feeding on small bodies of water or small streams when on passage (Kear 2005b). Diet During the breeding season its diet consists predominantly of benthic aquatic invertebrates such as adult and larval insects (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005b), crustaceans, molluscs and polycheate worms (Kear 2005b), as well as amphibians (del Hoyo et al. 1992), fish (Kear 2005b) and plant matter (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (seeds, leaves and roots) (Kear 2005b). During the winter and in early spring however the species mainly feeds on fish (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The species nests in tree hollows (del Hoyo et al. 1992) up to 10 m or more above the ground (Kear 2005b) (especially those excavated by Black Woodpeckers Dryocopus martius) (Madge and Burn 1988) in mature broadleaved trees (e.g. oak, willow or aspen) (Johnsgard 1978). It may also nest in artificial nest boxes (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005b), especially those erected to attract Common Goldeneye Bucephala clangula (Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998).","Where it occurs in large numbers on coastal waters the species is particularly vulnerable to oil pollution (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Populations declined in Europe throughout the 19th and 20th centuries due to habitat degradation and loss (e.g. the loss of mature trees in river valleys as a result of logging, conversion to agriculture and river canalisation) (Kear 2005b). The species has also suffered local declines as a result of predation by American mink Neovison vison (Kear 2005b), and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Climate change is also affecting the range of this species (Pavón-Jordán et al. 2015). Utilisation The species is susceptible to a certain amount of hunting pressure when on passage and during the winter (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","The global population is estimated to number &gt; c.130,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 9,200-17,600 pairs, which equates to 18,300-35,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour In central and north-west Europe this species is mainly sedentary (del Hoyo et al. 1992) although other populations are chiefly migratory (Madge and Burn 1988). Migratory populations arrive on their breeding grounds from late-April (Kear 2005a) where they breed in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo et al. 1992) with hundreds often nesting at the same site (although not colonially) (Kear 2005a). Once incubation has commenced (Madge and Burn 1988) the males gather in flocks (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a) to moult (moult migrations occurring in some areas) between late-June and early-September when they become flightless for 3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996) (females moult their flight feather 1-2 months later) (Scott and Rose 1996). The autumn migration begins in September (Kear 2005a), with a segregation of the sexes occurring in autumn and winter due to the difference in the timing of the moult (Scott and Rose 1996). The return spring migration begins in late-February (Kear 2005a). During the winter the species is highly gregarious and may occur in flocks of several thousand individuals (Kear 2005a). Habitat Breeding The species breeds in lowland regions and shows a preference for eutrophic waters 3-5 m deep (avoiding lakes deeper than 15 m) (Kear 2005a) with open water, islands for breeding (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and abundant marginal and emergent vegetation (Kear 2005a). It is common on large, freshwater lakes, ponds, reservoirs (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a), gravel-pits (Kear 2005a) and quiet stretches (Kear 2005a) of wide slow-flowing rivers during this season (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a). Non-breeding During the winter the species frequents large freshwater lakes (Kear 2005a), reservoirs (Snow and Perrins 1998) and sheltered coastal locations (Kear 2005a) such as brackish lagoons (del Hoyo et al. 1992), brackish inland seas (Kear 2005a) (e.g. Caspian Sea) (Scott and Rose 1996), tidal bays (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and estuaries (Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998) although it avoids strong wave action and very exposed maritime conditions unless all inland freshwaters become frozen (Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet The species is omnivorous (Kear 2005a) a major part of its diet consisting of molluscs (especially Mytillus and Cardium spp., gastropods (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and zebra mussels Dreissena polymorph (Kear 2005a)), crustaceans and aquatic insects (del Hoyo et al. 1992), as well as grain (Kear 2005a) and the seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic plants (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is constructed of vegetation and is placed in water (Kear 2005a) on floating mats or islets (Flint et al. 1984), or on the ground on islands (del Hoyo et al. 1992) in rush or grass tussocks (Snow and Perrins 1998), under bushes (Kear 2005a) or in the open amidst marsh-nesting gull or tern colonies (for protection against predators) (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a). Nests are usually placed within 20 m of water (Kear 2005a) although on islands they may be placed up to 150 m away (Snow and Perrins 1998). Although the species is not colonial hundreds may nest on the same site with neighbouring nests spaced 7-11 m apart (within gull or tern colonies nests are spaced 2-3 m apart) (Kear 2005a). Management information In the UK (Salford docks, Manchester) the species prefers to feed in waters heavily polluted with sewage that are devoid of aquatic vegetation but hold high densities of oligocheates and other pollution-tolerant organisms (Marsden and Bellamy 2000). The species may therefore suffer from plans to improve water quality in the docks (e.g. modernising sewage treatment systems and oxygenating water) (Marsden and Bellamy 2000). Experimental removal (extermination) of the nest predator American mink Neovison vison in the outer archipelago of south-west Finland also resulted in an increase in the breeding density of this species (Nordstrom et al. 2002). The species competes for food (e.g. chironomid larvae and molluscs) with fish species such as roach Rutilus rutilus (Winfield and Winfield 1994). A study in the Czech Republic found that fish ponds with a fish stock density of less than 400 kg ha1, water transparency of more than 50 cm, mixed fish stocks (e.g. tench and pike or perch) rather than monospecific stocks (e.g. of carp), and systems that include ponds with fish fry (to provide areas with low fish competition and high invertebrate availability) are more successful in supporting breeding pairs of this species (Musil 2006). The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK resulted in an increase in invertebrate food availability and increases in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes, which in turn led to a increase in brood use of the habitat by the species and increased species survival (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994).","The species is threatened by habitat degradation due to oil pollution, drainage, peat-extraction and changing land management practices (Grishanov 2006) (e.g. decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth (Grishanov 2006) and agricultural intensification (Kear 2005a)) in breeding areas (Kear 2005a, Grishanov 2006). It also suffers decreased reproductive success as a result of disturbance from increased recreational use of inland waterbodies (Kear 2005a), machinery noise from urban development (Marsden 2000), hunting (Evans and Day 2002) and predation by American mink Neovison vison on islands (Nordstrom et al. 2002). The species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Utilisation The species is hunted for sport Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006), Italy (Sorrenti et al. 2006) and Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006), and is hunted commercially in Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is highly migratory, breeding widely across Western Eurasia and wintering within the northern tropics (Scott and Rose 1996). It migrates on a broad front, the autumn migration beginning in late July and peaking in August or early September (in Europe and Egypt), with birds beginning to arrive in East and West Africa in early September, peaking in October (Scott and Rose 1996). Once the species reaches Africa it migrates in relation to seasonal flooding, the central point of its occurrence shifting gradually along the course of rivers as the winter progresses (Alerstam 1990). The spring migration begins in February, with birds beginning to arrive on breeding grounds from mid-March to early-May (Scott and Rose 1996). It is a highly sociable and gregarious species (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988), and whilst breeding can be found in single pairs or small groups, but regularly forms large congregations of several hundred on passage, and flocks of up to several thousand are common in African and Asiatic winter quarters (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988). Adults undergo a post-breeding moult period that leaves them flightless for 3-4 weeks, with males moulting between mid-July and mid-August, and females between mid-August and September (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Kear 2005b). The Volga Delta, in particular, is a major moulting area for this species. Birds of this species are both diurnal and nocturnal feeders, and when migrating often travel by night and rest on open water during the day (Johnsgard 1978). Habitat Breeding In the breeding season this species frequents small, shallow ponds and lakes with abundant floating, emergent and fringing vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo. 1992) (that is not too tall or dense, such as bulrush - Typha spp.) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Green 1998), in grass dominated environments, like swampy meadows, flooded fields, shallow freshwater marshes (Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo. 1992, Schricke 2001). Non-breeding During this season the species shows a preference for large freshwater or occasionally brackish lakes, again with abundant floating, emergent and fringing vegetation (Kear 2005b), also shallow flood plains, shallow dams, pans and sewage ponds (in South Africa) (Hockey et al. 2005). The species also frequents coastal saltmarshes and lagoons on passage (de Hoyo. 1992) and may spend the day resting on marine inshore waters when migrating (Madge and Burn 1988). Diet Breeding When breeding this species is omnivorous (Johnsgard 1978). In spring and summer its diet is dominated by animal matter: chiefly molluscs, aquatic insects and their larvae (waterbugs, caddisfly, waterbeetles, midges), crustaceans (ostracods and phyllopods especially), worms, leeches, young and spawn of frogs, and small fish (Johnsgard 1978, Hockey et al. 2005). Seeds, roots, tubers, stems, leaves and buds of plants such as Hornwort Ceratophyllum, Naiad Najas, sedge, grass and other aquatic plants are also important at this time (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo. 1992). Non-breeding During this season the birds are mainly vegetarian, with a diet dominated by the seeds of pondweeds, smartweeds Polygonum, sedges, dock Rumex, wild rice and grass (Kear 2005b), (with the seeds of Echinochloa colona, Nymphea micranthia and Nymphea lotus being the most preferred food items) (Treca 1981). Breeding site Meadows are the favoured nesting areas of this species, with nests rarely located more than 150 m from water (usually within 20 m) (Cramp and Simmons 1977). The nest itself is a depression in the ground, typically situated under rushes or tall grasses (such as manna grass, Glyceria), but not generally under shrubs (Johnsgard 1978, de Hoyo. 1992).","Breeding The most significant threat encountered by this species on its breeding grounds in Europe is habitat deterioration through the drainage and reclamation of wetlands (Kear 2005b), the increasing climatic aridity and subsequent lowering of the water table, and the transformation of wetlands to dammed reservoirs (Scott and Rose 1996). Other threats to this species include the destruction of nests during the early mowing of meadows (Kear 2005b), increased human disturbance (Kear 2005b), lead poisoning, botulism during hot summers (Kear 2005b) and hunting disturbance in Africa and Europe (Vaananen 2001) (&gt; 500,000 are shot annually in Russia, Ukraine, France and Poland) (Kear 2005b). The invasive species American Mink Mustela vison also poses a threat through nest predation (Opermanis et al. 2001), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza (particularly strain H5N1) so is therefore threatened by outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Non-breeding On its wintering grounds in Nigeria and Senegal the species is threatened by habitat destruction through dam construction, vegetation overgrowth and desertification (del Hoyo 1992, Polet 2000, Triplett and Yesou 2000), and in West Africa it is threatened by large-scale river diversion and irrigation schemes (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also at risk from avian influenza in its African wintering grounds (Gaidet et al. 2007) as well as in its breeding areas (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The proportion of the species which migrates via the West Siberian flyway is susceptible to West Nile Virus, and is therefore threatened by future outbreaks (Ternovoi et al. 2004). Utilisation This species is hunted in Denmark , but there is evidence that this may be sustainable (Bregnballe et al. 2006). The species is also hunted for commercial and recreational purposes in Gilan Province, northern Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006).","The global population is estimated to number c.2,600,000-2,800,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 352,000-524,000 pairs, which equates to 704,000-1,050,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II. Conservation Actions ProposedThe following information refers to the species's European range only: Key areas of breeding habitat for this species should be identified and protected.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour The species is strongly migratory in the north of its range (Kear 2005b) although breeding populations in temperate regions are largely sedentary (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Males leave the breeding grounds in early-July (one month before the females and young), migrating to key waters to undergo a flightless moulting period lasting for c.4 weeks, after which they continue to the wintering grounds (Scott and Rose 1996). The return migration occurs from March to April (Scott and Rose 1996), and although the timing of the breeding season varies geographically the species generally nests late in the year (e.g. May-July) (Kear 2005b). It breeds in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and is usually observed in small parties outside of the breeding season, with large concentrations sometimes forming on passage (Madge and Burn 1988) or during the moulting period (Kear 2005b) (Madge and Burn 1988). Habitat The species inhabits highly productive (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005b) and eutrophic (Snow and Perrins 1998) freshwater marsh or lake habitats (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005b) in open lowland grassland (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988), showing a preference for sheltered, shallow, standing or slow-flowing waters (Snow and Perrins 1998) with abundant emergent vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005b) and grass-covered islands providing cover for nesting (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). It may also be found on permanent, shallow, slightly alkaline marshes (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992), as well as on oxbow lakes, channels (Flint et al. 1984), reservoirs and gravel-pits (Kear 2005b). After hatching, females move their broods to deeper marshes or to the edges of large impoundments, sometimes more than 1 mile away from the nesting sites (Johnsgard 1978). Rarely (e.g. in the winter) (Madge and Burn 1988) the species occurs along sheltered coasts (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996) at coastal marshes (North America) (Kear 2005b), estuaries (Flint et al. 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998), deltas or lagoons (Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet The species is predominantly herbivorous (del Hoyo et al. 1992), its diet consisting of the seeds, leaves, roots and stems of aquatic plants (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (submerged and emergent) as well as grasses and stoneworts Chara spp. (Kear 2005b), occasionally also taking cereal grains on land (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998). In addition, the species may take a small amount of animal matter during the winter (Africa), such as insects, molluscs, annelids, amphibians, amphibian spawn and small fish (Brown et al. 1982). Breeding site The nest is a well-hidden (Johnsgard 1978) hollow (Snow and Perrins 1998) in grass and leaves positioned on the ground in thick vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992) such as nettles Urtica spp. (Madge and Burn 1988), grass tussocks, thick bushes, rushes or tall grass (Brown et al. 1982). The species shows a preference for dense, dry herbaceous vegetation (Johnsgard 1978) and often nests far from water (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b). It may nest in dense concentrations on islands (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b) (neighbouring nests as close as 5 m apart) (Snow and Perrins 1998) although it is not a colonial species (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b). Management information The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK (leaving small fish for piscivorous birds) resulted in an increase in the winter use of the habitat by the species as result of an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994).","The species is threatened by pollution (Kear 2005b) and disturbance from recreational use of freshwater wetlands (Kear 2005b, Pease et al. 2005). It also suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (Spain) (Mondain-Monval et al. 2002) and nest predation by American mink Neovison vison (Europe) (Opermanis et al. 2001). The species is susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Utilisation The species is hunted throughout most of its range (Kear 2005b) both for recreation (Bregnballe et al. 2006, Shortridge et al. 2006) and commercial uses (Balmaki and Barati 2006), but is rarely taken in large numbers except where it is particularly abundant (Kear 2005b).

86147127,22692543,Crex crex,Least Concern,,2016,2016-10-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Data from ongoing (albeit modest) monitoring in Russia (which holds the vast majority of the global population) indicate that the predicted declines have not taken place and that numbers have remained stable since 2002 or are even increasing. Whilst it is difficult to accurately predict future trends owing to the species's extensive range and differing climatic and agricultural conditions in different regions, it is thought that populations in key parts of the range in Russia and Kazakhstan are unlikely to change dramatically in the near future. The species is therefore classified as Least Concern because global population declines approaching 30% (predicted in 2004) have not taken place, and there is little evidence to suggest that they will do so in the next 11 years (three generations). This classification has taken place on the basis of improved knowledge of the species's global extinction risk, as opposed to a genuine recovery to favourable conservation status across its range. The species remains a high conservation priority in significant parts of its range (at both national and regional levels), and continued conservation interventions, research and monitoring are essential. Evidence of a downturn in its fortunes or adequately documented projections of imminent rapid declines would warrant a further review of its status.","Behaviour The species is a long-distance migrant (Del Hoyo et al. 1996). It breeds during the months of April-August, with nests generally well separated but sometimes only 20-55 m apart from one another (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It is sequentially polygynous, with some males moving a considerable distance to new singing areas (Green et al. 1997). A male's territory may encompass several nests (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), and local concentrations of breeding birds therefore sometimes occur (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The species normally produces two broods per year. It begins to leave its breeding grounds in August, with a peak in September (Cramp and Simmons 1980), and arrives on its African wintering grounds in November-December (Cramp and Simmons 1980). It migrates at night, travelling at low altitude (Del Hoyo et al. 1996). During migration it sometimes travels in pairs (Cramp and Simmons 1980), occasionally forming groups of around 20-40 individuals (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), and diurnally resting flocks may contain several hundred birds (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It occurs solitarily during the non-breeding season, individual birds holding territories of 4-9 ha (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The return migration begins in late February or March, and the breeding grounds are occupied from mid-April (Cramp and Simmons 1980). Habitat Breeding The species breeds in open or semi-open habitats, mainly meadows with tall grass. The original breeding habitat would almost certainly have been riverine meadows of Carex-Iris-Typhoides and alpine, coastal and fire-created grasslands with few trees or bushes present (Green et al. 1997). The species is now strongly associated with agricultural grassland managed for the production of hay (Barnes 2000). Suitable habitats include moist, unfertilised grassland and regularly cut meadows in areas of low-intensity agriculture where vegetation grows tall in summer. Across its European range, hay or silage fields in valleys liable to flooding seem of most importance, but birds also breed in hay and silage fields in subalpine areas. Wetlands and marsh edges may act as important refuges when drier habitats are unsuitable. Males are also found singing in clear-cuts in forest, pastures and young conifer plantations. Singing males can regularly be heard in fertilised meadows or fields sown with cereals, but successful reproduction here is thought to be infrequent (Schäffer and Mammen 1999). In Bulgaria radio tracking showed that the two broods are produced in different locations, the second brood at a significantly higher altitude than the first one, thus benefiting from delayed vegetation development and later hay mowing at higher altitudes (Niemann 1995). It avoids very marshy areas, standing water, river and lake margins and open ground with rocks, stones and gravel (Del Hoyo et al. 1996), and also those areas with a thick layer of dead grass or very dense vegetation above 50cm tall (Cramp and Simmons 1980). Adults move to areas of high herbage along ditches to moult after breeding (Taylor and van Perlo 1998): embankments or fallow areas adjacent to the breeding habitat are very important as moulting sites (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Non-breeding During migration it occurs in a variety of habitats including wheat fields and on golf courses (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). In the wintering grounds dry grassland and savanna are preferred with birds also occurring in rank grass near rivers, sewage ponds and pools and in relatively short grass in wetter areas, moist sedgebeds and reedbeds and in tall grass within young conifer plantations (Barnes 2000). It also occurs in Eragrostis hayfields, old land and pastures, maize fields bounded by grass, fallow and abandoned cultivation uncut grass on airfields, and the edges of sugarcane (Barnes 2000). It occurs where vegetation is between 30cm and 2m in height, and often in areas that are burnt during the dry season (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Diet It feeds on a wide range of invertebrates, including taxa living on plants, on the soil surface and in the soil (Green et al. 1997). It takes a large number and wide variety of insects (Cramp and Simmons 1980), as well as snails and slugs, arachnids, millipedes, earthworms, young frogs, green parts of plants, young shoots and seeds and possibly even small mammals and birds (Cramp and Simmons 1980). Breeding site The nest is on the ground in dense vegetation and is constructed from dead stems and leaves (Green et al. 1997). Often surrounding stems are pulled over the top to form a loose canopy (Del Hoyo et al. 1996). The average clutch-size is c.10 eggs and two broods may be raised per season (Green et al. 1997).","Chick mortality due to mechanized mowing and consequent increased predation is considered to be the primary threat in Europe (Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006). Intensification of grassland management and the loss of hay meadows and wetlands are considered as the critical threats to its habitats (Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006). Following privatisation, potential changes to land-use and management of agricultural land in the species's core breeding range in Russia and eastern Europe are also possible threats (Schäffer and Mammen 1999). Land abandonment temporarily favours the species, but areas become unsuitable as vegetation becomes too dense and scrub develops. Land abandonment leads to a loss of suitable habitat in 5-10 years (BirdLife International Corncrake Conservation Team 2015). Intensified management of hay meadows, or their conversion to arable, is resulting in widespread habitat loss (Schäffer and Mammen 1999). Across western and central Europe, intensification of grassland management, leading to earlier and rapid mowing of hay and silage, is the main threat (N. Schäffer in litt. 2003). Early mowing and the use of mechanised methods results in the destruction of nests and chicks (Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006). It is a quarry species in Russia, Ukraine and Georgia, but hunting pressure is considered low. Illegal hunting of the species during the Common Quail Coturnix coturnix hunting season has been reported from Bulgaria and Croatia, and 0.5-2.7% of the European population may be susceptible to capture in netting set up for C. coturnix in Egypt each autumn. Introduced mammals, such as domestic cats and the American mink Mustela vison, are reported to be predators of the species's nests, in addition to native species. The species may be disturbed by recreational activities and developments, such as motorways (Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006). Late spring floods can reduce local populations by around 50% (Donaghy 2007).","The European population is estimated at 1,290,000-2,120,000 calling or lekking males, which equates to 2,590,000-4,240,000 mature individuals (including 1-1.5 million pairs in European Russia) (BirdLife International 2015). This is marginally higher than the last European population estimate of 1.3-2 million breeding pairs (BirdLife International 2004) and higher than the 1.1-1.8 million pairs previously estimated by Schäffer and Mammen (1999). A further 515,000-1,240,000 pairs are estimated for Asiatic Russia, yielding a global total of 3,600,000-6,700,000 mature individuals. Given the high level of uncertainty in some of the breeding estimates and the apparent scarcity of the species in its non-breeding areas in sub-Saharan Africa, the total population may fall at the lower end of this range; even in the low millions.",Stable,"This species breeds in Europe and central Asia, as far east as western China, and winters in sub-Saharan Africa. The European population was most recently estimated at 1,290,000-2,120,000 calling males or 2,590,000-4,240,000 mature individuals (including 1-1.5 million pairs in European Russia) (BirdLife International 2015), marginally higher than the previous estimate of 1.3-2 million pairs (BirdLife International 2004), which in turn was higher than the 1.1-1.8 million pairs in Europe previously estimated (Schäffer and Mammen 1999), and significantly higher than the 92,000-233,000 estimated in 1996, the difference resulting from the completion of the first systematic surveys of national populations in eastern Europe and Russia. A further 515,000-1,240,000 pairs are estimated for Asiatic Russia (Schäffer and Mammen 1999), yielding a global total of 3.6-6.7 million pairs or 5.4-10 million individuals. Given the high level of uncertainty in some of the breeding estimates and the apparent scarcity of the species in its non-breeding areas in sub-Saharan Africa, the total population may fall at the lower end of this range; even in the low millions. Whilst some of these populations may be increasing, population trends are unclear and often show large fluctuations (K. Koffijberg in litt. 2007) in response to changes in agricultural practices or annual rainfall (A. Mischenko in litt. 2006). Historically, most west European range states have seen major declines, which continued in some countries during 1990-2000 but were reversed elsewhere (BirdLife International 2004). The population in the UK recently increased, from 480 calling males in 1993 to 1,245 calling males in 2007, in response to conservation action (P. Walton in litt. 2006, K. Koffijberg in litt. 2007), although numbers dipped to 1,098 in 2009 (RSPB 2010) but were estimated at 1,200 calling males in the period 2006-2010 (BirdLife International 2015). Many western European states have observed a partial recovery since 1997, but dominated by large fluctuations (K. Koffijberg in litt. 2007). In Finland the population in 2003-2008 averaged around five times that in the 1990s (T. Lehtiniemi in litt. 2010). Monitoring since 2002 in 13 regions and republics in Russia (which holds the vast majority of the global population) indicates that numbers have remained stable or are even increasing (with some fluctuations due to extreme weather) (A. Mischenko in litt. 2010). Whilst it is difficult to accurately predict future trends owing to the species's extensive range, and differing climatic and agricultural conditions in different regions, it is thought that populations in key parts of the range in Russia and Kazakhstan are unlikely to change dramatically in the near future, although agricultural intensification and abandonment may drive some regional declines, and the species's conservation status in much of the western part of its range remains unfavourable.","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS (Bonn Convention) Appendix II. Bern Convention Appendix II. EU Birds Directive Annex I. The species is legally protected from hunting in most of the countries in its breeding range (Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006). Conservation measures have been taken in 14 European range states. National action plans have been prepared in Switzerland, Norway, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Hungary, Germany, Denmark, UK, and Slovakia. Appropriate habitat management techniques have been researched, and local repeat surveys in Russia show relative stability of the population (A. Mischenko in litt. 2006). A European action plan was published in 1996 and a revised version published in 2006 (Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006), and a Corncrake Conservation Team was established in 1998. There is an ongoing reintroduction programme in England, UK (Newbery (2006). Conservation Actions ProposedMonitoring and research are needed into large-scale population dynamics, including estimating population trends, range shifts and changes in timing of breeding. Estimates of demographic rates and identification of key sites and threats faced by the species on migration are also required. Monitoring schemes should be implemented in range countries where knowledge of population size and trends is currently uncertain and the extent of land abandonment, particularly in Russia, should be monitored (BirdLife International Corncrake Conservation Team 2015). Monitor numbers through regular coordinated surveys, and improve monitoring in key countries (e.g. Russia, Belarus) (Doga Dernegi 2006, Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006). Monitor habitat condition and extent (Doga Dernegi 2006, Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006). Ensure that agri-environmental measures for the species in the EU are well targeted and implemented, and focus on mowing date and methods suitable for the species. Current uptake of agri-environment measures covers less than 25% of the respective national populations (BirdLife International Corncrake Conservation Team 2015). Agri-environment measures should be restored in Latvia and Slovakia and an adapted agri-environment menu is required in important breeding areas in Transylvania (Romania) to support conservation of Corncrakes and High Nature Value grasslands (BirdLife International Corncrake Conservation Team 2015). Increase the area of suitable habitat with protected status. Restore lost habitat where possible. Conduct further research into the species's ecology and demography (Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006). Work with farmers and land managers to ensure that traditional farming methods are retained, areas of grass are left uncut and harvest times are delayed (Doga Dernegi 2006). Monitor levels of illegal trapping and hunting (Koffijberg and Schaffer 2006).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory, although isolated breeding populations east and south of the Black Sea may be resident or only undertake local movements (Snow and Perrins 1998). It usually migrates on a narrow front, utilising two major migration routes (south-west, and south to south-east passages across Europe) and uses regular staging areas (Snow and Perrins 1998). Family groups and non-breeding birds begin to migrate in July, but the majority of the species migrate in early September, arriving in African wintering grounds during October. The species returns to its breeding areas in March (Vegvari 2002), where breeding begins in late April or early May, occasionally up to three weeks earlier in southern areas (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is gregarious for much of the year, migrating in flocks of between 10-50 to 400 birds (Africa) and congregating in groups of few to 1,000 birds in the non-breeding season (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Urban et al. 1986), exceptionally it gathers in flocks of up to 4,000 during the moulting period (Cramp and Simmons 1980). Whilst breeding, pairs are solitary with large nesting territories, although immature and unmated birds may remain in groups of 6-10 individuals (Cramp and Simmons 1980). Every two years adults undergo a complete moulting period, after breeding but before leaving for wintering grounds, throughout which they are flightless for around six weeks (Urban et al. 1986). This species is diurnal, feeding during the day and roosting during the night on the ground or in water in large numbers (the same roost is often used every night, and sometimes every year) (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Urban et al. 1986). Habitat Breeding During the breeding season this species utilises a wide variety of shallow wetlands, including high altitude, treeless moors or bogs (where the main vegetation is Sphagnum moss or Ericaceae) usually with some standing water, and swampy forest clearings, reedy marshes and rice paddies (Cramp and Simmons 1980). The species requires inaccessible ground nesting-sites, so is commonly associated with quaking bogs and other impassible mires, especially in the vicinity of Alnus carr woodland or seasonally flooded riverine forest (Cramp and Simmons 1980). In Central Asia the species may use drier forested areas (such as pine or mixed birch/pine woodland) if water is readily available (Cramp and Simmons 1980), but it generally avoids heavily wooded areas (Urban et al. 1986). The species moults in its breeding habitat after breeding, specifically requiring shallow waters or high reed cover for concealment during this vulnerable flightless period (Cramp and Simmons 1980). Non-breeding The non-breeding wintering and migration habitats of the species include floodland, swampy meadows, shallow sheltered bays, rice paddies (Cramp and Simmons 1980), pastures and savannah-like areas (such as open holm oak woodlands in the Iberian Peninsula) (Meine and Archibald 1996). The species may also be found roosting on mudflats or sandbanks along rivers, lakes and reservoirs during this season (Urban et al. 1986, Meine and Archibald 1996) and undertake flights of up to 20 km (Cramp and Simmons 1980) to forage in agricultural fields (Meine and Archibald 1996, Vegvari 2002) (due to human encroachment and destruction of its preferred habitats) (Cramp and Simmons 1980). Diet The species is omnivorous in both breeding and non-breeding seasons, the plant component of its diet consisting of grass roots and shoots, rhizomes, tubers (e.g. potatoes), the leaves of crops and wild herbs (e.g. brassicas, clover, nettle, chickweed), pondweed, the berries of Empetrum and Vaccinium, cereal grain (e.g. wheat, barley, oats, rye, maize, rice), peas, olives, acorns, cedarnuts, groundnuts Arachis, and the pods of Cajanus (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Urban et al. 1986). Animal matter in this species' diet includes adult (beetles, flies) and larval (Lepidoptera) insects, snails, earthworms, millipedes, spiders, woodlice, frogs, slow-worms, lizards, snakes, small mammals (rodents and shrews), fish and occasionally the eggs and young of small birds (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Urban et al. 1986). Breeding site The nest is a mound of wetland vegetation (which may be re-used from year to year), generally placed in or near water in inaccessible undisturbed bog, heath, marsh, mire (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Urban et al. 1986), or sedge meadow (Malik and Prange 1995). Management information The removal of willow bushes, reeds and bog grass from areas in the Kremmener Luch nature reserve, central Germany, has been successful in providing suitable roosting sites with wide panoramic views which have attracted the species to the area (Malik and Prange 1995). The vegetation was removed during the winter months: willow bushes being cut off and poisoned with arboricid, bog grass being burnt down and reeds being mechanically cut (Malik and Prange 1995). Other management efforts in western Europe include the burial or relocation of utility lines, and programs to encourage the planting of lure crops and the use of waste grain for diversionary feeding (away from agricultural crops) (Meine and Archibald 1996).","In both its breeding and non-breeding ranges this species is principally threatened by habitat loss and degradation through dam construction, urbanisation and agricultural expansion (including changes in land-use, intensification, expanded irrigation systems and conversion of traditional holm oak pastures) (Meine and Archibald 1996). Breeding In parts of its breeding range that are heavily developed the species is threatened by nest disturbance from tourism and recreation which reduces its breeding success by increasing the incidence of successful nest predation by corvids, wild boar and foxes (Meine and Archibald 1996). Egg collecting is also a threat to the breeding population in Turkey (Meine and Archibald 1996). Non-breeding Along its migrational routes and in its wintering grounds the Common Crane is particularly threatened by habitat fragmentation and the loss of many smaller traditional feeding and roosting sites, leading to increasing concentrations of large flocks in smaller areas, and therefore increased competition (Cramp and Simmons 1980, Alonso et al. 1994, Meine and Archibald 1996). Pesticide poisoning may also be affecting cranes along migration routes and in some wintering areas, especially where they depend primarily on grain from agricultural fields (Meine and Archibald 1996). Collisions with utility lines are frequent in highly developed areas along migration routes and in winter ranges (collisions being the leading cause of adult mortality at wintering areas in Spain) (Meine and Archibald 1996). Hunting is a significant threat to this species on migration (e.g. through Afghanistan and Pakistan) (Meine and Archibald 1996, Nawaz et al. 2006) and illegal shooting has been identified as a problem in other areas (including Portugal, southeast Europe, Egypt and Sudan) (Meine and Archibald 1996).","The global population is estimated to number c.491,000-503,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 113,000-185,000 pairs, which equates to 225,000-370,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

The following information refers to the species's European range only: The species is legally protected across all of its European range, although stronger enforcement is needed in many areas. The European Crane Working Group (ECWG) has coordinated conservation activities including research, monitoring, colour banding, habitat protection, education, and recommended changes in agricultural policy, since the mid-1980s. Some breeding areas are within protected areas in Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Spain and Germany. Intensive habitat management in western Europe, including the creation and restoration of wetlands, agreements with private land owners to protect key resting and wintering habitats, clearing of dense vegetation from roosting areas, development of habitat management plans for protected areas, burial or relocation of utility lines, programs to encourage planting of lure crops and use of waste grain for diversionary feeding; and compensation programs for farmers suffering crop damage have resulted in breeding pairs resettling former breeding habitats. Breeding populations have been most closely monitored in Scandinavia, the Baltic nations, Poland, and Germany and in recent years, surveys have been conducted regularly at key staging and wintering areas in Russia, Spain, Germany, France, Portugal, Hungary, Sweden and Estonia. Intensive research in Europe has focused on demographics, life history, feeding and wintering behaviour, and habitat and conservation needs (Meine and Archibald 1996). Reintroduction of the species to the southwest U.K. began in 2010 with released birds establishing territories and nests (The Great Crane Project 2014).Conservation Actions Proposed The following information refers to the species's European range only: Legal protection of wetlands and other habitats in the species's breeding grounds, along its migratory routes, and in its wintering grounds should be strengthened. Cooperative international conservation programmes involving countries along the main migratory routes should be established and international research expanded. Protected areas at important breeding, staging, resting, and wintering areas should be established or expanded and enforcement and management of existing protected areas strengthened.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour All populations of this species undergo post-breeding dispersive movements (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Populations breeding in the Palearctic are highly migratory (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) whereas others are only sedentary (such as E. g. dimorpha on Madagascar), nomadic (del Hoyo et al. 1992) or partially migratory (Hancock and Kushlan 1984). The timing of breeding varies geographically (del Hoyo et al. 1992) although, in general, European and north Asian populations breed in spring and summer (March to July) and the breeding of tropical populations coincides with periods of high rainfall (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests in colonies sometimes of thousands of pairs and often with other species (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Some populations also breed solitarily or in small single-species groups of under 100 pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1992). When not breeding the species commonly feeds solitarily or in loose flocks during the day (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Habitat It inhabits fresh, brackish or saline wetlands (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and shows a preference for shallow waters (10-15 cm deep) in open, unvegetated sites where water levels and dissolved oxygen levels fluctuate daily, tidally or seasonally, and where fish are concentrated in pools or at the water's surface (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Habitats frequented include the margins of shallow lakes, rivers, streams and pools, open swamps and marshes, flooded meadows, rafts of floating water hyacinth Eichornia spp. on African lakes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), flood-plains (del Hoyo et al. 1992), lagoons, irrigation canals, aquaculture ponds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), saltpans (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and rice fields (which are especially important in areas with few remaining natural wetland habitats) (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species also occupies dry fields, inland savannas and cattle pastures (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and some populations are almost entirely coastal, inhabiting rocky or sandy shores, reefs, estuaries, mudflats, saltmarshes, mangroves and tidal creeks (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Diet It is a highly opportunistic feeder (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), taking mainly small fish under 20 g in weight and less than 10 cm long (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (averaging 4 cm) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), aquatic and terrestrial insects (e.g. beetles, dragonfly larvae, mole crickets and crickets) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and crustaceans (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (e.g. Palaemonetes spp., amphipods, phylopods, crabs and exotic species of crayfish) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) as well as amphibians, molluscs (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (snails and bivalves) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), spiders, worms, reptiles and small birds (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The species may nest on the ground in protected sites (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or up to 20 m high on rocks, in reedbeds, bushes, trees or mangroves (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It usually nests in single- or mixed-species colonies where nests may be placed 1-4 m apart (sometimes less than 1 m apart) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It may feed up to 7-13 km away from breeding colonies during the breeding season (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Management information An artificial island nesting site created in the Camargue, France succeeded in attracting nesting pairs to the area (Hafner 2000). A study in north-west Italy suggests that existing nesting sites should be protected and that breeding habitats should be actively managed in order to maintain suitable habitat characteristics (Fasola and Alieri 1992). The creation of a network of new nesting sites spaced at 4-10 km in relation to available foraging habitats in zones currently without suitable nesting sites is also recommended (Fasola and Alieri 1992).","The species is threatened by wetland degradation and loss through drainage for agriculture (e.g. rice-farming and fishing), changes in current management practices (e.g. of rice-farming) and contamination from agricultural and industrial operations (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).

It breeds from May to August (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary pairs (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996), adults leaving the breeding grounds before the juveniles between July and August (Hayman et al. 1986). The return migration in the spring peaks between April and early-May (Hayman et al. 1986). The species feeds in small flocks during the breeding season, but on passage and in winter feeding flocks of tens to thousands of individuals may occur (Hayman et al. 1986, Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on humid moss, lichen and hummock tundra (del Hoyo et al. 1996), low-lying marshes in moss tundra (Johnsgard 1981), shrub tundra, open bogs in forest, peatlands, alpine tundra (del Hoyo et al. 1996), highland bogs , moors (Johnsgard 1981), and swampy highland heaths with high abundances of sphagnum moss and heather (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It shows a preference for nesting on short vegetation less than 15 cm tall (Ratcliffe 1977). Non-breeding When on passage and in its winter quarters (del Hoyo et al. 1996) the species frequents freshwater wetlands (Urban et al. 1986), moist grasslands (Urban et al. 1986), pastures (del Hoyo et al. 1996), agricultural land (e.g. stubble, ploughed or fallow fields) (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996) and highland steppe (Urban et al. 1986), also foraging on tidal shores, coastal rocky outcrops (Johnsgard 1981), intertidal flats (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and saltmarshes (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996) in shallow bays and estuaries (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of insects (especially the adults, pupae and larvae of beetles (del Hoyo et al. 1996), larval Lepidoptera, locusts and grasshoppers (Urban et al. 1986)), as well as earthworms, spiders, millipedes, snails, polycheate worms (del Hoyo et al. 1996), crustaceans (Johnsgard 1981) and some plant material (e.g. berries, seeds and grass) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow scrape on bare ground in flat, sparse areas with short vegetation (less than 15 cm) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species is a solitary nester, although in optimal habitats neighbouring pairs may nest only a few hundred metres apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Management information Extensive grazing of wetland grasslands (e.g. c.0.5 cows per hectare) was found to attract a higher abundance of the species in Hungary (Baldi et al. 2005), and in the UK the species shows a preference for nesting on heathlands and moors managed by rotational burning (a management strategy used to encourage grouse) as this keeps the vegetation short and prevents grasses from being displaced by heathers (Ratcliffe 1977, Johnsgard 1981).","The species has suffered minor range contractions due to the cultivation and afforestation of heathlands (Ratcliffe 1977, del Hoyo et al. 1996), and is susceptible to very cold winter temperatures and severe weather conditions (Ratcliffe 1977).

It departs from its breeding grounds from August to September, the return migration in the spring beginning in late-February or March (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species breeds from May to August (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary well-dispersed pairs (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996) although where suitable habitat is restricted it may also breed in loose groups of 2-5 pairs and adults may roost communally at night (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species migrates in small parties (Hayman et al. 1986) commonly of 3-6 individuals (occasionally up to 20-80 individuals [del Hoyo et al. 1996]) and it remains gregarious throughout the winter (Hayman et al. 1986). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on flat open uplands, on mountain ridges and plateaus with sparse vegetation, and on coastal and inland Arctic tundra of moss, short grass or lichen and bare patches of rock (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding On passage the species stages in exposed areas with short vegetation, such as heathlands and fallow or ploughed fields, and during the winter its habitats include stony and shrubby steppe, semi-desert, ploughed farmland and the margins of cultivation (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Its diet consists of insects (e.g. beetles, adult and larval Diptera, larval Lepidoptera, grasshoppers, crickets, earwigs and ants), spiders, snails and earthworms, as well as plant matter such as leaves, seeds, berries and flowers (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (e.g. of Empetrum spp. [Johnsgard 1981]). Breeding site The nest is a shallow scrape on bare ground or in short vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species is a solitary nester but where suitable habitat is restricted it may also breed in loose groups of 2-5 pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Nests are normally placed between 200 m and several kilometres apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","Predicted climate change now presents a potentially catastrophic threat to the species, as this and many other boreal land birds are wholly dependent on the ecological conditions currently prevailing in northern Eurasia. Cause for recent declines in Europe might be heavy persecution in North Africa; amelioration of climate in breeding area may also be significant factor. Species has appeared incapable of truly colonizing northern England as a breeding bird, despite availability of seemingly suitable habitat, presumably due to number of sheep, degree of recreational use and increasing acidification of soils.

It breeds from May to August (Hayman et al. 1986) with males gathering in suitable lekking areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Flint et al. 1984) and females nesting solitarily or in semi-colonial groups (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species departs the breeding grounds between late-June and August, returning from the wintering grounds from March to mid-May (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species migrates in large flocks of hundreds or thousands of individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and forms huge dense groups on its wintering grounds (Hayman et al. 1986). The species inhabits tundra habitats from the coast to the Arctic treeline (Johnsgard et al. 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996) during the breeding season, requiring adjacent foraging, lekking and nesting areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It shows a preference for dry mounds and slopes with low willow Salix spp. and dwarf birch Betula spp. as lekking areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), and dry patches of tall sedge as nesting sites (Snow and Perrins 1998). Suitable foraging habitats include littoral belts, deltas (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal saltmarshes (Johnsgard et al. 1981) and extensive lowland freshwater wetlands such as small shallow lakes with marginal vegetation (Johnsgard et al. 1981, Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), grassy hummocky marshes (Johnsgard et al. 1981, Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), and damp swampy grasslands (Johnsgard et al. 1981, Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996), with shallow pools or ditches (del Hoyo et al. 1996). During the non-breeding season the species occupies the muddy margins of brackish, saline and alkaline lakes, ponds, pools, rivers, marshes and food-plains (del Hoyo et al. 1996), as well as freshly mown or grazed short-sward grasslands (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996) and wheat- or rice-fields (del Hoyo et al. 1996), usually roosting at night in the shallow waters of lake shores (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species rarely utilises intertidal habitats (Hayman et al. 1986) but may frequent tidal mudflats and lagoons in India (del Hoyo et al. 1996). During the breeding season the species's diet consists almost entirely of adult and larval terrestrial and aquatic insects such as Coleoptera and Diptera (del Hoyo et al. 1996). On passage and during the winter the species takes insects (e.g. caddisflies, water-bugs, mayflies and grasshoppers), small crustaceans, spiders, small molluscs, annelid worms, frogs, small fish and the seeds of rice and other cereals, sedges, grasses and aquatic plants (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The nest is a shallow scrape (del Hoyo et al. 1996) concealed in marsh vegetation or meadow grass (del Hoyo et al. 1996) on damp ground (Johnsgard et al. 1981) usually more than 100 m away from the nearest lek site (Johnsgard et al. 1981). The species nests solitarily or semi-colonially, neighbouring nests occasionally only a few metres apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Management information Intensive grazing of grassland (&gt; 1 cow per hectare) was found to attract a higher abundance of this species in Hungary (Baldi et al. 2005).","The species is threatened by petroleum pollution (Grishanov 2006), wetland and flood-plain drainage ( del Hoyo et al. 1996, Grishanov 2006) (for irrigation and water management) (Grishanov 2006), peat-extraction, and land abandonment and changing land management practices that lead to scrub and reed overgrowth (Grishanov 2006). The species may also suffer future population declines and range contractions as a result of global climate change (Zöckler 2002), and is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007), avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974, Hubalek et al. 2005) and avian malaria (Mendes et al. 2005), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.","The European population is estimated at 265,000-1,650,000 calling or lekking males, which equates to 531,000-3,310,000 mature individuals or 797,000-4,970,000 individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Europe forms approximately 50% of the global range so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 1,594,000-9,940,000 individuals. The global population was previously estimated to number 2,000,000-2,600,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2006).

Non-breeding In its winter range this species inhabits a wide variety of habitats, such as small pools, ditches, riverbanks (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), streams, dam shores (Yalden 1992), marshy areas (Johnsgard 1981), estuaries, freshwater seeps on coastal shores, tidal creeks in mangrove swamps and saltmarshes, harbours, docks (Yalden 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) and filtration tanks of sewage works (Yalden 1992). It will also forage on grassland along roadsides and occasionally in gardens (Yalden 1992, del Hoyo et al. 1996), but it generally avoids large coastal mudflats (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet The diet of this species consists of adult and larval insects (such as beetles and Diptera), spiders, molluscs, snails, crustaceans, annelids, and occasionally frogs, toads, tadpoles and small fish, as well as plant material (including seeds) (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996).

Southward movements to the wintering grounds occur between June and early November, with the species being present in the north and equatorial tropics from late-August to early-April, and in southern Africa from October to March (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). The return passage to northern breeding grounds occurs between late-February and mid-May (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996), where the species breeds between late April and June (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In mild winters some birds may also remain in the breeding grounds of southern Scandinavia (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species generally occurs in low concentrations during passage and at stop-over sites, although it may occur in small scattered groups of up to 30 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996) in the winter, with aggregations of over 50 being unusual (Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding During the breeding season this species inhabits damp areas in swampy, old pine, spruce or alder woodland and montane forest with many fallen and rotten tree stumps, marshy forest floors and heavy carpets of lichens and mosses, generally in the vicinity of rivers, streams, swamps, ponds, lakes (Johnsgard 1981) and bogs (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season this species shows a preference for a wider variety of inland freshwater habitats such as marshes, lake edges, sewage farms, small dams and ponds, ditches, riverbanks and forest streams, often near villages and cultivation (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996) (although less often in the vicinity of woodland) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It is also very rarely found in intertidal areas such as creeks and the channels of saltmarches (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet The species is omnivorous, although its diet is predominantly made up of aquatic and terrestrial insects (Snow and Perrins 1998) (e.g. dragonfly larvae, ants, waterbugs, moth larvae, and the adults and larvae of beetles, Diptera and Trichoptera), annelids, small crustaceans, spiders and fish, as well as plant fragments (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site This species frequently nests high in trees in the abandoned nests of passerine species such as Common Woodpigeon Columba palumbus, thrushes Turdus spp. (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996), crows, jays and shrikes (Johnsgard 1981), but may also nest in squirrel dreys (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998), on natural platforms up to 20 m high (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and occasionally on tree stumps or mounds of accumulated pine needles, among branches and tree roots, or amongst fallen trees on the ground (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998).",This species is susceptible to avian influenza (strain H5N1) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).,"The global population is estimated to number c.1,200,000-3,600,000 individuals (Wetlands International, 2015). The European population is estimated at 616,000-1,050,000 pairs, which equates to 1,230,000-2,100,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is a full migrant (Hayman et al. 1986, Smit and Piersma 1989, del Hoyo et al. 1996), breeding in the subarctic and arctic zone of Fennoscandia and Siberia (Smit and Piersma 1989). On passage to its wintering grounds the majority of the species travels overland on a broad front, although there is also an important route down the west coast of Europe (Smit and Piersma 1989, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Females begin to moving south in early-June, the males following during July, and juveniles migrating from August to September (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The movements of this species are characterised by long flights between staging areas (such as the Wadden Sea, Dutch delta region, southern Hungary, south-east Greece, central Turkey, the Black and Caspian Seas, central Kazakhstan, Lake Baikal, Chang Lake (Ussuriland), central Yakutia, Sakhalin, Japan and Korea) (del Hoyo et al. 1996), those birds wintering in Sahel and northern savanna zones (e.g. Mali, Nigeria and Chad (Smit and Piersma 1989)) also cross the Sahara (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Arrival in Africa begins in August and peaks in October (Hayman et al. 1986), the species being present throughout the tropics mainly between October and April (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and returning to arctic breeding grounds between late-April and mid-May (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Few birds remain in the tropics during the breeding season, but non-breeders may spend the summer just south of the breeding grounds (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species breeds in dispersed pairs and is often seen singly, although it is also common in parties of up to 20 and exceptionally over 100 (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Adults typically moult in large flocks (Hayman et al. 1986) in staging areas in their arctic breeding range before moving to wintering grounds (del Hoyo et al. 1996). This species is both a diurnal and nocturnal feeder (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding During the breeding season this species inhabits lowland and upland (but not montane) regions, in wooded and open tundra (Snow and Perrins 1998), marshes, swampy pine or birch forest near the arctic tree-line, and also more open areas such as heathland and shrub tundra (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding During migration and on its wintering grounds (Flint et al. 1984) this species frequents a variety of freshwater and brackish wetlands such as sewage farms, irrigated rice fields, brackish lagoons, salt-marshes, salt-pans, sheltered muddy coastal shores (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and mudflats (Johnsgard 1981), marshes and marshy lake edges (Johnsgard 1981, Urban et al. 1986), small reservoirs, pools and flooded grasslands (Urban et al. 1986). Diet The species is carnivorous, its diet consisting chiefly of aquatic insects and their larvae (especially swimming beetles and hemipterans), terrestrial flying insects (such as craneflies), small crustaceans, molluscs, polycheate worms, and small fish and amphibians up to 6-7 cm long (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest of this species is a shallow depression (Snow and Perrins 1998) positioned in grass tussocks (del Hoyo et al. 1996), on sphagnum moss (Flint et al. 1984), or in fairly dry areas of forest amongst low vegetation such as dwarf willows (Johnsgard 1981). Nest sites are often selected near dead trees or other suitable look-out perches (Johnsgard 1981).","This species is threatened by habitat loss in its wintering range and on migration: wetland sites in Ghana are being degraded through coastal erosion and developments involving drainage and land reclamation (Ntiamboa-Baidu 1991); and in China and South Korea important migrational staging areas around the coast of the Yellow Sea are being lost through land reclamation and degraded as a result of declining river flows (from water abstraction), increased pollution, unsustainable harvesting of benthic fauna and a reduction in the amount of sediment being carried into the area by the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers (Barter 2002, Barter 2006, Kelin and Qiang 2006).","The global population is estimated to number c.110,000-270,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 20,500-54,000 pairs, which equates to 41,000-108,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). National population estimates include: &lt; c.10,000 individuals on migration and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in China; c.50-1,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in Taiwan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Stable,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,Conservation Actions UnderwayThe following information refers to the species's European range only: The species is listed on Annex II (B) of the EU Birds Directive and Annex II of the Bern Convention.Conservation Actions ProposedThe following information refers to the species's European range only: Intensive grazing of grassland (&gt;1 cow per hectare) was found to attract a higher abundance of this species in Hungary (Baldi et al. 2005).,Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The Wadden Sea for example is used by many Fennoscandian birds as a stop-over and moulting site from late-April to mid-May (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Most palearctic birds are trans-Saharan migrants (del Hoyo et al. 1996), the main autumn passage through northern and temperate Europe occurring from the second week of July to late-October (Snow and Perrins 1998). One parent (usually the female) leaves the breeding territory first from late-June to early July (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), with the other parent and juveniles following around 3-6 weeks later (Snow and Perrins 1998). Flocks arrive in southern Africa and Australia from August to September, and depart again in March for the northward return migration (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species departs for its breeding grounds during the evening (Hockey et al. 2005) and once there it breeds between late-April and June (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Some non-breeding birds may also remain in the south throughout the summer (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species normally breeds in very dispersed pairs (Johnsgard 1981), but on passage it can occur singly or in small flocks (flocks of 20-25 are common in southern Africa) (Snow and Perrins 1998), although congregations of 100 or more may very rarely occur at high tide or at roosting sites (Urban et al. 1986). This species feeds both diurnally and nocturnally (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding This species breeds in the boreal forest zone from sea level to 1,200 m in Norway (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998)(although predominantly up to 450 m) (Snow and Perrins 1998), in swampy forest clearings, woody moorland, open bogs and marshes (including raised and blanket bogs) (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and eutrophic lakes with margins of dead and decaying vegetation (Johnsgard 1981). It avoids bare or broken barren expanses, mountain escarpments, and closed forests with very dense, tall vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding In its wintering grounds this species frequents a variety of freshwater, marine and artificial wetlands, including swamps, open muddy or rocky shores of lakes and large rivers, sewage farms, saltworks, inundated rice-fields (del Hoyo et al. 1996), ponds, reservoirs (Snow and Perrins 1998), flooded grasslands (Hockey et al. 2005), saltmarshes, sandy or muddy coastal flats, mangroves, estuaries (del Hoyo et al. 1996), lagoonsand pools on tidal reefs (Snow and Perrins 1998) or exposed coral (Urban et al. 1986), although it generally avoids open coastline (del Hoyo et al. 1996). On migration this species occurs on inland flooded meadows, dried-up lakes, sandbars and marshes (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet This species is chiefly carnivorous, its diet consisting of insects and their larvae (especially beetles), crustaceans, annelids, molluscs, amphibians (del Hoyo et al. 1996), small fish (mullet Liza spp., clinids Clinus spp. and tilapia Oreochromis spp.) (Hockey et al. 2005) and occasionally rodents (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow scrape on open ground, often in clearings in woods (Snow and Perrins 1998), and is typically placed next to a piece of dead wood (del Hoyo et al. 1996), or beside rocks, trees (Johnsgard 1981), fences and sticks (for use as nest markers) (Snow and Perrins 1998).","In the Chinese, North Korean and South Korean regions of the Yellow Sea this species is threatened by the degradation and loss of its preferred wetland habitats through environmental pollution, reduced river flows and human disturbance (Kelin and Qiang 2006). Within Europe the species has suffered in some areas from habitat degradation caused by off-road vehicles or dry conditions causing vegetation to become rank (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","The global population is estimated to number c.440,000-1,500,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 98,700-202,000 pairs, which equates to 197,000-405,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Habitat Breeding The species breeds on coastal saltmarshes, inland wet grasslands with short swards (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (including cultivated meadows) (Johnsgard 1981), grassy marshes, swampy heathlands (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and swampy moors (Johnsgard 1981). Non-breeding On passage the species may frequent inland flooded grasslands (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and the silty shores of rivers and lakes (Flint et al. 1984), but during the winter it is largely coastal (del Hoyo et al. 1996), occupying rocky, muddy and sandy beaches, saltmarshes, tidal mudflats, saline and freshwater coastal lagoons (del Hoyo et al. 1996), tidal estuaries (Johnsgard 1981), saltworks and sewage farms (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Breeding When breeding its diet consists of insects, spiders and annelid worms (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding During the non-breeding season the species takes insects, spiders and annelid worms (del Hoyo et al. 1996), as well as molluscs, crustaceans (especially amphipods e.g. Corophium spp.) (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and occasionally small fish and tadpoles (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest s a shallow scrape or hollow (Snow and Perrins 1998) on a hummock or at the base of a tuft (Flint et al. 1984) of grass (del Hoyo et al. 1996), often well hidden by overhanging leaves (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species usually nests solitarily inland (less than 10 pairs/km2) but in loosely colonial groups (up to 100-300 pairs/km2) on the coast (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","The species is threatened by the loss of breeding and wintering habitats through agricultural intensification, wetland drainage, flood control, afforestation, land reclamation, industrial development (del Hoyo et al. 1996), encroachment of Spartina spp. on mudflats (Evans 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996), improvement of marginal grasslands (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (e.g. by drainage, inorganic fertilising and re-seeding) (Baines 1988), coastal barrage construction (Burton 2006), and heavy grazing (e.g. of saltmarshes) (Norris et al. 1998). The species is also threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats from construction work (UK) (Burton et al. 2002a) and foot-traffic on footpaths (Burton et al. 2002b). It is vulnerable to severe cold periods on its Western European wintering grounds (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and suffers from nest predation by introduced predators (e.g. European hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus) on some islands (Jackson 2001). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","The global population is estimated to number c.1,300,000-3,100,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 340,000-484,000 pairs, which equates to 680,000-968,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

The EU commisioned a Management Plan for this huntable bird species considered to be in unfavourable status (Technical Report - 2009 - 031) (Jensen et al. 2009).Conservation Actions ProposedThe following information refers to the species's European range only: Optimal breeding conditions for this species may be provided by creating a mosaic of unflooded grassland, winter-flooded grassland and shallow pools (Ausden et al. 2002). Winter flooding of grasslands is beneficial to the species as it helps to keep the sward height short and open and also creates pools which provide a source of aquatic invertebrates in the spring (Ausden et al. 2002, Olsen and Schmidt 2004). Such shallow pools on coastal grazing marshes should be maintained until the end of June (Ausden et al. 2003). The number of breeding pairs on improved grassland was successfully increased on a reserve in Wales by the implementation of a two-year rotation of chisel ploughing, as well as a seasonal sheep and cattle grazing regime and a controlled increase in the water-level (Squires and Allcorn 2006). At Lower Lough Erne in Northern Ireland the breeding population of the species increased considerably as a result of cutting rush beds in mid-winter (although the species nested on uncut areas, chicks benefited from the presence of adjacent short, open areas for feeding) (Robson and Allcorn 2006). Low-level grazing of salt marshes (e.g. c. 1 cow per hectare) does not appear to affect the species and may even be beneficial to breeding populations (Norris et al. 1997, Ausden et al. 2005), although cattle should not be put onto the marsh until towards the end of the nesting season (e.g. late-May or early-June) to minimise the risk of nest trampling (Norris et al. 1997). There is also evidence that too heavy grazing can be detrimental (Evans 1986). The species is known to show increased hatching success when ground predators have been excluded by erecting protective fences around nesting areas (Jackson 2001), and in the U.K. there is evidence that the removal of Spartina anglica from tidal mudflats using a herbicide is beneficial for the species (Evans 1986).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is a full migrant, travelling overland on a broad front across Europe and the Middle East (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The adults start to move away from the breeding grounds in late-June, with juveniles following in late-August, arriving in tropical Africa from late-July through August to October (Snow and Perrins 1998). On this southern migration many birds frequent stop-over sites to the north of the Mediterranean (especially in France and Italy), after which they overfly the Sahara (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Spring departure from the wintering grounds begins in late-March to early-April (Snow and Perrins 1998), with breeding areas starting to be reoccupied from late-April (early June in northern Russia) (Snow and Perrins 1998), and with breeding occurring between May and mid-July (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Some non-breeding birds may also remain in the south throughout the summer (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species nests in well-dispersed solitary pairs (from 1-10 pairs per km2 to 50 pairs per km2 in forest tundra) (del Hoyo et al. 1996), but in winter it may occur in small scattered groups or larger flocks (20-50 individuals), and concentrations can exceed 1,000 individuals on migration (Urban et al. 1986). Habitat Breeding During the breeding season this species inhabits open, swampy areas in boreal forest (del Hoyo et al. 1996), scrubland between tundra and coniferous forest with willow, dwarf birch or spruce (Snow and Perrins 1998), wet heathlands, and extensive mossy, sedgy or grassy marshes (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season this species is less associated with woodlands, being more commonly found in open areas such as the margins of inland freshwater lakes and reservoirs (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996), muddy marshlands, grassy stream banks, sewage farms, wet paddyfields, small temporary pools (del Hoyo et al. 1996), permanent swamps, flooded grassland and irrigation channels (Urban et al. 1986). It rarely occurs in coastal habitats, but may be found along the creeks of saltmarshes and mangrove swamps (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Breeding Whilst on the breeding grounds this species is chiefly carnivorous, taking small insects (up to 2 cm long), especially the aquatic forms such as dytiscid or hydrophilid beetles, Hemiptera and the larvae of Diptera such as midges (Johnsgard 1981). Non-breeding During the non-breeding season the species has a more varied diet consisting of aquatic and terrestrial insects and their larvae, worms, spiders, crustaceans, gastropod molluscs, small fish (up to 2 cm long) and frogs, as well as plant matter such as seeds (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a scrape on the ground amongst dense vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) or raised on a tussock or slight ridge, and can sometimes be surrounded by water (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also nest in trees in the abandoned nests of other species (del Hoyo et al. 1996) such as thrushes (Snow and Perrins 1998).","The species is threatened in some European countries (such as Finland) from exploitation, and peatland drainage and destruction for forestry and agriculture (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The populations in southern Sweden, Germany and Poland have also declined, possibly due to the threats of climatic change (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species is susceptible to both avian botulism (Hubalek et al. 2005) and avian malaria (Mendes et al. 2005), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.","The global population is estimated to number c.3,100,000-3,500,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 763,000-1,520,000 pairs, which equates to 1,530,000-3,040,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

The main passage to and from Russia is believed to occur east of the Black Sea (Snow and Perrins 1998), with only a few birds crossing Europe (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (during south-west to south-south-west movements into and out of Russia a small proportion of the species regularly crosses Slovakia, Hungary, the Balkans, Italy and the eastern Mediterranean) (Snow and Perrins 1998). In eastern central Asia the species passes through Mongolia; central, north-eastern and coastal China; Korea (on southward migration only), Japan, Myanmar, Malaysia and Sumatra (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species leaves its breeding range between the first half of July and early-September (Snow and Perrins 1998), arriving in its wintering grounds in September (del Hoyo et al. 1996). For those birds wintering in West Africa, the Nile valley in Sudan is commonly used as a stop over site before crossing the Sahara (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species is present in West Africa from September to mid-April (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and departs again between the second half of March and April, passing through central Asia in early-April to early-May, and reoccupying breeding areas again by mid-April to mid-May (Snow and Perrins 1998). Most non-breeders remain in the winter quarters or at intermediate sites during the breeding season (del Hoyo et al. 1996). This species forages singly or in groups of less than 20 (Hockey et al. 2005), although flocks can sometimes exceed 300 (Urban et al. 1986, Hockey et al. 2005). It usually nests solitarily or in loose colonies with pairs spaced less than 10 m apart (Hayman et al. 1986). The species is active both diurnally and nocturnally (independent of moon phases) (Hockey et al. 2005). Habitat Breeding This species inhabits warm inland wetlands from open steppe to boreal forest, including shallow freshwater and brackish marshlands, grassy or marshy lake-edges (Johnsgard 1981), river valleys, flooded meadows (Snow and Perrins 1998) and occasionally salt-lakes (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species typically occurs on the margins of inland freshwater and brackish wetlands such as rice paddy-fields, swamps, salt-pans, salt-marshes, sewage works and marshy lake-edges, and although it is rare on open coastlines it can occasionally be found on estuaries, lagoons and intertidal mudflats (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Hockey et al. 2005). Diet This species is carnivorous, its diet consisting of small fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and both aquatic and terrestrial insects (Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest of this species is a shallow depression (Snow and Perrins 1998), often on a mound at the marshy edge of a lagoon, lake or pool (Johnsgard 1981).","Breeding The species has disappeared as a breeding bird from eastern Europe, Belarus, Maldova and Russia as a result of steppe habitat losses due to agricultural intensification (such as increased ploughing (Tomkovich 1992)), and possibly also due to egg-collecting (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It may also be threatened by industrial pollution from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (organic pollutants) in the Lake Baikal region in Russia, where high levels of pollutants have been recorded in its eggs (Lebedev et al. 1998). Non-breeding In China and South Korea important migrational staging areas around the coast of the Yellow Sea are being lost through land reclamation and degraded as a result of declining river flows (from water abstraction), increased pollution, unsustainable harvesting of benthic fauna and a reduction in the amount of sediment being carried into the area by the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers (Barter 2002, Barter 2006). The species is also threatened by habitat loss in its wintering range, as wetland sites in Ghana are being degraded through coastal erosion and developments involving drainage and land reclamation (Ntiamoa-Baidu 1991). It may be susceptible to future outbreaks of avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974), partly due to its choice of habitat (it often shows a preference for sewage works) (Hockey et al. 2005).","The global population is estimated to number c.260,000-1,200,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 12,100-30,300 pairs, which equates to 24,100-60,600 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Males prefer territories in areas with vegetation lower than eye level and elevated sites such as rocks, trees or hummocks for displaying on. Generally laying occurs in May and June. It normally lays eight to eleven eggs. The nest is a shallow scrape with a thin lining in thick vegetation which usually partially covers it. It feeds on buds and twigs of Salix and birch (Betula) in winter. From spring to autumn leaves and berries of Vaccinium and Empetrum are important parts of its diet. It is sedentary in the U.K. and Scandinavia, only making short-range altitudinal movements, but at least partially migratory elsewhere (de Juana et al. 2016).","The species is hunted everywhere except the Baltic Countries, Belarus and China. In the Russian tundra annual bags estimated at c. 8,000,000 birds (c. 2,000,000 west of the Urals) but professional hunting of the species ceased in Russia at the end of the 20th century (de Juana et al. 2016). The species is less intensively hunted in North America. The species probably tolerates heavy levels of shooting, however in combination with other pressures, such as reductions in habitat quality and extent it can have adverse effects (Madge and McGowan 2002). Important declines in Finland were attributed to excessive hunting. Range contractions in Europe have been attributed to climatic changes (de Juana et al. 2016).

Possible factors include increased logging in the breeding range, and large-scale trapping together with agricultural intensification in the non-breeding range.","The species breeds in swampy lowland spruce (Picea) or pine (Pinus) forest with some birches (Betula), willows (Salix) or other deciduous trees. It also uses scrub along riverbanks and around Sphagnum bogs. In flooded pine forests it is frequently found where pines stunted and dead trees are covered with moss. Undergrowth is usually present, usually consisting of horsetail (Equisetum) and bushes such as Rubus (Copete and Garcia 2016). It may benefit from the construction of dams by beavers (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Dale and Hansen 2013, Copete and Garcia 2016). The breeding season starts in May or early June. The nest is usually placed on the ground often near water, among grassy vegetation. Occasionally it is built in a low tree. The clutch, usually four to six eggs, is incubated by both the male and female. The chicks hatch after 11–13 days. They are fed by both parents and leave the nest after 7–10 days. Then they are fed by the parents for another 15 days before they are able to fly. During the breeding season it mostly feeds on seeds and a wide variety of invertebrate species. The species is migratory, wintering mainly in Japan, Korea and eastern China with a small wintering population in southern Kazakhstan and north-west China (Copete and Garcia 2016).","The numbers of this species have declined in the Scandinavian part of its range since 1980. This decline is associated with forest logging and draining of swamps leading to habitat degradation or even destruction. In northern Finland, forest management has led to forest fragmentation resulting in declines in density (Copete and Garcia 2016). However the habitat of the species in Norway where it has also declined has remained rather unchanged (Dale and Hansen 2013). It is suggested that habitat destruction and hunting and trapping, taking place in the east Asian wintering grounds, may be the cause of the species's decline in Norway. Across the global range, agricultural intensification in the wintering range and intensified levels of disturbance, including logging and fire, in the breeding range could be important drivers of the range-wide population decline, and persecution could also contribute (Edenius et al. 2016).","The European population is estimated at 681,000-831,000 pairs, which equates to 1,360,000-1,660,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

It arrives on the breeding grounds from early-May to late-June (Madge and Burn 1988) (depending on local conditions [Kear 2005a]) where it breeds well-dispersed (Snow and Perrins 1998) in single pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1992), occasionally nesting semi-colonially in optimum habitats (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a). After breeding the species undergoes a flightless moulting period lasting for c.30 days between late-June and early-September, gathering in flocks on open waters (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996). Family groups leave the breeding grounds from early-September to late-October (Madge and Burn 1988) and arrive on the wintering grounds from mid-October onwards (Madge and Burn 1988). During this autumn migration some groups may remain at stop-over sites until moved on by cold weather (Madge and Burn 1988). The return northward migration occurs from early-March, with the species travelling in small parties that disperse on arrival in the Arctic (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is gregarious outside of the breeding season, often gathering into large flocks of hundreds or thousands of individuals on the wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a). The species forages by day (where undisturbed [del Hoyo et al. 1992]) and roosts at night on open water (Kear 2005a). Habitat Breeding The species breeds near shallow pools, lakes (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and broad slow-flowing rivers (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a) with emergent littoral vegetation and pondweeds (e.g. Potamogeton spp.) connected to coastal delta areas (Kear 2005a) in open, moist, low-lying sedge-grass or moss-lichen (Kear 2005a) Arctic tundra (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It rarely nests in shrub tundra, and generally avoids forested areas (Kear 2005a). Non-breeding On migration the species frequents shallow ponds (Kear 2005a), lowland and upland lakes (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005a), reservoirs (Madge and Burn 1988), riverine marshes, shallow saline lagoons (Kear 2005a) and sheltered coastal bays and estuaries (Madge and Burn 1988). During the winter it inhabits brackish and freshwater marshes (Madge and Burn 1988), rivers, lakes, ponds (Kear 2005a) and shallow tidal estuarine areas (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a) with adjacent grasslands (del Hoyo et al. 1992), flooded pastures (Kear 2005a) or agricultural arable fields (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a) below 100 m (Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet The species is predominantly herbivorous (del Hoyo et al. 1992), its diet consisting of the seeds, fruits, leaves, roots, rhizomes and stems of aquatic plants (e.g. Potamogeton, Zostera and Glyceria spp.), grasses (del Hoyo et al. 1992), sedges, reeds (Phragmites and Typha spp. [Kear 2005a]) and herbaceous tundra vegetation (Kear 2005a). During the winter the species complements its diet with agricultural grain and vegetables (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (e.g. potatoes [del Hoyo et al. 1992] and sugar beet [Kear 2005a]), and may also take estuarine invertebrates such as molluscs, amphipods (e.g. Corophium spp.) and polycheate worms on tidal mudflats prior to migration (Kear 2005a). Breeding site The nest is a large mound of plant matter positioned on elevated ground (del Hoyo et al. 1992) such as a ridge or hummock, often at some distance from feeding pools to reduce to the risk of flooding (Kear 2005a). The species may re-use a nest from the previous year or build a new one, and although it is not colonial, many pairs may nest close together in optimum habitats (e.g. 5-16 pairs per 10 km2 [Kear 2005a]). Management information An experiment carried out in the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, California found that in wetland habitats where clay hardpans underlie wetland sediments tilling (plowing) the soil may be an effective means of reducing lead shot availability to waterfowl (Thomas et al. 2001). Plowing was found to reduce the amount of shot available to depths of 20-30 cm (below the foraging zone of the species [Thomas et al. 2001]).","The species is threatened by the degradation and loss of wetland habitats due to drainage (Kear 2005) (e.g. for agriculture [Grishanov 2006]), petroleum pollution, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (e.g. decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth), the burning and mowing of reeds (Grishanov 2006) and eutrophication (Kear 2005). The north-west European population is thought to be particularly sensitive to land-use change as well as climate change due to its narrow breeding distribution across the Russian high Arctic and its high dependency on a small number of stop-over sites during spring and autumn migration (Nagy et al. 2012). In the Far East declines have been recorded owing to decreases in submerged vegetation, possibly as a result of eutrophication and changes in hydrology brought about by dam construction (Cong et al. 2011, Carboneras and Kirwan 2016). Its Arctic breeding habitat is also threatened by oil and gas exploration (Kear 2005). The species is threatened by mortality from oil pollution (oil spills) in moulting and pre-migrational staging areas, from collisions with powerlines, and from lead poisoning as a result of lead shot (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005) and fishing weight ingestion during migration and on wintering grounds (Kear 2005). The species suffers from poaching in north-west Europe, is hunted for sport in North America (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005) and is hunted considerably for subsistence throughout its range (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","The global population is estimated to number 317,000-336,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016). The breeding population in Europe is estimated at 5,000-6,000 pairs, which equates to 10,000-12,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). National population sizes have been estimated at c.50-10,000 wintering individuals in China and c.100-10,000 breeding pairs in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Unknown,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II.

In addition, measures should be implemented to prevent the negative impacts of infrastructure and industrial development by avoiding key sites, or by mitigating any potential negative impacts in the absence of alternative locations. Where necessary, develop and implement emergency plans by companies involved in the exploitation and transportation of petrochemicals on the flyway to reduce mortality in case of accidents. Monitoring and research of population changes and demographic parameters should continue and dead bird surveillance should be expanded to cover the entire flyway of the species. Introduce compensatory payments and other site management measures and increase efforts to reduce illegal shooting (Nagy et al. 2012).",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is a lekking species. It may act as an umbrella to other sage-brush specialists when conserved.","Immense areas of its habitat have been cleared or degraded due to cultivation (for wheat, potatoes and other crops), burning and overgrazing, and the species has been extirpated from various parts of its former range (British Columbia, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizona) (Schroeder et al. 1999). Continuing development of natural gas resources is causing reduced lek attendance and overall population (Holloran and Anderson 2005). Coyote Canis latrans control is likely to have a detrimental impact on sage grouse owing to the loss of beneficial indirect interactions (Mezquida et al. 2006). In 2003, about 25% of the radio-marked sage-grouse in the Powder River Basin died from West Nile virus. That number dropped to 10% in 2004 and 2% in 2005 in response to cool summer temperatures, but the long-term impacts require further study. There have been large-scale losses of sagebrush habitat owing to changes in fire frequencies resulting from cheatgrass proliferation (Holloran in litt. 2007).","There are estimated to be c.150,000 mature individuals (Rich et al. 2004).",Decreasing,"Centrocercus urophasianus inhabits the shrubland ecosystems of south-eastern Canada (Alberta and Saskatchewan) and western USA (Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah and Colorado) (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Schroeder et al. 1999). Although the accurate estimation of trends is difficult, the range-wide breeding population was estimated as 142,000 individuals in 1998, clearly lower than historic levels (Braun 1998), and decline rates have been estimated at 50% or higher since 1966 (J.

Populations in Madagascar appear to be sedentary, but it is known to be locally migratory in East and West Africa, distributions in these areas varying highly between years according to the water regime (in Cameroon the presence of the species is related to flooding) (Scott and Rose 1996). The timing of the breeding season is largely determined by water availability (del Hoyo et al. 1992): populations north of the Zambezi River breed during months of low rainfall, while those in the south breed in the wet season (Scott and Rose 1996). This species breeds in single pairs or loose groups and remains in dispersed pairs or small groups whilst undergoing the post-breeding moult (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982). During the non-breeding season congregations of 20-30, several hundreds or even thousands may occur in feeding areas (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Hockey et al. 2005). The species is active both diurnally and nocturnally (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982), foraging mainly during the first two hours after dawn and last two hours before sunset (Hockey et al. 2005). Habitat This species inhabits shallow freshwater or brackish wetlands with tall grass (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982). Such habitats include freshwater lakes, seasonal freshwater pools, slow-flowing streams, marshy areas, swamps in open flat terrain and flooded grasslands (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Kear 2005a). It also very frequently occurs in areas of wet rice cultivation (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Kear 2005a), and seeks the cover of densely vegetated wetlands while it is vulnerable and flightless during its moulting period (Kear 2005a). Diet The species is predominantly vegetarian, feeding on aquatic seeds and fruits, bulbs, leaf shoots, buds and the structural parts of aquatic plants such as grasses and rushes, although it does occasionally take small aquatic insects (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Hockey et al. 2005). It is also shows a preference for cultivated rice grains (Hohman et al. 1996). Breeding site The nests of this species are predominantly mounds of plant material, often floating on water and well concealed amidst vegetation (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982). In India however, the species is primarily tree-nesting, utilising hollow trees and even disused stick nests of large birds such as kites or crows (Madge and Burn 1988).","This species is persecuted through hunting in many rice growing areas (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982) and there has been a marked decline in numbers due to shooting anf trapping at Lake Alaotra in Madagascar (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also often exposed to pesticides used on rice crops, is suceptible to lead poisoning, and suffers mortality through collision with powerlines (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982). The damming of the Senegal river has markedly decreased the habitat quality in that area, which may be having a negative impact on the population in that area (Triplett and Yesou 2000). Wetland habitat degradation on the east coast of India due to siltation, proliferation of invasive freshwater plant species (such as water hyacinth Eichornia crassipes), increased aquaculture activities and eutrophication may threaten the small proportion of the species that utilises the area (Nayak 2006). The species is also susceptible to avian botulism, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (van Heerden 1974). Utilisation The species is hunted for local consumption and trade from Lake Chilwa, Malawi (Bhima 2006). It is also hunted and traded at traditional medicine markets in Nigeria (Nikolaus 2001).","The population is estimated to number 1,300,000-1,500,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

In addition, Long-billed Curlew range contractions on the eastern edge of their range continue to cause concerns.","Continental populations were thought to be declining by 2% per year between 1980 and 1996 (equivalent to 16% in ten years) (AOU 1998, Hill 1998); however data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey indicate that these figures were incorrect and in fact annual declines at a rate of 0.6% between 1980 and 2006 are more realistic (Morrison et al. 2006). This equates to a decline of just 5.8% over a ten year period. However, it appears that there are considerably more Long-billed Curlews than previously thought, with a likely global population in the order of 50,000-123,000, based on recent assessments, expert opinion and statistically based surveys (Wetlands International 2006).",Decreasing,"This species was once an abundant breeder over most of the prairie regions of the USA and Canada. Populations have declined throughout this range since the beginning of the 20th century as a result of over-hunting and habitat loss (owing to fragmentation, conversion to croplands, and urban development). It is now extirpated as a breeding bird in Kansas, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, eastern Nebraska, Illinois, Manitoba and south-east Saskatchewan. It migrates to winter in the southern USA and Mexico, with birds occurring irregularly in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica (AOU 1998, Hill 1998).","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II.

94048187,22706052,Corvus hawaiiensis,Extinct in the Wild,,2016,2016-10-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The last two known wild individuals of this species disappeared in 2002, so the species is now classified as Extinct in the Wild. Some individuals remain in captive breeding facilities and a reintroduction plan is being developed.","It once inhabited dry to moist `ohi`a-koa forest and woodlands, but it later became confined to high mountain forest. It is omnivorous, but primarily feeds on the fruit of native understory plants (Maxfield 1998, USFWS and Hawai'i DLNR 1999). As well as fruits and berries, the species feeds on eggs, young birds, insects and carrion (Faike 2006). Captive-reared birds have been observed using twigs as tools to access food (Faike 2006). Nest construction usually begins in March and the first clutches are laid in April (Banko et al. 2003).","It has suffered from extensive habitat alteration, particularly reduction of understory food-plants as a result of the activities of feral ungulates, logging, agriculture and the loss of pollinators and dispersers (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Problematic ungulates include feral cattle, mouflon sheep, feral sheep and goats (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). The impact of shooting has probably been substantial, even in recent decades. In the late 19th Century, the species was persecuted as a pest, and it became unpopular with pig hunters for alerting animals to their presence (Faike 2006). The species was confiding and easily attracted by imitated calls, making it an easy target (Faike 2006). During breeding the species is sensitive to human disturbance (Faike 2006), including nest-monitoring operations (Banko et al. 2002, Walters 2006). Other documented threats include predation by introduced rats, the small Asian mongoose Herpestes javanicus and the native Hawaiian Hawk Buteo solitarius (classified as Near Threatened), as well as avian malaria and pox carried by introduced mosquitoes (Maxfield 1998) and Toxoplasma gondii carried by feral cats (Banko et al. 2002, J. Burgett in litt. 2007, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Feral cats are ubiquitous in the species's habitat and are also potential predators (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). Fledged chicks remain near the ground for several days before they can fly properly and are at particular risk from predation (Faike 2006, Banko et al. 2002). Captive-reared birds have suffered from disease, with at least one dying from a bacterial infection, and diseases may have made others more vulnerable to predation (Maxfield 1998, Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). The captive population is inbred (Faike 2006, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009), and this may be reducing reproductive success. West Nile Virus, which could potentially be introduced by migrating shorebirds and waterfowl or commercial transport, and is spread by mosquitoes (Faike 2006), could threaten reintroduction efforts in the future. West Nile Virus is presumed to be highly lethal in C. hawaiiensis, owing to a reduction in the population of the American Crow C. brachyrhynchos in mainland North America by 45% over eight years due to the virus (J. Burgett in litt. 2007).","In 1992, there were only 11 or 12 birds in the wild (Maxfield 1998, Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009), and the last two individuals were last seen in June 2002. The last known wild chick fledged in 1992, and the last viable wild egg was laid in 1996 (Faike 2006). The species persists in captive breeding facilities, with development of a reintroduction programme in progress (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Captive breeding started in the 1970s, but few fledglings were produced until eggs from wild nests were harvested and hatched in captivity during 1993-1996 (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009, Banko 2009). A total of 27 captive-reared juveniles, originating from eggs laid either in the wild or in captivity, were released during 1993-1999 (Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). By 1999, 21 released birds had died and the remaining six were captured to protect them and preserve genetic diversity (Maxfield 1998, Conrow 1999, Banko 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals (49 at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center, 44 at the Maui Bird Conservation Center, and 1 at the San Diego Zoo), including 39 birds used as breeders (Switzer 2011).","","Corvus hawaiiensis was distributed historically on Hawai`i in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), where the last individuals were found in and around the Kona Forest Unit of Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge. Bones of this or a closely related species have been found on Maui, indicating a wider distribution before Western contact (Banko et al. 2002, Banko 2009). Nesting by the last known wild birds was probably confined to higher elevations on Mauna Loa in South Kona (Faike 2006, Banko 2009).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayBetween 1993 and 2007, over 90 birds were hatched in the captive breeding programme (Lieberman and Kuehler 2009). Captive-raised individuals were released into lightly-managed habitat and monitored (Kuehler et al. 1994, Lieberman 1997, Banko 2009), but releases were stopped after January 1999 due to increasing mortality (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). About 75 birds need to be maintained in the captive flock for future reintroduction attempts to take place (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). In 2011, the captive population stood at 94 individuals, including 39 birds used as breeders (Switzer 2011). Introduced mammalian predators were trapped in the Kona Forest Unit and, although this no longer takes place, predators will be managed at any future reintroduction sites (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). Some areas of its former range are now fenced and free of feral ungulates, and the exclusion of ungulates will be extended into other areas (J. Burgett in litt. 2007). Relocation of problematic B. solitarius failed because the birds homed back from over 32 km (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Two reintroduction sites have now been identified (Nelson in litt. 2012). Following ungulate removal, fencing and habitat restoration, reintroduction at Puʻu Makaʻala Natural Area Reserve is due to begin with the release of 6 birds hatched in 2016. Ongoing restoration effort continues at the second site. A recovery plan was prepared in 1982 and revised in 2009, outlining recovery actions including expanding the captive propagation to minimize loss of genetic diversity, protecting suitable habitat and managing threats to the species, establishing new populations in managed habitat, establishing a program to increase public support, and continuing research and adaptive management practices for species recovery (USFWS 2009). Each year, around 2,000 school children and students attend the environmental education programme and see C. hawaiiensis in captivity at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Centre (Faike 2006).Conservation Actions ProposedRestore and manage a significant proportion of remaining habitat within the species's historical range. Deal creatively with the problem posed by B. solitarius (Maxfield 1998, P. Baker in litt. 1999, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). Develop captive breeding programmes and reintroduce birds to habitat managed to reduce major threats. Exclude ungulates from more areas of habitat.

It may have been driven extinct by disease spread by introduced mosquitoes. However, it cannot yet be presumed to be Extinct until all areas of remaining habitat have been thoroughly searched. Any remaining population is likely to be tiny, and for these reasons it is treated as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct).","In the 1890s, it was reported to eat quantities of carabid beetles, most likely wood-borers, as it was seen feeding on the dead branches of koa trees (Berger 1972). Recent sightings have been between 300 and 650 m in remnant native, lowland mesic to wet forest (Baker and Baker 2000). One nest with two eggs was collected in late January 1901 (Berger 1972).","Some native forests remain on O`ahu, so habitat loss and alteration cannot fully explain the decline of this species (VanderWerf et al. 1997). Disease spread by introduced mosquitoes is prevalent in the lowlands (Lindsey et al. 1998) and is a likely contributory factor. Circumstantial evidence links declines of some native birds on O`ahu with the spread of introduced birds, but there is no direct evidence for their impact (Scott et al. 1986, VanderWerf et al. 1997) and, as this species probably feeds primarily on wood-boring insects, introduced birds are unlikely to be significant competitors. The construction of the H-3 freeway (for which the US Congress gave specific exemption from the Endangered Species Act) destroyed habitat around North Halawa Valley, from which some of the most recent confirmed sightings have come (Pratt 1993, J. Lepson in litt. 1999).","Any remaining population is assumed to be tiny (numbering fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals), with the last probable sighting in 1985, despite recent searches for the species.",Unknown,"Paroreomyza maculata is endemic to O`ahu in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), where fossil evidence indicates that it once occurred in the lowlands (Olson and James 1982). In the past few decades, there have only been a few confirmed sightings, with several of these from the area around North Halawa Valley, Ko`olau range (Pratt 1993). However, many recent records are viewed with doubt because of its close similarity with Hemignathus flavus. The last well-documented observation was of two birds on 12 December 1985 on Poamoho Trail during the Waipi`o Christmas Bird Count (Bremer 1986); the last specimen was taken in 1968 and some consider this the last definitive record (Roberts et al. 2010). There have been several reports from different areas since, but details of the observations have been inconclusive and the birds were never relocated. However, it cannot yet be presumed to be Extinct until further surveys have confirmed that there is no reasonable doubt that the last individual has died. If any population remains, it is likely to be tiny.","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwaySurveys have been carried out during the 1990s to search for this species, but have failed to find any birds (Pratt 1994).

Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to conduct intensive and extensive surveys to locate any remaining populations (Baker and Baker 2000), following similar methods to the Hawaii Rare Bird Search (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). If any birds are found, start intensive monitoring, including the collection of data on vocalisations, foraging and breeding behaviour (Baker and Baker 2000).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is predominantly sedentary or locally dispersive, but makes partially or fully migratory movements in the northern parts of its range due to its vulnerability to freezing conditions (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Most northern populations move south from September to December, returning again from March to May (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species breeds in solitary territorial pairs during the spring, especially during wet months (the exact timing varying geographically) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It remains largely solitary throughout the year although juveniles and adults may form diurnal feeding groups of up to 30 individuals in the winter, especially during hard weather (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), often congregating on sheltered lakes and ponds (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat The species inhabits freshwater wetlands, both still and moving, requiring easy access to open water (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and showing a preference for waters sheltered by woodland, bushes or tall emergent vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Suitable habitats include slow-flowing rivers (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), oxbow lakes (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), streams, canals, ditches, lakes, reservoirs, sites with small open water surfaces such as pools and ponds only a few metres across, swamps, marshes (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), seasonally flooded sites (del Hoyo et al. 1996) such as flood-plains (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), disused gravel pits, rice-fields (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), sewage ponds (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), and occasionally mangroves (Puerto Rico). It generally avoids very open sites (especially those exposed to wind or wave action) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998) and oligotrophic or saline habitats (although it may be found on brackish waters) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). When foraging the species may range onto drier grassland, agricultural land or meadows, and on migration and in the winter months it can often be observed on damp grassland away from water (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Diet The species is omnivorous and opportunistic, its diet consisting of earthworms, crustaceans, molluscs, adult and larval insects (especially flies, mayflies, caddisflies, bugs, beetles and Lepidoptera), spiders, small fish, tadpoles and occasionally birds eggs, as well as plant matter such as filamentous algae, moss, the vegetative parts of reeds and aquatic plants, the seeds of reeds, rushes, sedges, water-lilies, waterside herbaceous vegetation, trees (Ulmus spp.) and cereal crops, flowers of Eichhornia spp., and the berries and fruits of yew, Rubus, Sorbus, Rosa, Crataegus, Rhamnus, Hedera, Sambucus, Hippophae spp. and various orchard trees (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest varies between a shallow saucer and a deep cup constructed from twigs and waterside vegetation, and can be floating on or positioned up to 1 m above water in emergent vegetation, or positioned on a solid platform of branches in water. Less often the nest is placed in ground vegetation or in low bushes on the bank near water, or in bushes and trees up to 8 m from the ground (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Management information Early harvesting in rice-fields should be avoided as it harms nests and young broods of this species (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).","","The global population is estimated to number over 2,000,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2014).",Stable,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Egg-laying occurs from late April to early August in Russia, and late May to August in Japan. Clutch size is varied, with larger clutches in Russia (nine to ten) than in Japan (five to eight). The female is the sole incubator of the eggs (del Hoyo et al. 1994).

Northern Palearctic populations are mostly found in taiga forests of spruce (Picea) and southern breeders (southern Britain south to the Mediterranean region) in pines (Pinus), including Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Race guillemardi occupies black pine (Pinus nigra) and race corsicana occurs in cultivated Corsican pine (P.n. larico). It also uses larch (Larix), cedar (Cedrus), alder (Alnus) and birch (Betula). In North America it also uses hemlock (Tsuga) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga). In North Africa it breeds mostly in Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), less commonly in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), almond (Prunus dulcis), walnut (Juglans), poplar (Populus), hornbeam (Carpinus), beech (Fagus), oak (Quercus) and hazel (Corylus). In the Himalayas it is mostly found in high-altitude hemlocks, spruce, fir (Abies) and pine forests. On passage and in the non-breeding season it occurs in pine and deciduous trees in coastal woodlands, parks and gardens, including in suburban areas and city centres, also exceptionally along tideline. The breeding season is generally determined by food abundance but is typically from August to April/May in northern and central Europe, mid-January to mid-May in Scandinavia, February to mid-May in northern Russia, March to early November in Cyprus and December-January in the Philippines. It breeds at any time of year in the Indian Subcontinent and in most months in North America. The nest is a deep cup of conifer twigs, bark or rotting wood strips, plant fibres, grass, moss, lichens, animal hair and feathers. It is sited 3–35 m above the ground, usually beneath the outermost foliage, close to the crown of a tall conifer and often close to the trunk in a spruce or along the branch of a pine. Clutches are three to four eggs. The species is resident and a partial migrant and is commonly irruptive and nomadic in the non-breeding season (Clement and Christie 2016).","In Finland, the species has declined due to forest fragmentation. This is principally as a result of overall shortening of rotation times leading to a reduction in the average age of forests. In Canada and the USA, increased logging of old-growth habitats may depress populations because conifers produce their largest cone crops after about 60 years of age. The population in Newfoundland has undergone a steady decline over the last 50 years possibly owing to competition for cone crops from introduced American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and accelerated logging of old-growth woods (Clement and Christie 2016).","Rich et al.

It is also found in more lowland watercourses, even canals, where there are artificial waterfalls, weirs, millraces or lock gates. Outside of the breeding season it occupies a wider variety of habitats, including farmyards, sewage farms, forest tracks, tea estates and even town centres (Tyler 2016). The breeding season is from the end of March to August. It is monogamous and both sexes build the nest which is a typical platform and cup of coarser material, lined with finer grasses, root fibres and often horse hair. It is generally sited on a rock ledge, in a crevice in a riverbank, or often on a ledge in a wall, under a bridge or in a drainpipe. Clutches can be from three to seven eggs. It feeds mainly on insects but also takes freshwater shrimps (Gammarus), terrestrial snails (Mollusca) and spiders (Araneae).

The lapponica subspecies which breeds and winters within Europe is thought to be experiencing an increase in the wintering population but the breeding trend is unknown. Of the taymyrensis subspecies which breeds in Siberia, the population wintering in west and south-west Africa is estimated to be declining whilst the trend for the population wintering in south and south-west Asia and east Africa is not known. Two subspecies, menzbieri and baueri, use the East Asian-Australasian Flyway and are both undergoing extremely rapid declines, probably owing to severe habitat loss in the Yellow Sea. As a result of severe declines in populations using the East Asian-Australasian Flyway the species has been uplisted to Near Threatened; it almost meets the requirements for listing as threatened under criteria A2abc+3bc+4abc.","The species breeds in marshy, swampy areas in lowland moss and shrub tundra (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996) near wet river valleys (Johnsgard 1981), lakes and sedge bogs (Flint et al. 1984), as well as on swampy heathlands in the willow and birch zone near the Arctic treeline (Johnsgard 1981), in open larch Larix spp. woodland close to water (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and occasionally on open bogs in the extreme north of the coniferous forest zone (Johnsgard 1981). The nest is a depression positioned on a dry elevated site (del Hoyo et al. 1996) such as a tundra ridge (Johnsgard 1981) or hummock (Flint et al.1984), often between clumps of grass (del Hoyo et al. 1996) or under a thicket (Flint et al. 1984). On passage the species may frequent inland wetlands (Hayman et al. 1986), sandy beaches with pine Pinus spp. stands, swampy lowlands near lakes (Flint et al. 1984) and short-grass meadows, but during the winter it is more common in intertidal areas along muddy coastlines, estuaries, inlets, mangrove-fringed lagoons and sheltered bays (del Hoyo et al. 1996) with tidal mudflats or sandbars (Johnsgard 1981).When breeding the species feeds on insects, annelid worms, molluscs and occasionally seeds and berries (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In intertidal areas the species's diet consists of annelids (e.g. Nereis spp. and Arenicola spp.), bivalves and crustaceans, although it will also take cranefly larvae and earthworms on grasslands and occasionally larval amphibians (tadpoles) and small fish (del Hoyo et al. 1996). This species is a full long-distance migrant, with satellite data showing western Alaskan individuals can travel &gt;11,000 km. to New Zealand without stopping (Gill et al. 2009).","Threats on the breeding grounds include oil and gas exploration and associated infrastructure development, legal subsistence harvesting and illegal hunting, and increases in predator numbers (Brown et al. 2014). Climate change has the potential to affect vegetation and the extent of suitable breeding habitat (P. Battley in litt. 2016).The species is threatened by the degradation of stopover and non-breeding sites due to land reclamation, shellfisheries, pollution, human disturbance, reduced river flows, and in some areas the invasion of mudflats and coastal saltmarshes by mangroves (owing to sea-level rise and increased sedimentation and nutrient loads at the coast from uncontrolled development and soil erosion in upstream catchment areas) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Kelin and Qiang 2006, Straw and Saintilan 2006, Melville et al. 2016). Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of wetland areas at non-breeding sites can also cause cyanobacterium blooms that may impact this species's prey species (Estrella et al. 2011).Loss of intertidal stopover habitats due to reclamation activities in the Yellow Sea region of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is thought to be driving declines in shorebird populations (Amano et al. 2010, Yang et al. 2011, Leyrer et al. 2014, Choi et al. 2015, Melville et al. 2016, Piersma et al. 2016). It is estimated that up to 65% of tidal flats in the Yellow Sea region have been lost over the past five decades, with an annual loss of 1.2% per year since the 1980s (Murray et al. 2014), and the Republic of Korea having lost 75% of its mudflats by 2010 (Moores et al. 2016). These losses are attributed to urban, industrial and agricultural expansion within the region.Development elsewhere in the species's range is also considered a threat to important habitat: potential oil and gas extraction activities and commercial and industrial development threaten staging and non-breeding grounds in West Africa, the Middle East and the Wadden Sea, while rapid residential, commercial and industrial development in West Africa and the Middle East threatens staging and wintering grounds (Leyrer et al. 2014). Although not currently detected in certain populations (e.g. in Australia [Curran et al. 2014]), the species has also been susceptible to avian influenza in the past so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). This species may be hunted in some range states, with anecdotal evidence from individuals carrying transmitters being shot (P. Battley in litt. 2016, J. Szabo in litt. 2016).","The global population is estimated to number c. 1,099,000-1,149,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2017). The European breeding population is estimated at 3,700-9,000 pairs, which equates to 7,400-18,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). The East Asian-Australasian Flyway population has been estimated at 325,000 individuals (Hansen et al. 2016).",Decreasing,"The species breeds across the Arctic from northern Europe through Siberia to Alaska (U.S.A.), wintering along the coasts of western Europe, Africa, the Middle East, south- and south-east Asia, Australia and New Zealand.

Incorporate requirements for this species into planning of coastal development (Threatened Species Scientific committee 2016). Legally protect the species in all range states (Leyrer et al. 2014).Sustainable fisheries in the Wadden Sea and other important European estuaries should be promoted. Continue to monitor the species and expand schemes to provide reliable population estimates. Conduct research to improve knowledge of threats. Particular focus should be given to the impact of pollutants, disturbance and hunting, increasing Red Fox Vulpes vulpes abundance, changes in lemming population cycles and the northward encroachment of scrub habitat (Brown et al. 2014, Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2016).

The nest is built by both sexes although the female does the majority of construction. It is made from sticks and twigs, with a side entrance protected by thorny twigs. A deep cup is thickly lined with soft materials such as wool, animal fur, soft grasses and feathers, usually placed at variable height in crown of tall tree; normally a fresh nest built each year, although in some cases an old nest may be repaired. It is omnivorous but principally a carnivorous scavenger. The diet varies according to local habitats, but generally consists of invertebrates, small mammals and lizards, frogs, bird eggs and nestlings, as well as carrion.

Overall, the global population is estimated to be declining at such a rate that the species qualifies as Near Threatened.","Behaviour This species is highly gregarious and migrates on a broad front, making long-distance flights often overland between relatively few staging and wintering areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It breeds from April to mid-June in loose, semi-colonial groups of up to 3 pairs per ha (Gunnarsson et al. 2006). Non-breeding birds remain in flocks, often near to the breeding colonies. As soon as the young fledge, breeding birds begin to congregate in loose flocks which can be many thousands strong (Cramp et al. 1983, J. Gill in litt. 2016). The species migrates southwards between late-June and October. During the autumn migration it may roost in flocks of tens of thousands at favoured sites (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and this is the main moulting period for adult birds. The islandica subspecies moults in northwest Europe, while western populations of the nominate subspecies often moult in north Morrocco (J. Gill in litt. 2016), and many adults pause in north Morocco in July to moult. Huge flocks occur at some wintering sites, particularly in the floodplains of Lake Chad. The return passage occurs between February and April (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and birds arrive at the breeding grounds in groups of 5-30 individuals (Johnsgard 1981). Many one-year-old birds remain in the wintering range during the summer. During the winter and migration the species usually forages gregariously (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding In its breeding range it mostly inhabits areas with high but not dense grass and soft soil (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Johnsgard 1981, Schekkerman and Beintema 2007, Tomkovich and Lebedeva 1998), occasionally using sandy areas; although other information suggests it may prefer short vegetation (Laursen and Hald 2012). Its preferred habitats include cattle pastures, hayfields (Johnsgard 1981), lowland wet grasslands, grassy marshland, raised bogs and moorland, lake margins and damp grassy depressions in steppes (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Subspecies islandica shows a distinct preference for large patches of dwarf-birch bog and marsh, particularly with abundant sedge-pools (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Gunnarsson et al. 2006). Extensive farmland habitats are of critical importance for breeding Western European populations (del Hoyo et al. 1996), with young, that grow up in herb-rich meadows recruiting to the breeding population 2.5 times better than young that grow up in monocultures (Kentie et al. 2013). In intensively managed grasslands small shallow pools attract breeding godwits and, in combination with herb rich meadows, may improve breeding succes (Weterings et al. 2015). After the young have fledged, adults and fledglings often move to secondary habitat which more closely resembles that of their non-breeding range, including wet damp areas around fish-ponds and sewage farms, tidal marshes, mud flats and salt-water lagoons (Cramp et al. 1983, Tucker and Heath 1994). Non-breeding Subspecies limosa tends to winter in freshwater habitats, including swampy lake shores, pools, flooded grassland and irrigated rice fields. Subspecies islandica and melanuroides, however, often winter in saline habitats (del Hoyo et al. 1996) such as sheltered estuaries and lagoons with large intertidal mudflats (Johnsgard 1981), sandy beaches, salt-marshes and salt-flats (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Despite these general differences there is considerable overlap in wintering habitat between sympatric populations of subspecies limosa and islandica (Alves et al. 2010, Lopes et al. 2013).  Seasonally-flooded grassland is a critical habitat for the birds wintering in Ireland (Hayhow 2008). Birds on passage in Iberia make much use of rice fields (Lourenço et al. 2010). Diet Its diet consists of adult and larval insects (especially beetles), annelid and polychaete worms, molluscs, ragworms, crustaceans, spiders, fish eggs, and the spawn and tadpoles of frogs (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). On the breeding grounds grasshoppers and other orthopterans are often prevalent in the diet (Johnsgard 1981). Particularly during the winter and on migration it will also take plant material including berries, seeds and rice grains (Cramp et al. 1983, Lourenço et al. 2010). On its wintering grounds in Portugal, the bivalve Scrobicularia plana has been found to represent its primary food source (Moreira 1994), while in the salinas of Spain, it mainly feeds on chironomid larvae (Estrella and Masero 2010). Breeding site The nest is placed on the ground in short, often luxurious vegetation (Johnsgard 1981, Cramp et al. 1983, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It consists of a shallow scrape 12-15cm in diameter, lined with a thick mat of stem grass, leaves and other available vegetation (Cramp et al. 1983). Breeding birds show a high degree of nest site fidelity (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and some degree of natal philopatry (Kruk et al. 1998) which is more pronounced among males (Gunnarsson et al. 2011).","Loss of nesting habitat owing to wetland drainage and agricultural intensification, and conversely abandonment in some parts of the range, are the most significant threats (Mischenko 2008, Kentie et al. 2013). Detrimental activities include the conversion of wet meadows to arable land and loss of habitat to development (Tucker and Heath 1994), increased fertilisation and drainage of grassland (Roodbergen and Teunissen 2014), earlier and more frequent cutting as farmers adapt to climate change (Kleijn et al. 2010), spring burning and scrub encroachment (A. Mischenko in litt. 2007) and possibly disturbance by walkers (Holm and Laursen 2009). Increasing populations of predators to possibly unnatural levels is a significant cause of egg and chick mortality in the Netherlands, exacerbated by intensive farming reducing available cover for the species (Schekkerman et al. 2009, Kentie et al. 2015). On intensively grazed pastures, trampling is a major cause of nest loss, and a switch to monoculture on arable land reduces the supply of insects on which the species feeds (Kentie et al. 2013). In some areas, grassland turnover from 'natural, flower-rich, diverse and wet' to silage monoculture leads to a loss of nests with eggs and chicks due to mowing and starvation of chicks due to a lack of food (Schekkerman and Beintema 2007). A study in the central regions of European Russia suggests that significant decline in spring flood levels during two last decades, as a result climate change, has strengthened the negative impact of agricultural abandonment (A. Mischenko in litt. 2016). Habitat fragmentation may cause problems for this species, which nests in dispersed colonies and sub-colonies as protection against predators hence productivity may be low in such areas. Indeed, sink locations have been documented for the species, where birds recruited from good quality habitat disperse to low quality habitats (often suffering high predation) effectively losing these individuals to the population. This has repercussions for the effectiveness of agri-environment measures (Kentie et al. 2015, Leigh et al. 2016). There is a marked decrease in the density of breeding birds near to roads, particularly those with heavy traffic (van der Zande et al. 1980, Reijnen et al. 1996). Natal philopatry means that a decrease in local recruitment could prove catastrophic for individual breeding sites (Kruk et al. 1998). The Icelandic population is potentially at risk from the policy of the Icelandic government to encourage afforestion of the lowland habitats where they breed and from ongoing agricultural expansion (Gunnarsson et al. 2006, Gill et al. 2007), although this population has been increasing strongly over recent decades (BirdLife International 2015).Threats on migration include pollution, human disturbance, habitat reclamation for tidal energy plants, aquaculture ponds, land conversion for agriculture, urban expansion and agricultural intensification at rice paddies. The proposed development of a new airport near Lisbon is likely to have negative implications on an important site for migratory birds (Gill et al. 2007, Masero et al. 2011). Hunting has been another significant threat, although France has now followed the rest of the European Union (EU) in implementing a five-year ban on hunting of the species, beginning in 2008 (I. Burfield in litt. 2008), which was extended in 2013 for a further five years. Outside the EU, for example on the African wintering grounds, hunting is known to occur but its scale and impact is unknown. Water pollution is probably an issue in parts of the species range (H. Hötker in litt. 2005), although the effects of the release of some pollutants, like untreated sewage, on this species may be minor as long as there are several alternative prey present at a site (Alves et al. 2012). In Egypt there are plans to increase the depth of the sailing channel of the Nile, impacting upon this species's habitat there (H. Ibrahim in litt. 2016). Drought in the West African wintering quarters may have had negative impacts on the mainland European population (Tucker and Heath 1994) in conjunction with the extensive drainage of wetlands in this area, for energy production, water storage and agriculture (Gill et al. 2007). Invasive plants may also degrade wintering habitat in Australia (Garnett et al. 2011). Studies of islandica godwits have shown that individuals breeding in the habitats where productivity is higher also winter in the areas where survival is higher (Gunnarsson et al. 2005), therefore maintaining high quality wintering sites is crucial to raising productivity on breeding grounds. ","The global population is estimated at 614,000-809,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016). The population is estimated to number 102,000-149,000 pairs in Europe (including 25,000 pairs in Iceland) (BirdLife International 2015); 25,000-100,000 in west-central Asia; 150,000 in central Asia and Siberia (Asian Waterbird Census unpublished data); 160,000 in the rest of Asia and Australia.",Decreasing,"This species has a large discontinuous breeding range extending from Iceland to the Russian far east, with wintering populations in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Australasia (Van Gils et al. 2017). It occurs as three subspecies, L. l. islandica, L. l. limosa, and L. l. melanuroides. Subspecies islandica breeds predominantly in Iceland, with much smaller numbers in the Faeroe Islands, Shetland (United Kingdom) and the Lofoten Islands (Norway). This subspecies winters in roughly similar numbers in the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Portugal, with small numbers in the Netherlands (J. Gill in litt. 2016). Subspecies limosa breeds across a wide area extending from Western Europe and central Europe to central Asia and Asiatic Russia, as far east as the River Yenisey. The west European population of this subspecies migrates south through France and Iberia to winter largely in West Africa, while eastern breeding birds winter in southeast Europe to the Middle East, and may also be the origin of wintering birds in Mali, Chad and northern Cameroon (Gill et al. 2007, Oomen 2008, Lourenço &amp; Piersma 2008b). Subspecies melanuroides breeds in disjunct populations in Mongolia, northern China, Siberia (Russia) and the Russian Far East. These birds migrates across a broad front to winter from western South Asia to Australia, encompassing India, Indochina, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Melanesia (Dutson 2011, Van Gils et al. 2017). The global population is estimated at 614,000-809,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016). Population trends vary across the range. There have been large and well-documented declines in the mainland European breeding population (of the nominate subspecies) of between 50-60% (BirdLife International 2015). For example, in the Netherlands the population decreased dramatically from 120,000-135,000 pairs in 1969 and 85,000-100,000 pairs in 1989-1991, to just 46,000-62,000 in 2009 (Tucker and Heath 1994,  BirdLife International 2004a, EU Technical Report 19 2007, Oomen 2008, Höglund et al. 2009), 35,200-59,800 pairs in 2008-2011 (BirdLife International 2015), and potentially to 33,000 pairs in 2015 (Kentie et al. 2016). In certain areas though, the breeding population has recently stabilised as a result of agri-environmental measures (Oosterveld et al. 2016). These declines are mirrored in the information from West African wintering areas, with notable declines in Senegal and Morocco, while further east (Mali, Chad and north Cameroon) wintering numbers appear stable, though data is sparser (Lourenço and Piersma 2008b). This is true also for the central Asian breeding population, which is thought to be stable of fluctuating (L. Belyalova in litt. 2005), but for which there is little recent data. In the eastern flyway, declines have been estimated at between 20-30% over three generations on the species Australian wintering grounds (Garnett et al. 2010), which hold c. 50% of the wintering population of L. l. melanuroides (Watkins 1993). The population of L. l. ilsandica, in contrast, has be increasing dramatically over the past few decades, although this increase may be levelling out and the subpopulation represents a relatively small part of the global population (Gill et al. 2007, Wetlands International in press). A recent analysis based on published literature, survey data and expert opinions from throughout the species range suggests that, overall, the global population may have declined at a mean rate of approximately 23% over 25 years leading up to 2015 (I. Burfield in litt. 2017).","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex II. An EU management plan for 2007-2009 was adopted, and an AEWA action plan replaced it at the end of 2008 (Anon. 2008). Intensive management of breeding habitat has been carried out in some Western European countries (H. Hötker in litt. 2005), and a number of agri-environment schemes focus on this species, although results have been mixed (Musters et al. 2001, S. Nagy in litt. 2005, A. Mischenko in litt. 2007, Verhulst et al. 2007). A number of significant wintering areas are protected areas, as are several breeding sites in the UK and the Netherlands. Conservation Actions ProposedObtain more quantitative data on status, population trends and conservation requirements outside Europe. Carry out research on survival, recruitment, breeding and migration (Gill et al. 2007). Critically evaluate the effectiveness of current conservation action. In the EU, use a mixture of agri-environment schemes, direct payments to wader-friendly farmers (Musters et al. 2001) and large reserves to secure protection and appropriate management of breeding habitat. The coverage of agri-environment schemes in Europe should be increased (Kleijn et al. 2010) and increases in groundwater depth should be prioritised as an outcome (Verhulst et al. 2007). New nature reserves should be established on important sites throughout the species range, and there should be attempts to get greater coverage of key areas for this species within in the Special Protection Areas network (van der Vliet et al. 2015). Manage existing reserves appropriately: prescriptions include avoiding drainage of existing wet meadows, raising water tables where necessary, low-level use of organic fertiliser, low intensity grazing, late mowing, and prevention of succession to bushy vegetation. Winter flooding is sometimes recommended but may reduce numbers of invertebrate prey (Gunnarsson et al. 2005). On intensively farmed land, maintenance of unfertilised field margins has been shown to have positive effects (Oosterveld et al. 2009). Investigate the potential for using a 'headstarting' approach to increase survival to fledging (J. Gill in litt. 2016). Prevent afforestation of lowland breeding habitat in Iceland. Prevent a loss of key breeding areas due to abandonment of grasslands and meadows in east Europe and Russian Far East. Monitor human disturbance as a threat. Ensure that migratory staging posts and winter feeding habitats and roosts are conserved and monitored, and knowledge of them is improved (Estrella and Masero 2010). Designate a special protection area at Extremadura's rice fields, which is a key stopover site (Masero et al. 2011). Manage artificial habitats appropriately, e.g. maintain low water levels in salinas such that they are available to foraging godwits (Estrella and Masero 2010), and block drainage to retain water in Iberian rice fields (Lourenço and Piersma 2008a). Protect important Yellow Sea tidal flats in China and South Korea. Engage with governments and local people throughout its migration routes. Effectively enforce the EU-wide ban on hunting until there is clear evidence that the population has returned to a favourable conservation status. Safeguard habitats in West Africa and Iberia, perhaps by offering support to rice producers (Gill et al. 2007). Collaborate with farmers and hunters, carrying out environmental education and outreach work where appropriate. Restore wetland sites in Australia (Garnett et al. 2011). Ensure recognition as a protected animal throughout range (Hancock 2008).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The species breeds from May to early-June (Richards 1990) in monospecific colonies of 10-100 pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996). After breeding it departs for the wintering grounds from late-July to September, returning again between April and May (Richards 1990). The species sometimes forages singly, but is more common in small groups or larger mixed-species flocks on passage and in the winter (Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat The species utilises a variety of wetland habitats but shows a preference for freshwater marshlands with scattered pools, particularly where the surrounding vegetation is grazed by cattle or horses (Richards 1990). It frequents inland lakes, rivers, marshes, temporary pans (e.g. in Africa), artificial fish-ponds and drainage-ponds covered with water-lilies (e.g. in Italy) (del Hoyo et al. 1996), swamps, river pools, reservoirs, large dams, sewage-ponds, flooded saltmarshes, arable fields (e.g. in Australia) (Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo et al. 1996) and rice-fields (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In Australia the species also occurs along the coast on estuaries, coastal lagoons, creeks in mangrove swamps (Snow and Perrins 1998) and tidal mudflats (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Its diet consists of terrestrial and aquatic insects (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (e.g. Dytiscidae, adult and larval Odonata, Orthoptera, flying ants (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and mosquitoes (Richards 1990)), spiders, frogs, tadpoles, small crabs (del Hoyo et al. 1996), shrimps (Richards 1990) and small fish (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a heap of aquatic vegetation (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996) or dry grass (del Hoyo et al. 1996), placed either on floating and emergent vegetation over water 60-80 cm deep or resting on the bottom of very shallow water (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species nests in colonies, neighbouring pairs spaced between 1 and 5 m apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and may forage up to 9 km away from breeding sites (more usually within 1 km) (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","The species suffers nest destruction from the invasive rodent species Myocastor coypus in Italy (Arduin 1997). Within its European range it suffers from the loss of natural wetlands to land reclamation, dry seasons and an increase in drainage schemes (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), as well as the canalization of rivers (Tucker and Heath 1994). Additionally the following threats have been identified within its European range: increasing tourism and water sports near breeding colonies result in disturbance and the loss of nesting sites (Tucker and Heath 1994) and many nests are lost to adverse weather. It is affected by water quality and so pollution from insecticides and eutrophication are a threat (Martí and Moral 2004); In addition the intensification of fisheries and bycatch in fishing nets are issues (Golemansky 2011). Utilisation Large numbers of eggs are collected for sale and local consumption in India (this may be causing population declines in some areas) (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and fishermen collect eggs in Ukraine (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","The global population is estimated to number c.300,000-1,500,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 66,300-108,000 pairs, which equates to 133,000-215,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

It avoids damper vegetation and higher mountains (Winkler et al. 2015). It is territorial and partners display by head-swinging with ruffled head feathers. Laying occurs from May to June. The nest-site is selected by both sexes and is usually in a natural cavity, an old hole of another woodpecker, or an artificial nestbox. Typically seven to twelve eggs are laid (Winkler et al. 2015). It feeds mostly on the larvae and pupae of ants. In northern areas or during bad weather insects, spiders, even tadpoles and berries may be fed to young (Tucker and Heath 1994). Across most of its range, it is fully migratory with breeding birds from Europe and western Asia wintering in western, central and eastern Africa and eastern populations wintering in the northern and central Indian Subcontinent and south-east Asia (Winkler et al. 2015).","Declines have been attributed to climatic changes, resulting in increased rainfall during the breeding season (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Winkler et al. 2015). Since the 1950s, the loss of important such as orchards and unimproved meadows and the replacement of hardwoods with conifers have also caused declines and the conversion of many areas to agriculture combined with an increase in the use of pesticides have also decreased the abundance of ants (Winkler et al. 2015).","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number 674,000-1,600,000 pairs, which equates to 1,350,000-3,200,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

It leaves its breeding grounds in late summer (September) to arrive in its wintering grounds across Europe and Asia in October and November (Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005b). Populations leave their winter quarters again between March and April, and arrive in their breeding grounds in northern Russia during the second half of May (Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005b). Both the males and females of the species undergo a flightless moult period after breeding and whilst still in their breeding range, during which they congregate at moult gatherings (Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005b) (males moult their flight feathers between late May and July, females between late June and early September) (Scott and Rose 1996). Birds of this species are dispersive during the breeding season and nest in pairs or small groups (Brown et al. 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005b). On passage to their wintering grounds individuals come together in large numbers, and during the non-breeding season the species is highly gregarious, forming close aggregations (4,200 birds were recorded in one wintering flock in Ethiopia) (Brown et al. 1982, Madge and Burn 1988). It is chiefly a diurnal feeder (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979), but is sometimes nocturnal (depending on local disturbances and tides, especially in its non-breeding marine habitats) (Kear 2005b). Habitat Breeding This species breeds in lowland freshwater marshes, slow-flowing large rivers (Kretchmar 1994) and shallow lakes and lagoons with ample submerged, floating and emerging vegetation (Kear 2005b). Ideal wetland habitats for this species are those surrounded by sparse open forest, woodland and especially agricultural land (Kretchmar 1994, Kear 2005b), in the boreal and subarctic zone (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Kear 2005b). It avoids tundra, densely forested and mountainous country, as well as fast flowing rivers and streams, but tolerates saline or alkaline steppe lakes and wetlands (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988). Non-breeding In the non-breeding season this species shows a preference for coastal salt-marshes, freshwater, brackish and saline lagoons (Cramp and Simmons 1977), flooded grasslands (Cramp and Simmons 1977), estuaries, intertidal mudflats (Cramp and Simmons 1977), and other sheltered marine habitats (Kear 2005b). Diet It is vegetarian and consumes the leaves, seeds, stems and root bulbs of pond weeds, fine grasses (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979) (especially from agricultural land surrounding lakes) (Jacobsen 1993), horsetails (Kretchmar 1994) and eelgrass, as well as algae (Johnsgard 1978). Animal material is taken rarely and usually incidentally along with vegetation or seeds (Myrfyn and Thomas 1979, Kear 2005b). Breeding site The nests of this species are shallow depressions in the ground lined with vegetation, usually positioned not far from water and well concealed under overhanging vegetation, in grass tussocks, scrub (Kear 2005b), and especially in heather (Jacobsen and Ugelvik 1998).","This species is susceptible to disturbance from freshwater recreational activities (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Grishanov 2006) (e.g. tourists walking) (Mathers et al. 2000), pollution (including thallium contamination [Mochizuki, et al. 2005], petroleum pollution [Grishanov 2006]), wetland drainage (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Grishanov 2006), peat-extraction (e.g. in the Kaliningrad region of Russia) (Grishanov 2006), changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) (Grishanov 2006) and the burning and mowing of reeds (Grishanov 2006). Avian influenza virus (strain H5N1) is also a potential threat (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Jonassen and Handeland 2007), as is poisoning from the ingestion of lead shot pellets (Mondain-Monval et al. 2002). Utilisation This species is hunted for sport (e.g. in the UK) (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005b), and although population numbers in an area decrease significantly after a period of shooting, there is no current evidence that such utilisation poses and immediate threat to the species (Vaananen 2001, Bregnballe et al. 2006).

It generally occupies more open habitat in the south and north portions of range where cliffs, sparse trees and human structures provide nest locations. In middle latitudes it is generally found in coniferous and broadleaf forests, where tree-nesting often more common than cliff-nesting. It is abundant in temperate (coniferous) rainforest along the north Pacific coast of North America. It generally avoids large cities but is abundant in Anchorage, Alaska and locally abundant in California metropolitan areas (Marzluff 2009). Egg-laying begins in late February over most of its range, although further north in Greenland and Siberia it begins later in April (Madge and Burn 1993). The nest is a large and bulky platform, made from dead sticks, lined with fine roots, grass, string and other bits of rubbish, and with mammal fur to make an inner cup. It is placed in the stout, lower branches of a tree, on a steep cliff, or on an artificial structure such as a utility pole, building, sign, radio tower, abandoned vehicle, oil derrick, bridge, irrigation pipe or windmill. Clutch size is typically four to six eggs. It is an opportunistic scavenger, consuming a huge variety of animals and plants. It preys on adult and nestling birds, eggs, small mammals, sick and dying larger mammals, toads, snakes, juvenile turtles, fish and invertebrates. It also scavenges garbage and slaughterhouse offal, dung, and nearly any kind of carrion and some plant matter is also consumed (Marzluff 2009). The species is mostly sedentary but northern populations are liable to move south in winter (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","From mid-1600s to mid-1900s or later this species was widely persecuted due to fear and superstition, resulting in European populations being reduced, often to point of creating gaps in the species's distribution (e.g. throughout much northern and central Europe). Persecution still continues in Iceland and Greenland but throughout the rest of Europe it is much reduced, allowing the species to recolonize areas it was previously extirpated from. Increasing populations of this species in much of western U.S.A. have led to conflict and targeted killing campaigns with large numbers shot and poisoned in California, Oregon, Utah and Nevada with limited and short-term benefits to crops and other wildlife (Marzluff 2009). Currently, intensive farming, the removal of woodland and human disturbance may also affect the species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","The global population is estimated to number &gt; c.16,000,000 individuals (Rich et al. 2004).

It is rarely found in areas of high shrubs or below the tree line. During winter it lives in less snowy regions or uses windswept ridges and slopes due to its dependence on ground vegetation for food. Laying is generally in June, however birds in Scotland lay from late May and those in Spitsbergen from mid-June (de Juana et al. 2016). It typically lays five to eight eggs but sometimes up to twelve (Madge and McGowan 2002). The nest is a shallow depression lined with plant material and some feathers, usually in the open and sheltered by a large stone or shrub. In winter it takes food from the ground, mainly buds and twigs of species including Salix. In the Alps and other southern areas its main winter foods are berry bearing shrubs including Vaccinium and Empetrum. In spring and autumn it has a more varied diet taking leaves, flowers, berries and seeds of a wide range of plants. Most populations make limited movements, which are largely altitudinal and depend on local conditions and weather (de Juana et al. 2016).","The species faces some pressures at a local scale, such as habitat degradation and over-hunting (Madge and McGowan 2002). It is particularly susceptible to over-harvesting in the spring. Most habitat loss occurs due to the development of tourist facilities such as ski facilities and collision with cables around ski stations can cause mortality. Human presence may cause disturbance and displace birds from their wintering habitat. It is thought that, in Sweden, overgrazing from reindeer is causing declines (Storch 2007). A recent decrease detected in the Swiss Alps, of 30% in a decade was attributed to climatic change (de Juana et al. 2016). Climatic warming in the Arctic has resulted in a rapid expansion of woody shrubs over the past half century which may result in habitat loss for the species (de Juana et al. 2016).","The global population is estimated to number &gt; c.8,000,000 individuals (Rich et al. 2004). The European population is estimated at 257,000-1,010,000 pairs, which equates to 514,000-2,020,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Europe forms approximately 10% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 5,140,000-20,200,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

Most monitoring is limited to the local scale. In Germany a programme to limit human disturbance by ski-touring has been initiated and in Iceland research into the effects of hunting there is ongoing (Storch 2007).Conservation Actions ProposedMonitoring of populations in areas with potentially high hunting pressures should be undertaken to ensure they are sustainable. Measures should be taken in mountain ranges with high tourism to minimise the spatial and temporal overlap between important habitats and recreational activities and their effectiveness monitored. Also, actions to minimize the numbers of generalist predators in these areas should be taken. Research into the impacts of hunting and habitat alteration on population dynamics should be undertaken.

Population models revealed that even small cat populations lead to dramatic reductions in annual population growth of shearwaters, with one cat capable of depredating an estimated 40.5 birds per month (Keitt et al. 2002). Following the publication of these findings, cats were eradicated from the island and shearwater mortality decreased by more than 90%, to fewer than 100 per month (Keitt and Tershy 2003). It is possible that cat predation caused the extirpation, or at the very least, significantly reduced populations on the main island of Guadalupe (Keitt et al. 2006). The presence of habitat inaccessible to cats provides hope that this species may still breed in small remnant populations on Guadalupe and observed calls from prospecting adults in the cliffs of Melpomene Arroyo, indicate that birds are readily available to recolonize the main island in the absence of cat predation (Keitt et al. 2006). On all islands, introduced herbivores (donkey, goat, sheep and rabbit) have caused erosion (reducing soil for burrows), soil compaction, trampled burrows and destroyed vegetation, and rabbits may also have displaced birds from burrows (Keitt 1998, McChesney and Tershy 1998, B. Tershy and B. Keitt in litt. 1999, Donlan et al. 2000, Tershy et al. 2002). Introduced rodents in Isla Rasa, in the Gulf of California, have been successfully eradicated, but no population monitoring has been carried out since first nesting record occurred in 2010 (Velarde et al. 2015). No mammals have been reported since 2013 on San Benito Oeste (Sánchez et al. 2021b).Between 2014 and early 2016, the birds on Natividad were affected by the presence of a wire fence installed around the landfill adjacent to the colony on the trajectory used by birds when moving from colony to sea. Several carcasses were found during the survey in February 2016 and a study using thermal cameras revealed that the fence caused the mortality of c. 6-7 birds per night, and an estimated 195 deaths per month during the breeding season (suggesting an impact roughly equivalent to the presence of five feral cats) (Albores-Barajas et al. 2016). Upon reporting the mortality levels to the local community and Biosphere Reserve, the fence was immediately removed in April 2016 (Albores-Barajas et al. 2016). The development of infrastructure on Natividad has destroyed at least 15% (26,532 burrows) of the breeding habitat on the island (Keitt et al. 2003) and further development of the fishing community continues to have detrimental effects on the seabirds (Keitt and Albores-Barajas unpublished data). The human population at Natividad Island is increasing, with more houses built over the last few years. Although the houses are concentrated on the town area, there is generally a greater human presence on the island. Occasionally, mountain biking races are organized on the island and the track runs through the colony. Although the bikes tend to stay within the race track, this may cause considerable disturbance to the burrowing seabirds. Activities such as the building and maintenance of roads, off-road driving through the colony, dumping of garbage and humans walking through the colony all pose threats to the population (Keitt et al. 2003). Other ongoing threats include incidental capture in artisanal fisheries, dogs excavating burrows (McChensey and Tershy 1998), as well as predation by raven Corvus corax and Western Gull Larus occidentalis. Ravens have increased due to the provision of water on the island in association with human settlements, and quickly learned to scavenge birds killed and injured by the landfill fence (Albores-Barajas et al. 2016). Predation may also occur, however the shearwater's nocturnal habit reduces this interaction and the impact at present is likely negligible, but worth monitoring. Light pollution reduces the protection offered by nocturnal behaviour, and nightly predation pressures by gulls are higher in lit areas; Black-vented Shearwaters avoid attending the colony when the light level is above –2.2 log10L because of threat posed by gulls. Hence, anthropogenic light sources that illuminate colonies could affect seabirds by increasing predation and decreasing access to the colony, leading to decreased foraging efficiency and ability to provide for chicks (Keitt et al. 2004).Further threat results from a large number of the species spending the non-breeding season in the Southern California Bight where boat traffic is high and oil spills are possible (B. Keitt in litt. 2008).","The vast majority of the population (&gt;95%) breeds on Natividad (Keitt 1998). On the San Benito islands, there used to be at least several thousand pairs (B. Tershy and B. Keitt in litt. 1999), but only 250-500 pairs were estimated in 1991 (Everett and Anderson 1991), and during the 2017-2019 breeding season, 121 breeding pairs were estimated (Sánchez et al. 2021a). On Guadalupe, the population was estimated at 2,500 pairs in 1991 (Everett and Anderson 1991), although may now be extirpated here (Sánchez et al. 2021a). In 1927, nesting was reported in Isla Rasa, Gulf of California, but the species is believed to be extirpated from that island by introduced rodents (Velarde et al. 2015). Nesting has been reported again since 2010; however, the size of the nesting population has not been determined (Velarde et al. 2015).The total population estimated in 1998-1999 was around 80,000 pairs, and therefore 160,000 mature individuals. However, it is likely that the methods used in 1998-99 overestimated the population size, as counts of nests in selected areas were extrapolated to the whole surface of the island used by birds, without considering that there were large areas without any burrows. In 2016, aerial photography and GIS were used to count the total number of occupied and unoccupied burrows in Natividad Island during the breeding season (Albores-Barajas et al. 2016). The total number of burrows counted, including occupied and abandoned burrows, was 56,400, but with a relatively low occupancy (between 75% and 50% depending on the area). The counts gave a figure of 37,900 (± 8500 SE) breeding pairs, equating to about 75,800 mature individuals. This figure was based on the initial occupancy of burrows in February 2016. Of these initially occupied burrows, 4,500 (about 12%) were later abandoned (Albores-Barajas et al. 2016). During the 2017-2019 breeding season, through further surveys on nest or burrow densities, 118,920 breeding pairs were counted on Natividad (Sánchez et al. 2021a), roughly equating to 238,000 mature individuals. Given the small populations present on other islands off Mexico's Pacific coast, the population is therefore placed in the band 200,000-299,999 mature individuals.",Stable,"Puffinus opisthomelas breeds on five islands or small islets off the Pacific coast of Mexico (Guadalupe, San Benito East, San Benito Middle, San Benito West and Natividad) and on Isla Rasa in the Gulf of California. During the non-breeding season, it disperses along the Pacific coast from Monterrey and San Francisco bays (U.S.A.) and rarely British Columbia (Canada) in the north to the Gulf of California and further south to Nayarit, Jalisco and Colima (Mexico) (Carboneras 1992, Keitt et al. 2020).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayNatividad is a core area of the Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, where there is some active management. In 1997-1998, goats and sheep were removed with the cooperation of the local fishing community (Keitt 1998). Cats were controlled in 1998, and eradicated by 2002 (B. Tershy and B. Keitt in litt. 1999, Keitt et al. undated). In 2016, the perimetral fence of the landfill was removed (Albores-Barajas et al. 2016). In 1998-1999, introduced herbivores were eradicated from San Benito (B. Tershy and B. Keitt in litt. 1999) and no invasive vertebrates were found on the island until 2006 (B. Keitt in litt. 2008). On San Benito Oeste, in 2006, a subspecies of the Cactus mouse Peromyscus eremicus (subspecies cedrosensis) was accidentally introduced; mouse eradication was successfully implemented in December 2013 and no mammals have been reported since (Sánchez et al. 2021b). Guadalupe is designated as a biosphere reserve (S.N.G. Howell in litt. 1998), and the process of eradicating the cats is underway.Conservation Actions ProposedProduce an up-to-date estimate of the population size. Assess the population trend. Quantify the impact of bycatch and other threats on the population size. Monitor the population trend. Prohibit future road construction on Natividad. Control the access of visitors to middle and west San Benitos islands (B. Tershy and B. Keitt in litt. 1999). Remove rubbish or manage in a more efficient way (B. Tershy and B. Keitt in litt. 1999, Albores-Barajas et al. 2016). Prevent future introductions of native (gulls and ravens) and non-native predators. Ensure all breeding islands remain free of cats and exotic rodents (B. Tershy and B. Keitt in litt. 1999, Velarde et al. 2015). Protect breeding burrows from disturbance by dogs.

Nevertheless, declines have been recorded in several key populations and overall a moderately rapid global decline is estimated. As a result, the species has been uplisted to Near Threatened; it almost qualifies for threatened under criteria A2bcd+3bcd+4bcd.","Behaviour Most populations of this species are fully migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and breed from April to August (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary territorial pairs (Johnsgard 1981), occasionally also forming small colonies (Flint et al. 1984). After breeding adults gather on coasts (from July onwards) (Hayman et al. 1986) for the post-breeding moult (Snow and Perrins 1998) before migrating south to the wintering grounds between July and November (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species departs its wintering grounds again from February through to May, although non-breeders may remain in the wintering areas all-year-round (del Hoyo et al. 1996). During the winter the species usually forages singly or in small groups (del Hoyo et al. 1996) occasionally aggregating into flocks of several thousand individuals, especially at roosting sites (Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on upland moors, peat bogs, swampy and dry heathlands, fens, open grassy or boggy areas in forests, damp grasslands, meadows (del Hoyo et al. 1996), non-intensive farmland in river valleys (Hayman et al. 1986), dune valleys and coastal marshlands (del Hoyo et al. 1996) Non-breeding During the winter the species frequents muddy coasts, bays and estuaries (del Hoyo et al. 1996) with tidal mudflats and sandflats (Snow and Perrins 1998), rocky and sandy beaches with many pools (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998), mangroves, saltmarshes (Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal meadows and pasture (Johnsgard 1981, Navedo et al. 2013) and muddy shores of coastal lagoons (Johnsgard 1981), inland lakes and rivers (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It also utilises wet grassland and arable fields during migration (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Its diet consists chiefly of annelid worms and terrestrial insects (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (e.g. Coleoptera and Orthoptera) (Johnsgard 1981) especially during the summer (del Hoyo et al. 1996), although it will also take crustaceans, molluscs, polychaete worms (del Hoyo et al. 1996), spiders (Johnsgard 1981), berries and seeds, as well as occasionally small fish, amphibians, lizards, young birds and small rodents (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression on the ground or on a mound (Flint et al. 1984) in the open or in the cover of grass or sedge (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Management information A study into the effects of shellfish harvesting by hand in coastal intertidal habitats recommends that the harvesting load should be limited to -1 during this species's autumn migration (Navedo and Masero 2007).","The species is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of moorland habitats as a result of afforestation (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Johnsgard 1981) and of marginal grassland habitats as a result of agricultural intensification and improvement (Johnsgard 1981, Baines 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1996) (e.g. drainage, inorganic fertilisation and reseeding) (Baines 1988). The species also suffers from high egg and chick mortalities due to agricultural practices (e.g. Tuellinghoff &amp; Bergmann 1993, Grant 1997, Fisher &amp; Walker 2015) human disturbance (Boschert and Rupp 1993) and higher predation rates if nesting on improved grasslands or in fragmented landscapes (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Valkama and Korpimäki 1999, Douglas et al. 2014). Conversely some populations have declined following abandonment of farmland and subsequent increases in the height of vegetation (Broyer and Roche 1991), rendering large areas unsuitable for nesting. Climate change is projected to have a large negative impact on this species during the breeding season (Huntley et al. 2007, Renwick et al. 2012). Expansion of renewable energy projects including wind farms can also have an impact although more studies are required (Pearce-Higgins et al. 2009). It has also suffered population declines as a result of hunting (Johnsgard 1981), and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Wintering populations are threatened by disturbance on intertidal mudflats (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Burton et al. 2002a, 2002b) (e.g. from construction work (Burton et al. 2002a) and foot-traffic (Burton et al. 2002b)), development on high-tide roosting sites, pollution (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and the flooding of estuarine mudflats and saltmarshes as a result of tidal barrage construction (Burton 2006, Porter et al. 2008). The species is also threatened by the degradation of migrational staging areas owing to land reclamation, pollution, human disturbance and reduced river flows (Kelin and Qiang 2006). Local populations of this species have also declined owing to hunting pressures (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and mechanised shellfish harvesting (Taylor and Dodd 2013).","The global population is estimated to number c.835,000-1,310,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016). The European population is estimated at 212,000-292,000 pairs, which equates to 425,000-584,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015), and is roughly equivalent to 647,500-876,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"This species is widely distributed, breeding across Europe from the British Isles, through north-western Europe and Scandinavia into Russia extending east into Siberia, east of Lake Baikal. It winters around the coasts of north-west Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent, South-East Asia, Japan and the Sundas. It has a large global population estimated to number c.835,000-1,310,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016). The breeding population in Europe (212,000-292,000 pairs) has declined in recent years, with the population most recently estimated to be decreasing by 30-49% in 31.2 years (three generations) (BirdLife International 2015). The population in the United Kingdom has undergone a 62% decline over the period 1970-2012, and a 46% decline over the period 1995-2013 (Harris et al. 2014, Hayhow et al. 2014). A range decline of 78% has been calculated in Ireland between 1968-1972 and 2007-2011 (Balmer et al. 2013). Long-term declines have occurred in Norway, Sweden and Finland since the early 1980s; these declines continue except in Finland where the population stabilised between 2001-12 (BirdLife International 2015). Whilst the population appears to have fluctuated in Belarus, the population in Estonia declined by 50-70% from 1980-2012 (Elts et al. 2013, BirdLife International 2015) and long-term declines estimated at 5-30% since the 1980s have occurred in European Russia, which is estimated to support 45,000-100,000 breeding pairs (BirdLife International 2015). Long-term declines of between 18-50% since the early 1980s have also been recorded in the Netherlands and Germany (Hötker et al. 2007, BirdLife International 2015); Dutch declines continue but the German population has shown recent signs of stability (BirdLife International 2015). The long-term breeding population trend in France is stable but has declined by 20-25% over the period 1996-2010 (BirdLife International 2015). Declines have also been reported for the Czech Republic, Denmark (down 17% between 1999-2011, though this followed a longer-term increase), Lithuania (20-30% per decade [L. Raudonikis in litt. 2007]), Poland (50-60% decline between 2000 and 2013), Slovakia, and Switzerland and the European breeding population overall is estimated to be decreasing by 30-49% in 31.2 years (three generations) (BirdLife International 2015). Unquantified, but potentially highly significant, declines have also been recorded in the central Asian populations of N. a. orientalis (J. Kamp and S. Sklyarenko in litt. 2007). In eastern Siberia (I. Fefelov in litt. 2007) breeding populations are apparently stable and apparent increases in wintering populations along the East Atlantic Flyway (van Roomen et al. 2015), including the Wadden Sea (Laursen and Karsten 2005, Meltofte et al. 2009, Laursen and Fricke 2013), as well as on the Adriatic coast (Gusson et al. 2005), and in East Asia (M. Barter in litt. 2007) suggest that breeding populations, probably in European Russia and northern Siberia have perhaps increased. Other possible explanations – or contributing factors - for the discrepancy between breeding and wintering trends include data limitations (for both breeding and wintering trend data) and trends being obscured by a climate-mediated shift in wintering range (Brown 2015).Overall, analysis of the compiled trend data indicate three generation (15 year) estimate of decline of between 26% and 34% (Hillis 2003, BirdLife International 2004, Thorup 2006, Wetlands International 2006, A. J. van Djik in litt. 2007, M. Barter in litt. 2007, A. Copland in litt. 2007, M. Boschert in litt. 2007, Eaton et al. 2007, R. Gregory in litt. 2007). Owing to the uncertainty over whether declines in southern populations have been compensated by increases in northern populations, the global trend is suspected to fall within the band 20-30% declines in the past 15 years or three generations.","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayAnnex I and II of the EU Birds Directive. A management plan for the species, updated for 2007-2009, was published in 2007, covering the EU portion of the species's range (Jensen and Lutz 2007), with a new plan published in 2015 (Brown 2015). A five year moratorium on hunting the species was implemented in France in July 2008 (A. Duncan in litt. 2008), but it was partially lifted in 2012 (D. Brown in litt. 2016). The species occurs in a large number of protected areas throughout its range and features in several national monitoring schemes. Conservation Actions ProposedA range of conservation actions were proposed as part of the updated action plan (Brown 2015), which are listed here. Ensure protection for key sites for this species, and make sure these are appropriately managed. Raise awareness for the species, particularly amongst farming communities, and work proactively with farmers to promote land management techniques that would benefit the species. If possible, try to reinstate the moratorium of hunting the species in France, and quantify the level of hunting in other areas (such as European Russia). Ensure that illegal hunting is prevented where the species is not allowed to be hunted. Conduct surveys to update population and trend estimates, gain greater insight into the species's life history, better understand its range and movements, and better understand the threats it faces.

It is therefore listed as Endangered.","It is confined to open, arid shrub-grassland at elevations of 1,200-2,450 m (Wege et al. 1993, Behrstock et al. 1997) where breeding sites have been found in associations of tarbush (Flourensia cernua), creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) and short grassland (Garza de Leon et al. 2007, Canales del Castillo et al. 2010). It probably keys-in on certain vegetational structural components, such as open areas with low (grazed) grasses for foraging and a moderate complement of low, dense shrubs for cover and nesting (Behrstock et al. 1997, Garza de Leon et al. 2007, Canales del Castillo et al. 2010). Taller shrubs and trees may serve as observation or song perches, but a lack of shrubs over 0.5 m is not a deterrent to habitat occupancy (Behrstock et al. 1997). In recently discovered breeding areas, 196 characterized nests showed a preference mainly for tarbush and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens) as nesting shrubs (Ruvalcaba-Ortega et al. in prep., Canales del Castillo et al. 2010). Nests of 3-5 eggs have been found between May and August (Garza de Leon et al. 2007, Canales del Castillo et al. 2010). Single-species flocks form after the breeding season (Wege et al. 1993) and are apparently strongly attracted to permanent water (Behrstock et al. 1997).","Open shrub-grasslands have been greatly reduced by agriculture and grazing, and the rate of habitat conversion is increasing, primarily for production of potatoes (M. A. Cruz-Nieto in litt. 2007). There has been a progressive loss of habitat even on the Coahuila-Nuevo León border, especially in the El Potosí Valley (M. A. Cruz-Nieto in litt. 2007). Grazing and the use of chemicals modify and reduce the quality of the habitat and disturb nesting birds (Garza de Leon et al. 2007). It seems unlikely that large tracts of habitat remain near the currently known sites (Wege et al. 1993, Garza de Leon et al. 2007, Canales del Castillo et al. 2010). Reported reproductive success is very low, only 14% in La India, and 18.3% overall based on monitoring of 175 nests (R. Canales del Castillo, I. Ruvalcaba Ortega and J. González Rojas in litt. 2016); predation (Garza de Leon et al. 2007, Ruvalcaba-Ortega et al. in prep.) and livestock disturbance (Canales del Castillo et al. 2010) seem to be the main causes, but it is not known how this affects populations (Garza de Leon et al. 2007). Snakes, birds and coyotes are thought to predate nests (Ruvalcaba-Ortega et al. in prep., M. A. Cruz-Nieto in litt. 2007).","Wintering flocks of over 100 individuals have been observed in several occasions in Nuevo León (2014-2015), Coahuila (2010-2011) and San Luis Potosí (2010-2014), with a maximum flock size of 480 Worthen’s sparrows in San Luis Potosí (2010; Ruvalcaba-Ortega et al. in prep.). Precautionarily assuming that such flocks comprise the majority or even all of the remaining population, and given the very low productivity in the species, the total population size may be only best placed in the range 250-999 mature individuals; and their winter flocking behaviour would therefore suggest the species consists of one subpopulation. Previous smaller estimations (60-100; Canales del Castillo et al. 2010) recorded in 2006, may have been due to the lack of more widespread survey efforts.",Decreasing,"Spizella wortheni has suffered a major range contraction and currently only breeds at sites in Coahuila, Nuevo León, Zacatecas, and San Luis Potosí Mexico (Ruvalcaba-Ortega et al. in prep): More than 25 five localities have been recorded in these four states from recent intensive survey efforts, which can be grouped in 5 main regions: La Soledad Valley, Saltillo intermountain grasslands, Galeana agricultural lands around 57-highway, north-east Zacatecas-north-west San Luis Potosí grasslands, and Charcas-SantoDomingo grasslands (Canales-Delgadillo et al. 2015, Canale-Delgadillo 2011, Canales del Castillo et al. 2010, Scott-Morales et al. 2008, Garza de Leon et al. 2007, Behrstock et al. 1997, Wege et al. 1993, Ruvalcaba-Ortega et al. in prep.). Wintering flocks of &gt;100 individuals have been observed in several occasions in Nuevo León (2014-2015), Coahuila (2010-2011) and San Luis Potosí (2010-2014), with a maximum flock size of 480 Worthen’s sparrows in San Luis Potosí (2010; Ruvalcaba-Ortega et al. in prep., R. Canales del Castillo, I. Ruvalcaba Ortega and J. González Rojas in litt. 2016). Thorough surveys may find additional sites because suitable habitat remains within its historical range (M. A. Cruz-Nieto in litt. 2007).

There are records from eight states, but it was last recorded in Puebla in 1893, Tamaulipas in 1924, Veracruz before 1957 and Chihuahua in 1959.

In the east it is found increasingly not only in built-up areas, but also in open arid country. In the Far East where P. domesticus is absent it is common in built-up areas and is even found in urban centres. In the north of its range the breeding season begins from April or May and to January in the extreme south of Asia. It breeds in loose colonies. The nest is constructed of dried grass and rootlets, lined with feathers and animal fur and is domed (even when in a hole), with as entrance on the side. It is mostly sited in a hole in a tree, earth bank, cliff or artificial structure, sometimes in the base of a large nest of heron (Ardeidae), crow (Corvidae) or bird of prey. Occasionally it is a free-standing nest in a tree, but then usually hidden in thick conifer or creepers. Clutches are two to seven eggs. The diet is mainly seeds and it prefers smaller seeds of low herbs and grasses, including cultivated cereals but it also takes a significant proportion of animal food (Summers-Smith 2016). In Europe the species is largely sedentary (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). In central Asia, the species makes more pronounced movements. Birds in the extreme north of the range withdraw to the south and those living in the countryside tend to move into built-up areas (Summers-Smith 2016).",Declines in this species in Europe may be a result of changes in agricultural practices such as the increased use of pesticides and herbicides and the autumn sowing of cereals which have lead to decreases in food for this species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).,"Rich et al. (2004) estimated the global population to number 20,000,000 individuals. In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number 24,000,000-38,200,000 pairs, which equates to 47,900,000-76,400,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Declines are believed to be driven primarily by trapping in its passage and non-breeding ranges. A programme of coordinated range-wide monitoring and action is badly needed to quantify the magnitude of the decline and reduce the impact of threats. If the rate of decline is subsequently found to be lower, the species must no longer be listed as Critically Endangered regardless of it continuing to be an extremely high priority for conservation action.","It breeds in wet meadows with tall vegetation and scattered scrub, riverside thickets and secondary scrub. It winters in large flocks in cultivated areas, rice fields and grasslands, preferring scrubby dry-water rice fields for foraging and reedbeds for roosting (T. Gray in litt. 2007). The breeding season is normally from the second half of June to the beginning of July. The nest is built by the female alone and is placed either on the ground in a depression under tussocks or roots or slightly above ground in well covered vegetation. It is constructed of dry grass and stalks lined with soft grass, rootlets and sometimes hair. Clutch size can vary between three and seven but most commonly four to five. During the breeding season it feeds mainly on invertebrates and at other times it will feed on seeds and other plant material. The species is migratory, wintering from central and eastern Nepal, Bangladesh, north-east India east to south-east China (Guangdong) and Taiwan (Province of China), south to the north Malay Peninsula and south-east Asia (Copete and Sharpe 2016).","Since many populations on pristine breeding grounds have dropped rapidly, the decline is likely to be driven by excessive trapping at migration and, in particular, wintering sites (Kamp et al. 2015, S. Chan in litt. 2003, 2007, P. Round in litt. 2003, M. Williams in litt. 2007). Roosting flocks in reedbeds are disturbed and then caught in mist-nets, they are cooked and sold as ""sparrows"" or ""rice-birds""; this practice was formerly restricted to a small area of southern China, but has now become more widespread and popular owing to increasing affluence, and hunters now have to travel widely to find sufficient birds (M. Lau in litt. 2007, M. Williams in litt. 2007, S. Chan in litt. 2007). From 1992 onwards, an estimated several thousand individuals of this species were caught for the annual food festival in Sanshui City, southern China (Gao Yuren 1996). This practice was banned in 1997, but a black market in birds still persists and a huge number of birds are still sold annually (see Kamp et al. 2015), including around 10,000 birds sold daily in a single market in Sanshui (Chan 2004). In 2008, one shipment of 4,300 individuals of this species was reportedly confiscated in Zhejiang province en route to Guangdong province, and the species is said to remain a famous delicacy in southern China (per M. Zhang in litt. 2013). Likewise, the species is considered a delicacy in Cambodia (F. Goes in litt. 2013) and is trapped to be sold to restaurants in Nepal (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral in litt. 2013). In China, thousands of males are also stuffed and sold as mascots, since their presence in the home is thought to confer happiness (A. Mischenko in litt. 2012). At least locally, for example in Cambodia, birds are trapped for ""merit release"" in temples (Gilbert et al. 2012, J. C. Eames in litt. 2007, F. Goes in litt. 2013). Agricultural intensification, the shift to irrigated rice production and consequent loss of winter stubble has reduced the quality and quantity of wintering habitat, and the loss of reedbeds has reduced the number of available roost sites (T. Evans in litt. 2007, J. Tordoff in litt. 2007, J. C. Eames in litt. 2007). Declines caused by pressures on the wintering grounds are compounded by a reduction in habitat quality on the breeding grounds in parts of its range, particularly drying of meadows caused by changes in the flow pattern of rivers, a result of dam construction upstream (O. Goroshko in litt. 2003, J. Kamp in litt. 2007). Declines in Nepal have also been partly attributed to changes in agricultural practices since the 1980s, notably sharp increases in pesticide use (Inskipp and Baral 2011).","In Europe, the breeding population was estimated to number 20,000-100,000 breeding pairs, equating to 60,000-300,000 individuals (BirdLife International 2004). Europe, at least formerly, formed 25-49% of the global range. The European population is now estimated to number just 120-600 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species once bred across the northern Palaearctic from Finland, Belarus and Ukraine in the west, through Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia, to far eastern Russia, Korea and northern Japan. However, after a precipitous decline it is now thought to have potentially completely disappeared from Finland, Belarus, Ukraine and large parts of Russia (Kamp et al. 2015). In the autumn, birds stop-over in large numbers to moult in the Yangtze Valley, China, before continuing on to their winter quarters. It winters in a relatively small region in South and South-East Asia, which includes eastern Nepal, north-eastern India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, southern China, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand (Byers et al. 1995). It was formerly one of the most abundant breeding passerines across vast swathes of Siberia, but although there have been no systematic surveys, a severe decline has been noted in most breeding areas and it has completely disappeared from parts of its former breeding range since the early 1990s (Kamp et al. 2015). No birds have been recorded breeding in Finland since 2009, and its range has contracted northwards by 300 km in Kazakhstan since the late 1990s, although it does persist in some areas of Kazakhstan, such as along the Irtysh river near Irtyshsk (R. Ayé in litt. 2013). It is estimated to have declined by 95-99% in European Russia between 2000 and 2012 (BirdLife International 2015). Declines have been reported in the Moscow, Novgorod, Kostroma, Ulyanovsk and Baikal regions (A. Mischenko in litt. 2012), whilst very rapid declines in the Tyumen region were reported in 2011 (J. Kamp in litt. 2012), suggesting a massive decline in the core range (M. Flade in litt. 2007). Surveys in 2012 and 2013 suggest that the species has nearly or completely disappeared from Tyumen province in Western Siberia, which appears consistent with an impression of a steep decline across Western Siberia (J. Kamp et al. in litt. 2013). In contrast, recent surveys within and outside protected areas in Amur and Chabarovsk regions, suggest that the species is faring better in the east of its breeding range, with an estimate of 100-150 breeding pairs in Muraviovka Park (c.6,500 ha) in 2013, although anecdotal evidence indicates a decline in these areas since the 1990s (J. Kamp et al. in litt. 2013). Severe declines have also been noted in Hokkaido, Japan and Mongolia (Tamada et al. 2014, S. Chan and O. Goroshko in litt. 2003, Tamada 2006, M. Gilbert, A. Mischenko and J. Kamp in litt. 2007). Kamp et al. (2015) have estimated that between 1980 and 2013 the population may have declined by 84.3-94.7%, with an eastwards range retraction of 5,000 km.It no longer occurs in ""swarms"" at migration watch-points such as Beidaihe, China, and although a range-wide survey is required, numbers at wintering sites throughout its range have also shown rapid declines over the last twenty years (S. Chan, M. Williams, J. W. Duckworth and N. Moores in litt. 2003, T. Evans, M. Gilbert, M. Williams and S. Chan in litt. 2007). Based on evidence from wintering grounds in Cambodia the species is said to be clearly declining (T. Gray in litt. 2013). Historically, it was noted to be common on the central plain, but is now considered scarce away from the Tonle Sap area, and surveys of birds used in ""merit releases"" at Phnom Penh riverfront suggest a steep decline in this species since the mid-1990s in the Mekong-Bassac floodplain, where most merit-bird trappers operate (F. Goes in litt. 2013). Furthermore, there has been a lack of records from south-eastern Cambodia since the late 1990s, suggesting that it is very rare and perhaps close to extirpation in that region (F. Goes in litt. 2013). In Nepal, declines in the population and number of localities occupied have been noted since 1990 (C. Inskipp and H. S. Baral in litt. 2013, Inskipp et al. 2016). It also appears to have declined at the Hail Haor wetland in north-eastern Bangladesh since the mid-1980s (P. Thompson in litt. 2013, 2017). It should be noted that interpretation of the species's status in its non-breeding range based on the usually fragmentary information available is hindered by the erratic appearance of very large flocks (J. W. Duckworth in litt. 2013).","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation and research actions underwayCMS Appendix I; It was included in the African-Eurasian Migratory Landbirds Action Plan (AEMLAP) (African-Eurasian Migratory Landbirds Working Group 2014). It is counted occasionally as part of on-going IBA monitoring in a few sites. After media exposure of the crisis there was an attempt to clamp down on illegal trade in this species (S. Chan in litt. 2013), but this practice likely still persists (see Kamp et al. 2015). There is ongoing research on Sakhalin to find out if difference in migration strategies (e. g. key stopover and wintering sites) is responsible for contrasting sustainability of different populations. The study uses stable isotopes sampled from free-ranging birds and collection specimens, and geologger tracking of sustainable populations. (P. Ktitorov in litt. 2017).Conservation and research actions proposedImplement a programme of co-ordinated range-wide monitoring at breeding, passage and non-breeding sites, in order to quantify the rate of decline. Through awareness campaigns, reduce the demand for the species as a food item, mascot and merit-bird. Research its precise habitat requirements on the wintering grounds. Protect sites which still hold large numbers on the wintering grounds. Better enforce legislation against illegal trapping and trade (J.

The species is consequently precautionarily maintained as Critically Endangered, since although it now occurs at two locations and was recently translocated to a third island, population fluctuations have continued within the past five years.","The species is non-migratory and characterised by female-only parental care and high adult survival. On Laysan, long-term pair bonds are common, and 3-4 eggs are laid per clutch. The timing of breeding varies significantly between years, with the beginning of incubation varying from December to July (Reynolds et al. 2007). It selects different habitats during different times of the day. Most adult birds use dense cover and hide in the terrestrial vegetation during the day. During the evening and at night (Reynolds 2004), the species uses the central hyper-saline lake on Laysan, but concentrates near freshwater seeps around the shore (M. Morin in litt. 1999), especially when raising young ducklings which are less tolerant of hyper-saline conditions. It nests and rests in dense stands of shrubs and grasses (Moulton and Marshall 1996). It feeds principally on invertebrates, but also grass and sedge seeds, and some algae (Reynolds et al. 2006a); brine fly Scatella sexnotata is an important prey species whose peak spring abundance is positively correlated with annual brood production of the teal (Reynolds et al. 2007). Reintroduced birds on Midway Atoll appear to breed successfully at an earlier age and produce larger clutches than birds on Laysan, probably owing to more food and a low population density. On Midway, individuals in their first year and produce an average clutch of seven eggs, whereas birds on Laysan nest in their second year, producing an average of 3.3 eggs (Walters and Reynolds 2013). Duckling survival is low on both sites.","Random disasters and the limited carrying capacity of the fragile tiny islands are the main threats to the species's persistence. Historic declines on Laysan leading to the near-extinction of the species are attributed to introduced rabbits and, more recently, the parasitic nematode Echinuria uncinata, coupled with drought (Work et al. 2004). Since the severe range contraction of the species from the main Hawaiian Islands after the introduction of rats, stochastic events that have already occurred include: the accidental introduction of noxious competitors, extreme weather, and disease epizootics. Additional populations on different islands are needed to reduce the extinction risk to small concentrated populations from alien predator introductions, tsunamis, and hurricanes, as the probability that disasters will affect several islands simultaneously is lower.  In March 2011, an earthquake off the east coast of Japan triggered a tsunami that arrived at the north-western Hawaiian Islands at night and partially inundated Midway Atoll and Laysan Island (M. Reynolds in litt. 2012). It is reported to have over-washed 60-78% of Eastern Island and 15-20% of Sand Island, and affected c.15% of the species's breeding habitat on Laysan (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011, M. Reynolds in litt. 2012). A botulism outbreak followed due to the more than 110,000 dead albatross chicks left by the flooding (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011, M. Reynolds in litt. 2012). Freshwater wetlands were also contaminated with sea water and carcasses (M. Reynolds in litt. 2012). Most of the vegetation on Eastern Island was lost. Prior to the tsunami, two winter storms struck in January and February, bringing high wind and extensive flooding. Following the winter storms and tsunami, the population experienced complete reproductive failure (M. Reynolds in litt. 2012). On Laysan Island, brood rearing habitat is probably an important limiting factor. Freshwater seeps with high invertebrate abundance and adjacent dense vegetative cover are used as duckling nurseries. High incidence of duckling trauma suggests these freshwater seeps may become overcrowded. Reproductive success is sometimes related to brine fly (prey abundance) densities which, in turn, are reduced by drought and low water-levels (Moulton and Marshall 1996, M. Reynolds unpublished data). During drought conditions, the birds depend more on terrestrial prey (Reynolds 2004). Introduced ants (e.g. big-headed ant Pheidole megacephala) are probably competitors for their terrestrial invertebrate prey (Reynolds et al. 2006b). Disease or parasitic infestation by the nematode Echinuria uncinata (M. Reynolds in litt. 2000) are perhaps one of the greatest potential threats - the catastrophic outbreak of avian botulism killed 40-50% of teal on Midway in 2008 (M. Reynolds in litt. 2008, Work et al. 2010), and an outbreak of this disease has occurred every year since (M. Reynolds in litt. 2011, 2012, J. Walters in litt. 2011). Some alien invasive plants on Laysan have threatened nesting and wetland habitat (Morin et al. 1997, M. Morin in litt. 1999), including the central hyper-saline lake where the species forages (VanderWerf 2012). The wetlands on Midway are threatened by future flooding events and require periodic maintenance, including management of wetland plants and algae and the removal of alien mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) (VanderWerf 2012).Having a distribution on relatively low-lying islands, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change through sea-level rise and shifts in suitable climatic conditions (BirdLife International unpublished data). Other threats faced by the species include accelerated filling of the interior lake and freshwater seeps due to alien wetland plant species, and erosion of dunes from storm impacts (M. Reynolds in litt. 2011).","The total population on Laysan Island was estimated at 521 birds (95% CI: 492-549) in 2010, with probably over 400 individuals (between 268 and 473) on Midway in 2010 (M. Reynolds in litt. 2011). Twenty-eight individuals were translocated to Kure Atoll in 2014. This suggests that the population numbers c.500-680 mature individuals in total.",Increasing,"The species is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.), where it became confined to Laysan Island. The birds do not disperse from Laysan today, but sub-fossil remains indicate that it was widespread on the Hawaiian Islands in the past (Reynolds and Kozar 2000), most recently being extirpated from Lisianski Island about 150 years ago. The species was near extinction at the beginning of the 20th century, but the population increased to 500 individuals in 1987 (Marshall 1992), following the removal of introduced rabbits from Laysan. In 1993, there was a complete breeding failure and severe die-off owing to drought and disease. Poor monitoring at this time impairs accurate population estimates, but post-hoc analysis suggests that the population dropped to 82-127 adults from a peak of 743 birds prior to the drought. Since then, the population gradually increased, reaching an estimated 521 birds in 2010 (M. Reynolds in litt. 2011). Apparent population fluctuations over the past century were previously attributed to differing methods and seasons of counts (Marshall 1992), but are now thought to relate to genuine changes (M. Reynolds and G. Ritchotte in litt. 2002). With the Laysan population possibly approaching carrying capacity, 42 individuals were translocated to the two islands of Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in 2004 and 2005; the birds bred successfully in their first year (Reynolds and Klaviter 2006). The founder population increased in size to a total of 104 individuals in 2006 (Jarrett 2006), reaching c.200 adult and juvenile (post-fledging) individuals by the end of 2007 (USGS unpublished data, Reynolds et al. 2008) and predicted to grow to a total of 380 birds (Reynolds et al. 2008). Although being hit by an outbreak of avian botulism in 2008 which killed over 160 birds (a decline of up to 40-50%) (M. Reynolds in litt. 2008), the preliminary estimates from Midway placed the population in 2010 at c. 350 (M. Reynolds in litt. 2010). The Laysan population is believed to have been reduced by 50% following a tsunami in March 2011 (J. R. Walters in litt. 2013). On Midway, approximately 20-30% of the banded adult birds observed before this tsunami were not observed afterwards (M. Reynolds in litt. 2012). In 2014, 28 individuals were translocated from Midway Atoll to Kure Atoll, a mammalian predator-free island which lies approximately 1,350 miles north-west of Honolulu (Ward and Fredrickson 2014). As of early May 2015, 19 ducklings had hatched on the island (Anon. 2015). ","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I. Laysan is part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge. The alien grass Cenchrus echinatus is thought to have been eradicated (M. Morin in litt. 1999) and native bunch grass has responded positively (Reynolds et al. 2006b). Snow fences were installed 20 years ago to reduce the movement of sand and support natural revegetation (Moulton and Marshall 1996). A comprehensive restoration plan for Laysan Island has been developed, some sections of which are underway (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009). In 2004-2005, 42 wild birds translocated from Laysan Island were released on Midway Atoll and many bred successfully in their first season. Management on Midway Atoll includes monitoring the ecology and demography of the species as well as the enhancement and creation of freshwater wetland habitats (VanderWerf 2012). Following the success of the releases on Midway, the next translocations were discussed for Kure or Lisianski Islands in the north-west Hawaiian Islands (USGS unpublished data, M. Reynolds in litt. 2008) and in 2014, Kure Atoll received 28 individuals from Midway Atoll (Ward and Fredrickson 2014). During the 2008 avian botulism outbreak on Midway, 28 sick birds were successfully treated with anti-toxin, rehabilitated and released, and the rapid removal of sick and dead birds was thought to have prevented the impact of the outbreak becoming even worse (M. Reynolds in litt. 2008). Management strategies have been initiated on Midway Atoll that should reduce the future impact of avian botulism outbreaks, including: annual flooding of the concrete-lined catchment during the summer months; drainage and cleaning of the catchment in the autumn or winter months to remove accumulated debris and seabird remains; vegetation removal around wetlands to allow carcass detection; weekly population monitoring that includes carcass removal and searches for sick birds; wetland carcass searches daily during the summer months; and use of heavy equipment and portable pumps each year to improve water quality (Work et al. 2010). Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor the population size and health on Midway Atoll, Laysan Island and Kure Atoll. Continue to enhance nesting habitat on Midway by planting native bunch grasses. Remove mice (Mus musculus) from Sand Island, Midway, to allow recruitment of native bunch grass (VanderWerf 2012). Enhance brood-rearing habitat on Midway Atoll with small fish-free freshwater wetlands with abundant cover. Use translocation and ecosystem restoration to re-establish three additional populations of Laysan Ducks. On Laysan, continue to stabilise dunes by planting native vegetation (Moulton and Marshall 1996) and remove alien plant species (VanderWerf 2012). Restore freshwater wetlands on Lisianski prior to potential re-introduction. Ensure strict procedures to prevent the accidental introduction of exotic plants, invertebrates and animals (Moulton and Marshall 1996). Control exotic plants likely to negatively impact the species. Conduct further alien predator eradications to create potential for reintroduction to other larger, higher elevated islands. After restored predator-free habitat is available, create a new genetically managed captive population within Hawaii to provide birds for reintroductions to other Hawaiian islands (Reynolds et al. 2006b). Assess genetic variability of translocated populations for several generations post-translocation, and introduce new individuals where necessary to maintain genetic variation in the population (Lavretsky et al. 2014). Investigate the feasibility of vaccinating at least some birds in the Midway Atoll population against avian botulism (Work et al. 2010). Investigate the driving forces behind differences in fecundity, clutch size and population fluctuations between birds on Midway and Laysan (VanderWerf 2012). ",Oceanian,,false,false,Global

The Alaka`i stronghold is at 1,000-1,600 m. However, the 1968-1973 surveys found the species at lower altitudes in a few areas, and it may not occur above 1,500 m (USFWS 1983, Scott et al. 1986). The species prefers intact forests with a high canopy (Behnke et al. 2016). It feeds on invertebrates (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987), and has been observed excavating rotting wood from the centre of a twig, presumably for insect larvae (VanderWerf and Roberts 2008). Both parents have been observed bringing food to the nest, with the male providing some food for the female, though the female does also forage independently. A nesting pair in 2007 had a juvenile from a previous nest, indicating the species will attempt to raise two broods (VanderWerf and Roberts 2008).","Lowland forests have been cleared for timber and agriculture, with feral livestock causing further degradation and destruction (USFWS 1983, Scott et al. 1986). Feral pigs continue to be particularly detrimental, additionally dispersing alien plants and facilitating the spread of introduced mosquitoes which transmit avian malaria and avian pox (Scott et al 1986, Pratt 1994, Loope and Medeiros 1995). Domestic and introduced birds provide reservoirs for these diseases, to which there is little resistance in Hawaiian honeycreeper populations (USFWS 1983, Scott et al 1986, Pratt 1994, Lepson 1997). Predation by introduced animals and competition for arthropod resources by introduced taxa (especially Japanese White-eye Zosterops japonicus, wasps and ants) are additional threats (USFWS 1983, Scott et al 1986, Jacobi and Atkinson 1995, Lepson 1997). Introduced plants such as Kahili Ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum), Blackberry (Rubus argutus), Strawberry Guava (Psidium cattleianum), Australian Tree Fern (Cyathea cooperi) and Firetree (Myrica faya) have degraded much native forest in Koke'e, and threaten the remaining habitat. Hurricanes have had major impacts on population size in the past; in 1992 Hurricane Iniki devastated forests throughout Kaua`i, and all bird populations on the island appeared to have been drastically reduced (Pratt 1993, 1994), although some have since recovered. Hurricanes are now thought to displace birds from the small area of suitable habitat at higher elevations and push them into the lowlands where avian malaria is prevalent (Anon. 2007). A growing concern is that rising temperatures could allow mosquitoes to survive at higher altitudes and further transmit avian malaria and avian pox (Anon. 2007) as evidenced by a recent study; over the past two decades there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of avian malaria across the altitudinal range of the Alaka’i Plateau, which coincides with increasing air temperatures and changing patterns of precipitation and streamflow which support increased transmission of the disease (Atkinson et al. 2014) and having a montane distribution that is close to the maximum altitude within its range, this species is potentially susceptible to climate change (BirdLife International unpublished data).","The most recent population estimate from 2012 is 468 individuals (231-916, 95% CI) (L. Crampton et al. in litt. 2015). This equates to approximately 150-610 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species was common and widely distributed in the 1890s on Kaua`i in the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.). During 1968-1973, the total population was estimated at 6,832 (±966 standard error), when it was recorded on the Laau ridge and was fairly widespread in Koke'e (USFWS 1983). Since then, the population has declined and the species has retreated from the Koke`e region and the fringes of the Alaka`i region, and is now uncommon to rare in the Alaka`i (Pratt et al. 1987, Pratt 1993, 1994, Behnke et al. 2016). Recent unpublished survey data indicate dramatic declines (85-89% since 1968-1973) and a decline of c. 64% in its core area in the Alaka`i Swamp from 1970 to 2000 (Anon 2007). The population was estimated to number 1,312 ± 530 birds, based on surveys conducted in April and May 2007 (Hawaii Division of Forestry and Wildlife and USGS, unpublished.data), occupying an area of just 36 km2 (Foster et al. 2004).

It occurs within the Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve, but has declined dramatically within this area. Starting in April 2007, the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources conducted population surveys of forest birds on Kaua'i to determine trends. The Zoological Society of San Diego is developing techniques for rearing Oreomystis creepers from eggs and breeding them in captivity, using the related Hawai`i Creeper, at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center (USFWS 2003). The Hawai`i Creeper has been successfully propagated in captivity, and release of the captive population is planned (USFWS 2003, P. Roberts in litt. 2007). A captive breeding programme for Akikiki was started in 2015, as a collaboration between Kauai Forest Bird Recovery Project, State Department of Land and Natural Resources' Division of Forestry and Wildlife, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service - Pacific Islands Fish and Wildlife Office and San Diego Zoo Global (Buley 2015, L.

Urgent action is required to halt the decline of this species, which until relatively recently was considered not uncommon.","It inhabits wet `ohi`a, `ohi`a/olapa and diverse mesic forest, appearing to tolerate considerable habitat disturbance if sufficient `ohi`a remains (but see Behnke et al. 2016, who found lower occurrence of this species in areas of smaller `ohi`a and greater invasion by non native plants). It is found at 1,050-1,600 m, mostly above 1,100 m, and apparently never occurs in lowland forests. It feeds primarily on spiders and insects, taking nectar very rarely. Breeding occurs at least in March -June, and possibly February; all known nests have been in `ohi`a trees (Lepson and Pratt 1997, Hammond et al. 2015, Kauai Forest Bird Recovery Project, unpubl. data). Mean nest height for ‘Akeke‘e is 11.1 + 2.3 m SD (Hammond et al. 2015).","Development has reduced habitat availability in the Koke`e region, while the spread of exotic plants and feral ungulates is degrading remaining areas (Loope and Medeiros 1995, Lepson and Pratt 1997, VanderWerf 2012). Avian pox and malaria probably cause mortality because introduced mosquitoes (vectors for these diseases) are now common at 900 m, and may breed at 1,200 -1, 400 m (Herrmann and Snetsinger 1997, Lepson 1997, Lepson and Pratt 1997, Glad and Crampton 2015). There is concern that rising average temperatures could allow mosquitoes to survive at higher elevations and increase the exposure of birds to disease (Holmer 2007). A small increase in temperature is predicted to eliminate much of the mosquito-free zone on Kaua`i (U.S. Geological Survey per Holmer 2007) and a recent study has found evidence of this. Over the past two decades there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of avian malaria across the altitudinal range of the Alaka’i Plateau, which coincides with  increasing  air temperatures and changing patterns of precipitation and streamflow,  which in turn support increased transmission of the disease (Atkinson et al. 2014). During this time period, prevalence of malaria remained very low in the few ‘Akeke’e  individuals sampled, which may indicate high susceptibility to this disease (Atkinson et al. 2014). It is predicted that by 2100, there will be no “climatically-suitable” habitat left for this species on Kauai (Fortini et al. 2015). Food resources may be limited by alien wasps and ants which greatly reduce populations of native arthropods (Lepson and Pratt 1997). Introduced birds may also be competitors and introduced predators (particularly rats) probably cause some mortality (Lepson and Pratt 1997).  However, Hammond et al. (2015) observed no predation by rats on the eight nests they monitored, although two nests failed due to failure of the eggs to hatch. Adverse weather may be a significant limiting factor, e.g. prolonged, heavy rains which can result in nesting failure and cause massive mortality among fledglings and juveniles (Lepson and Pratt 1997). Two recent hurricanes resulted in serious damage to Kaua`i's forests (Pratt 1994). ‘Akeke’e appear to avoid, to some extent, areas that have suffered more hurricane damage, and thus have few, large trees; and areas that have been heavily invaded by weeds (Behnke et al. 2016).","The most recent population estimate is from 2012 when the number of individuals was estimated at 945 (460-1,547, 95% CI) (Paxton et al. 2016). This equates to approximately 310-1,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The species is endemic to Kaua`i in the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.). It was common throughout upper elevation forests in the late 19th century and was thought to be stable at c.20,650 individuals up until the mid 1990s, although its habitat declined in extent over this time period (USFWS 1983, Scott et al. 1986, Lepson and Pratt 1997, S. Fretz et al. in litt. 2003). However, in 2000, surveys indicated that the population had decreased to 7,839 ±704 individuals, which dropped to 5,669 ± 1,003 individuals in 2005, 3,536 ± 1,030 in 2007 and 945 individuals (460-1,547, 95% CI) in 2012 (Paxton et al. 2016). Even allowing for the large error estimates this indicates a dramatic decline (Holmer 2007, D. Kuhn per Holmer 2007, D. Pratt per Holmer 2007, VanderWerf 2007). It occurs at the highest density in the remote Alaka`i region, especially the southeastern part of this region (Behnke et al. 2016), and also occurs in the upper Waimea and Koke`e regions; an isolated population persisted in the Makaleha Mountains until at least the early 1970s (Scott et al. 1986, Lepson and Pratt 1997). In the core of its range its presence is associated with large trees and native shrub cover (Behnke et al. 2016).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions Underway Some of the current range is protected by Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve, Hono O Nā Pali Natural Area Reserve (NAR) and, to some extent, by Koke`e State Park. Portions of the Preserve have been/are being/will be included in ungulate proof fences in the next five years and post fence-completion, ungulates will be eradicated from these areas.

The accidental introduction of mammalian predators, non-native pest plants, insects or an avian disease, or a stochastic event such as a hurricane could rapidly bring about its extinction.","It occurs in low shrubs and grasses and is evenly distributed across the island (Morin et al. 1997, Gorresen et al. 2016). It feeds on seeds, invertebrates, other plant parts and eggs (Berger 1972, Morin and Conant 2002). It nests in cavities in cliffs, rock crevices or in piles of loose rock (Berger 1972, Morin and Conant 2002). The clutch size is usually three (range 2-5), but little is known about nesting behaviour or success. There is no information on adult survival or movements (VanderWerf 2012).","It is thought that the presence of the introduced grasshopper Schistocerca nitens on Nihoa, and its periodic irruptions which lead to the virtual defoliation of the island, may be a significant threat to the species. Other potential threats include the introduction of detrimental non-native species and diseases, as well as stochastic events (Berger 1972, James and Olson 1991, Morin et al. 1997, H. Baker and P. Baker in litt. 1999), such as droughts, storms and hurricanes. Black rats caused the extirpation of translocated Laysan Finches T. ultima when they arrived on Midway in 1944 (VanderWerf 2012). Fire is a past and potential threat (Morin et al. 1997, J. Lepson in litt. 1999). A few individuals of the invasive weed Cenchrus echinatus were discovered on Nihoa in 2011 and removed (VanderWerf et al. 2011), and little regrowth was observed in 2012 (VanderWerf 2012). This plant reduces habitat quality and so is a potential threat to the species. T. cantans is known to be highly susceptible to mosquito-borne avian poxvirus (Poxvirus avium) and avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum), and considering its close relationship T. ultima is presumably similarly susceptible. Mosquitoes are not known to occur on Nihoa or Laysan, but are present on Midway and all the larger Hawaiian islands and thus are relevant to selecting sites for translocations (VanderWerf 2012).","VanderWerf (2012) estimated 4,475 ±909 birds, which very roughly equates to 3,000 (2,400-3,600) mature individuals.

Visiting scientists make regular efforts to control one of the three species of alien plant on Nihoa by hand weeding (Morin et al. 1997). An attempted introduction to French Frigate Shoals in 1967 failed (Berger 1972). A process to evaluate and prioritise potential translocation sites throughout the archipelago for this species (and the other two Northwestern Hawaiian Island passerines) is currently underway. Disease susceptibility may preclude reintroduction of the Nihoa Finch to the Main Hawaiian Islands, and translocation efforts may focus on the Northwestern Islands.Conservation Actions ProposedContinue monitoring, and establish a captive-breeding programme (see Collar and Butchart 2013). Ensure strict protocols prevent further accidental introductions of alien species. Introduce a population to Kure Atoll and (following removal of mice and mosquitos) to Midway Atoll. Restore another island for future translocation. Ensure that the incipient population of Cenchrus echinatus is eradicated from Nihoa and continue to monitor for its presence (VanderWerf 2012).

No regular breeding, passage or wintering population is known, and the number of remaining individuals must be tiny. For these reasons the species qualifies as Critically Endangered.","Behaviour: This species is migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It is thought to breed in small colonies with nests between 2-3 m and 10-15 m apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Eggs have been found in May (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Early records often referred to the species as occurring in large flocks on migration and in winter. However, it is some decades since any sizeable flocks have been observed. The peak of the autumn migration appears to occur around September, with the spring migration peaking around March (Gretton 1991).Habitat: Breeding The only known nests were recorded in bog-forest transition zones (Gretton 1991) on the northern limit of the forest-steppe zone in habitat more typical of taiga marsh. This may represent either a very specialised breeding habitat requirement, or an unusual use of habitat at the limit of the species's breeding range (Gretton 1991). Non-breeding On migration and in winter, a wide variety of habitats are used, including saltmarsh, wet grassland, steppe grassland, fishponds, saltpans, brackish lagoons, tidal mudflats, semi-desert, brackish wetlands and sandy farmland next to lagoons. Large coastal wetland complexes may be especially characteristic, and most records come from close to the sea (Buchanan et al. 2010). Where it winters inland it inhabits marsh areas fed with freshwater, but with areas of Salicornia indicating that the ground has a high salt content (Gretton 1991).Diet: There is little information on its diet: birds at Merja Zerga (Morocco) fed on earthworms and tipulid larvae, while elsewhere insects (there is a suspiscion that orthoptera may have been an important food source [N. Crockford in litt. 2012]), molluscs and crustaceans have been recorded as prey. Breeding site: A nest found by Ushakov in 1914 was constructed of dry grass with a few leaves of rush Scirpus but little or no sedge (Gretton 1991). The known nests were situated on dry areas of sedge and bog moss some distance from willow scrub or birch grove (Gretton 1991). An analysis of stable isotopes in feather samples from museum skins suggest that the main breeding area was located further south than the historically confirmed sites; in the steppes of northern Kazakhstan and southern central Russia between 48°N and 56°N, with a core area around 50°N (Buchanan et al. 2018).","Threats on the breeding grounds are unknown. Within its potential breeding range, the taiga has been little modified, the forest-steppe partially cultivated and much of the steppe modified by agriculture. Habitat loss in the wintering grounds is of unknown importance. There has been extensive drainage of wetlands in the Mediterranean and North Africa and potentially important areas in Iraq. The conversion of European wetlands and central European steppes to arable farmland may have heavily impacted the species by depriving it of important habitats during migration (Gretton 1991). Historically hunting was high, and may have been the key factor in its decline. Following the initial decline, breakdown of social behaviour patterns may have prevented recovery. Historically a gregarious species, smaller groups or individuals may have difficulty in locating suitable stop-over sites on migration (Gretton 1991). Individuals may join flocks of N. arquata, being led to unsuitable wintering habitat and rendered unlikely to find a mate (Gretton 1991).","The population is assumed to be tiny (fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals) based on the lack of recent records. There are no recent confirmed sightings of this species within Europe, where it formerly regularly wintered. At the European level, it is classified as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) (BirdLife International 2015). A record of an individual at Druridge Bay, Northumberland (Great Britain) in May 1998 was not confirmed (Collinson et al. 2014).",Decreasing,"This species has only been confirmed breeding near Tara, north of Omsk in Siberia, Russia, between 1909-1925. It migrates west-south-west from its presumed breeding grounds through central and eastern Europe, predominantly Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and the former Yugoslavia to southern Europe, Greece, Italy, and Turkey, and North Africa, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. It has also been reported from Slovenia, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. Reports of birds staging in Ukraine persist but require confirmation. Regarded as very common in the early 19th century, it was already a rare bird by the 20th century, with regular records having dried up by the end of the century. Between 1980 and 1990, there were only 103 records involving 316-326 birds (BirdLife International 1999), and from 1990-1999, this dropped to 74 records involving 148-152 birds (BirdLife International 1999). Although there have been reports from Bulgaria, Ukraine and Uzbekistan of larger groups, most recent verified records have been of one to three birds, with the last nationally accepted record coming from Hungary in April 2001 (G. Buchanan and N. Crockford in litt. 2009, Oláh and Pigniczki 2010). In 1994, the population was estimated at only 50-270 individuals, but the paucity of recent confirmed records suggests it is now lower than 50 birds.","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I. CMS Appendix I and II. A Memorandum of Understanding, established under the auspices of the CMS, came into effect in 1994, and a working group was established in 1998 (Gallo-Orsi and Boere 2001). An international action plan was published in 1996. National action plans are in place in Italy (Nagy and Crockford 2004), Bulgaria and Ukraine. Several of the sites within the EU where the species has been recorded are designated as Special Protection Areas. There have been several international initiatives to survey passage and wintering sites (van der Have et al. 2001, Azafzaf and Feltrup-Azafzaf 2003, T. R. Cleeves in litt. 2006) and potential breeding areas (Gallo-Orsi and Boere 2001, Gretton et al. 2002), collate records (Gallo-Orsi and Boere 2001), protect key sites, raise public awareness (Azafzaf and Feltrup-Azafzaf 2003) and educate hunters. Details of a 'last push' to locate any remaining populations (focusing initially on surveys of historical wintering areas) were announced at the Ninth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Migratory Species in December 2008 (BirdLife International 2008, Crockford 2009, RSPB 2010). Surveys across the potential non-breeding range (from Morocco, perhaps as far as Japan) took place in 2009-11 with a particular focus on wintering and potential moult sites (G. Buchanan and N. Crockford in litt. 2012). The Slender-billed Curlew Working Group has developed a tool kit to assist people to identify and report Slender-billed Curlew in the field (available at: www.slenderbilledcurlew.net). If any can be found and caught then the sites used during the annual cycle could be determined by satellite tagging. An attempt to narrow down the search for breeding and moulting sites using stable isotope analysis and Strontium analysis of museum skins commenced in 2002 (Hilton 2003); results suggest that the main breeding area may have extended from southern central Russia into northern Kazakhstan (Nagy and Crockford 2004, G. Buchanan and N. Crockford in litt. 2012, Buchanan et al. 2018).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor key former and potential wintering and passage sites.

There are low rates of nest survival, with nests with a great amount of vegetation around the nest cavity having the greatest survial rates (Berl et al. 2014). It is strongly aggressive, particularly when defending food storage sites, and is interspecifically territorial against the Red-bellied Woodpecker M. carolinus (Reller 1972). It is omnivorous, eating a high proportion of animal matter in spring, but seeds predominate in winter. It breeds from April to September.","Habitat degradation, as a result of the removal of dead trees and branches in urban areas (Pulich 1988), and loss of nesting habitat to firewood cutting, clear cutting, agricultural development and river channelling in rural areas (Ehrlich et al. 1992, Melcher 1998), appears to be responsible for population decline. Collisions with moving vehicles may be a contributing factor, but persecution as a pest by farmers and utility companies is currently minimal (Smith et al. 2000, del Hoyo et al. 2002). Mortality events due to collisions with communication towers have been reported (Longcore et al. 2013), but the overall threat from this is unknown. The introduced Common Starling Sturnus vulgaris may also be a threat as they act as competitors for nest sites with Red-headed Woodpeckers (J. Berl in litt. 2016). Additionally, predation by the Sharp-shinned Hawk Accipiter striatus and warmer winter temperatures might play a role in the decline of the Red-headed Woodpecker (Koenig et al. 2017).","The population size has not been quantified, but is estimated to number &gt;10,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Melanerpes erythrocephalus is found in central and eastern USA, from Montana to the Atlantic coast and south to the Gulf of Mexico, and in extreme southern Canada (del Hoyo et al. 2002).

Evaluate migration ecology and habitat use during breeding and non-breeding seasons (J. Berl in litt. 2016). Use fire for its positive effects - prescribed burning and understorey thinning increased numbers in Arkansas by creating more open forest stands, improving foraging opportunities; however, whilst burning may create nest-snags, it also destroys existing nest-snags. Creation or maintenance of snags for nesting and roosting is of prime importance. Snags should be retained, in groups if possible. Dead branches should be retained on big trees in non-urban areas and only selectively pruned where hazardous in urban areas. Additionally, retain partially dead trees with some live vegetation as these appear to be important for nesting success (e.g. Berl et al. 2014). Selective thinning of live trees appears to have a positive effect (e.g. removal of 50% of oak trees for prairie restoration on a reserve in Ohio immediately attracted nesting birds); and removal of shade tolerant trees could be of particular benefit in restoring open understorey savanna or parkland (J.

The rate of the decline is difficult to asses but assumed to be at least 25% over three generations (10.5 years). Therefore, the species is precautionarily listed as Near Threatened, but might warrant a further category change if new information on population trends becomes available.","Throughout its breeding range, the species occupies boreal spruce and fir forests. Being a long-distance migrant, it leaves the breeding sites in northern North America in August and arrives to the wintering grounds in northern South America by September/October (DeLuca et al. 2013). There, it occurs east of the Andes (below 3,000 m) in a variety of habitats, including lowland forest, cloudforest, secondary growth, forest edges and plantations (Curson 2018). By April, the species migrates back to the breeding range, where it arrives mid-May/June (DeLuca et al. 2013). Insects are the predominant food source, supplemented with fruits during migration (Curson 2018).","Given its wide range of habitat use in the non-breeding range, forest loss and degradation there is not thought to be a key threat (DeLuca et al. 2013). The remote nature of its breeding range would also appear to make logging there unlikely to be a significant threat too (DeLuca et al. 2013). The species is frequently reported as suffering mortality by colliding with large structures during migration, but this in part could be a result of the species’s abundance, and so the impacts of this on its overall population dynamics may in fact be trivial (DeLuca et al. 2013). The species’s breeding range is likely being affected by climate change. The area of the breeding range is predicted to expand by 2080 following a shift poleward (Ralston and Kirchman 2013). Yet, this shift potentially brings other species into competition with the Blackpoll Warbler, and turn lower-elevational areas into population sinks (DeLuca et al. 2013). In fact, modelling has suggested a three degree rise in average temperature could lead to the loss of nearly all high-elevation conifer habitat in the species’s breeding region (Rodenhouse et al. 2008).","The population is estimated at around 59,000,000 mature individuals, equating roughly to 88,500,000 individuals in total (Rosenberg et al. 2016).

Eggs have been recorded from May to July, though the precise timing varies slightly throughout its range. A clutch of two to seven eggs is laid, and extra-parental co-operation is well established. It is present in North America until September (del Hoyo et al. 1999). When breeding, this species is readily associated with urban environments, although it will forage over a range of habitat types. Main habitats include river-edge forest, the edge of tropical lowland evergreen forest and second-growth scrub. It can also be found along the coast in Peru, up to 3,000 m over irrigated farmland in western Andean valleys, and even in central city zones (del Hoyo et al. 1999). Spiders, along with Hymenoptera spp., Diptera spp. and other insects have been recorded in its diet (del Hoyo et al. 1999).","In recent times, the number of available chimneys has decreased as a result of the demolition of old buildings, the capping of old chimneys and through chimney sweeps removing nests from chimneys (despite the species being protected by federal law) (COSEWIC 2007, R. Windingstad in litt. 2010, Steeves et al. 2014). Even though a scarcity of chimneys may not be limiting the numbers of Chimney Swifts yet (Wake 2016, Stewart et al. 2017), the rate of habitat loss is increasing and possibly developing into a severe threat (C. Artuso in litt. 2018). Logging of old-growth forest may also reduce the number of breeding sites for the species (Steeves et al. 2014). It is projected that very few suitable sites will remain within the next thirty years (COSEWIC 2007). The number of breeding sites in Quebec is limited, and it is estimated that only 60% of breeding-age adults actually reproduce; a trend which is thought to be replicated across Canada (COSEWIC 2007). Additionally, the use of DDT in the 1950s to control insect populations may have caused a shift in Chimney Swift diet, although the long term impact on the species is uncertain (Nocera et al. 2012, Steeves et al. 2014). Hurricanes during the migration period and harsh weather conditions during the breeding season have caused a considerable number of deaths (COSEWIC 2007, Dionne et al. 2008). In its South American wintering area, the species is threatened by intensive logging operations and by fires (COSEWIC 2007). Overall, the key threat is thought to be the ongoing loss of potential nesting sites (although this may not be the case for all populations; Fitzgerald et al. 2014).","The global population has been estimated at 15,000,000 individuals in total (Rich et al. 2004) and 7,700,000 mature individuals, based on estimates from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (Rosenberg et al. 2016) .",Decreasing,"Chaetura pelagica breeds in eastern North America from southern Canada and to the Gulf Coast states of the USA, and occasionally in California and Arizona.

Most populations appear to have stabilized or increased since 1995, but the effects of drought and the increasing demand for both fossil fuel and renewable energy development (including wind and biofuels) continue to place remaining habitats at risk. Therefore, the species is precautionarily retained as Vulnerable, because of potential future declines, although if these do not materialise the species will warrant downlisting to a lower threat category.","It originally inhabited mid-grass prairie with or without interspersed Shinnery Oak Quercus havardii or Sand Sagebrush Artemisia filifolia (Hagen et al. 2002, Wolfe et al. 2007). It is now most common in dwarf shrub-mixed grass vegetation, sometimes interspersed with short grass and, optimally, with some portion (&lt;25%) of the landscape in row grains as supplemental winter forage. Successful nests tend to be in areas with greater shrub cover and visual obstructions (Davis 2009), and habitat occupancy increases with native land cover (Hagen et al. 2016). Leks are usually on elevated areas with short vegetation (Wolfe et al. 2007). Breeding occurs from mid-March to late May (Wolfe et al. 2007). Food comprises foliage, seeds, grain, insects in the warmer months and acorns in the south of the range (Wolfe et al. 2007). Birds flock in late autumn and early winter, when they feed in croplands (Wolfe et al. 2007).","Croplands have expanded since the late 19th century and complete conversion is now the principal threat (Hagen et al. 2002, Wolfe et al. 2007), as areas with more than 37% cultivated land are probably unsustainable (Hagen et al. 2002). Intensive grazing reduces food and cover, and herbicides reduce shrub cover and acorn production (Wolfe et al. 2007). Market hunting greatly reduced populations in the early 20th century (Wolfe et al. 2007). Conversion of prairies to woodlands from the lack of fire is one of the primary threats facing the species, yet this threat can be reversed through proactive land management that includes the use of prescribed fire at biologically appropriate intervals (Hagen and Elmore 2016). Yet fire could also threaten the species in the short-term at the local level, as 780,000 acres of habitat was destroyed by fire in 2017, and populations in these areas were concurrently impacted (Belinda et al. 2017). However, populations will likely be improved in the future as a result of this (Belinda et al. 2017). Numbers declined more severely in the dust bowl of the late 1930s, and significantly with droughts in the 1950s and early 1990s (Wolfe et al. 2007). Recent droughts have also impacted the species (North American Grouse Partnership in litt. 2018, R. Rodgers in litt. 2018), decreasing chick and juvenile survival (Ross et al. 2018).Today, recreational hunting is limited to Kansas and the conservative seasons produce an annual harvest of fewer than 1,000 birds (Wolfe et al. 2007, Van Pelt et al. 2013). In Oklahoma, 39.5% of the prairie-chicken mortality recorded was due to fence collisions, while in New Mexico, this figure was 26.5%. The species has also been found to avoid power lines, and so it is likely that the erection of other tall structures (including wind turbines) will lead to increased habitat fragmentation and reduced home range sizes (Pruett et al. 2009) as well as reduced reproductive success (Pitman et al. 2005). Wind-energy facilities are increasing in the Great Plains, particularly in states with Lesser Prairie-chickens, as these have the highest potential for wind energy development. If climate change should lead to increased temperatures within the species's range, this could also impact the species as it has been found that nest survival decreases 10% for every half-hour when temperature exceed 34°C (Grisham et al. 2016).","The global population is estimated to number 22,000-41,000 individuals (McDonald et al. 2015).",Decreasing,"Tympanuchus pallidicinctus occurs in west-central and south-west Kansas, south-east Colorado, the Oklahoma panhandle, Texas (Permian Basin) and eastern New Mexico, (U.S.A.), and historically perhaps in southern Nebraska (Wolfe et al. 2007).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is legally protected in all range states. Numbers of leks and attending males are monitored via ground and aerial surveys (McDonald et al. 2014, Garton et al. 2016 [per C. Hagen in litt. 2016], J. Haufler in litt. 2012). Reintroduction programs have failed in Texas and Colorado (Wolfe et al. 2007). Some grazing regimes have been successfully manipulated, and croplands have reverted to roughly 2 million acres of grassland under the Conservation Reserve Program and other private land management schemes, which have benefited several populations (Hagen et al. 2002). Large areas of habitat have been purchased by some states and the Nature Conservancy and Candidate Conservation Agreements with Assurances are being implemented in Texas and Oklahoma (J. Haufler in litt. 2012). Research has been conducted on the species's ecology and conservation, which will facilitate the production of recovery plans. Miles of unneeded fences have been removed in parts of Oklahoma and Texas and a method has been developed to mark remaining fences to reduce mortality (Rogers 1997). WAFWAs conservation efforts have resulted in 53,000 ha of conservation offsetting and LPCI has enrolled 450 landowners and 430,000 ha in conservation actions to benefit the species since 2010 (C. Hagen in litt. 2016).Conservation Actions ProposedAllow habitat regeneration, and manage grazing to provide adequate cover and forage for prairie chickens. Continue to manage occupied habitats on private lands, and hasten progress towards effective management on public lands. Actions may include removal of invasive woody species, improved grazing systems, reintroduction of fire to the landscape, and minimize human developments in these areas (C. Hagen in litt. 2016). Protect occupied habitats. Develop and promote effective incentives for land-owners to maintain populations and their habitat. Continue monitoring leks and develop statistically robust methods of estimating populations from lek data. Regulate the construction of tall structures in or near lesser prairie-chicken habitats. Ensure effective evaluation and mitigation of the impacts of wind turbine (and all other energy development [C.

It forages in deep water, usually far offshore, and concentrating on areas with dense aggregations of zooplankton (e.g. areas of converging currents or upwellings). It usually occurs in large flocks. Its diet comprises mainly planktonic crustaceans and infrequently small fish and squid. Individuals arrive at colonies between March and May, with the peak laying time varying depending on locality. Individuals are monogamous with high mate and site fidelity, and both sexes prefer mates with larger crests. Nest density in its sometimes large colonies (over 100,000 pairs) is determined by the availability of suitable rock crevices and cavities for nesting. Outside the breeding season it remains in the north-west Pacific (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","The species is sensitive to climate change, with chick survival being closely linked to dietary supplies of large zooplankton, whose range may be shifting in response to climatic changes, especially in the rapidly warming Bering Sea (Kitaysky and Golubova 2000). In 1996, the species was the most frequently harvested seabird in Alaska, with indigenous peoples permitted to hunt at any time. Despite c. 12,310 birds harvested per annum, this only amounts to a very small proportion of total population and has negligible effects on its trend. Introduced predators pose a threat in certain part of the species’ range with Arctic Vulpes lagopus and Red Foxes V. vulpes being introduced to 450 Aleutian islands by 1930 for fur farming and resulting in massive impacts on local bird populations. Following bird population collapses and eradication efforts, foxes were constrained to only 46 islands by 1996 (Veitch and Clout 2002).

It survived the defoliation of Laysan by introduced rabbits, apparently by feeding on bird eggs, persistent seeds and carrion (Berger 1972, M. Morin in litt. 1999, 2003). On Laysan Island it nests almost exclusively in bunchgrass Eragrostis variabilis, but on Pearl and Hermes Atoll where bunchgrass is uncommon, the introduced birds nest in other plants or in man-made debris that floats ashore (M. Morin in litt. 1999, 2003).","Today, the primary forces regulating this species's population are storms and drought, which can cause almost total nest failure (Morin 1992a). Global warming is a further cause for concern, given that the maximum altitude on Laysan is only 12 m and that, as well as predicted sea-level rises of 0.5-2.0 m by 2100, the frequency and severity of hurricanes and droughts are expected to increase as a consequence (McNeely et al. 1995, Moulton and Marshall 1996). In the past, invasive alien plants have reduced nesting habitat (Gagné 1988, Morin et al. 1997, M. Morin in litt. 1999, 2003). Additional potential threats include the accidental introduction of non-native plants, animals and diseases (M. Morin in litt. 1999, 2003).

Conant in litt. 2007). On Midway Island, an introduced population succumbed to rats during the 1940s (Fisher and Baldwin 1946). In 1903, the introduction of rabbits to Laysan led to a serious decline in population size, but the species recovered rapidly after the rabbits were exterminated in 1923. The population numbered 1,000 individuals in 1928, c.5,000 in 1951 (Berger 1972), and apparently fluctuated between 5,000 and 20,000 over the period 1968-1990, with a mean of 11,044 (M. Morin in litt. 1999, 2003); this apparent fluctuation may be due, at least in part, to differing methods and seasons of censuses (Morin and Conant 1994). There has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of Laysan Finch on Southeast Island, at Pearl and Hermes Reef, since the successful invasion of golden crown beard Verbesina encelioides, which provides sheltered nesting habitat and additional food.

Natural populations found in Greenland are mainly migratory, wintering in the southern states of the U.S.A. and along coasts of North America (Carboneras et al. 2014).

The return migration begins in April or May, the species moving to spring staging areas where it may be present for 20-30 days before migrating northwards (Kear 2005a). The species is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season, often feeding in dense concentrations on coastal grasslands during the winter (Madge and Burn 1988). In winter habitats it roosts on water (Madge and Burn 1988) or on sandbanks near saltmarshes and pastureland (Peberdy 1991). Habitat Breeding The species breeds in Arctic semi-desert tundra (fjellmark) (Kear 2005a)on crags, rocky outcrops (del Hoyo et al. 1992), cliffs, rocky slopes (Johnsgard 1978) and coastal islands (Svalbard) (Kear 2005a) near wetlands such as lakes, rivers, marshes, the upper parts of fjords, coastlines (Johnsgard 1978), wet meadows and mudflats (Kear 2005a). In years when the snow is slow to melt the species first forages on grassy vegetation on south-facing mountain slopes fertilised by the droppings of cliff-nesting seabirds before moving down to breeding areas (Kear 2005a). It also returns to these slopes after the moulting period before autumn migration (Kear 2005a). After the young hatch families may disperse away from rocky ground to more vegetated areas surrounding tundra lakes and rivers (Kear 2005a). Non-breeding During the non-breeding season the species frequents tidal mudflats, saltmarshes (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005a) and adjacent coastal meadows (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992) (especially improvedrough pasturesand arable land (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a)), with agricultural fields becoming increasingly more important as winter feeding areas (Scott and Rose 1996). Diet The species is herbivorous (del Hoyo et al. 1992) its diet consisting of the leaves, stems and seed-heads of grasses, sedges, aquatic plants (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a), mosses (Kear 2005a), various herbs (especially white clover Trifolium repens in the winter) (Peberdy 1991, Vickery and Gill 1999) and shrubs (e.g. arctic willow Salix arctica) (Johnsgard 1978). It may also take agricultural grain and vegetables during the winter (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression in a low mound of vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998) positioned on rocky ground (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005a), rocky outcrops (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998), among rocky crags, on steep cliffs (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, Snow and Perrins 1998), on the tops of low hills (Johnsgard 1978), or on low vegetation hummocks and snow-free patches on islands in river channels (Snow and Perrins 1998). Nesting sites accumulate nesting materials as they are often used year after year (Johnsgard 1978), and the species may sometimes nest among seabird colonies (Madge and Burn 1988). Management information An investigation carried out in one of the species's wintering areas (UK) found that it was most likely to forage on improved grasslands with high abundances of the grass Lolium perenne and white clover Trifolium repens (Vickery and Gill 1999) (the growth of which is greatly influenced by the amount of summer grazing, which controls the grass height) (Peberdy 1991). Preferred fields were between 4 and 10 ha in area (the species avoided fields of less than 2-3 ha), and at an optimal distance of less than 5 km away from roosting sites (maximum 7 km away) (Vickery and Gill 1999). The species was also found to show a preference for grasslands with swards less than 10 cm in height (optimum 2 cm) in fields that had been cut for silage and then grazed (although there was no major difference in feeding intensity on pastures grazed with different livestock) (Vickery and Gill 1999). Overall winter use of grassland fertilised with large amounts of nitrogen was significantly greater than the use of unfertilised grassland by the species (Vickery and Gill 1999). The Barnacle Goose Management Scheme (BGMS) in Scotland, UK recommends fertilising farmland adjacent to reserves containing wintering groups of this species at times when geese are present (e.g. autumn or winter) and grazing stock (sheep or cattle) are absent (Cope et al. 2003). The BGMS also awards payments to farmers who manage pastures outside of established reserves for reducing the level of disturbance (e.g. scaring away feeding flocks) on their land (Cope et al. 2003).","Today the species is fully protected throughout its range, although adults, eggs and down were once exploited by humans (Kear 2005a), and the species may be disturbed by shooting even though it is not directly hunted (Peberdy 1991). The species faces possible threats from persecution (disturbance) by farmers as in winter it favours grasslands and pastures used for grazing livestock (Cope et al. 2003). The species also suffers from nest predation by arctic fox Vulpes lagopus in Svalbard (Madsen et al. 1992).","The global population is estimated at c. 880,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

The precise timing of its spring arrival at breeding colonies is variable depending on locality, from late February on Franz Josef Land to early May in north-west Greenland. Immense colonies are formed on sea coasts, usually nesting in crevices in rock scree of maritime slopes and on coastal cliffs. Colonies are abandoned in August with individuals seeking more southerly waters (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","As Little Auks spend much of their life at sea, including at and below the sea surface, they are vulnerable to both oil spill events and chronic oil pollution (Fort et al. 2013). The Newfoundland area is subject to chronic oil pollution, with tens of thousands of Little Auks dying in this area annually (Wiese and Robertson 2004). Recent tracking research has indicated that important foraging grounds for the species overlap with expanding oil and gas extraction activities and shipping, which could lead to habitat degradation and species mortality (Fort et al. 2013). The Little Auk is still hunted in Thule during its short period of presence in the summer, to form the delicacy Kiviaq, now only eaten at important celebrations. It is thought that, in the 1990s, annual take in Greenland was c. 60,000 birds which, due to the global population numbering over 30 million, is not thought to cause significant declines. There is also evidence for mortality due to bycatch, however, estimates for the combined bycatch of all auk species in the Northeast Atlantic is in the thousands (Fangel et al. 2015), so this is unlikely to be causing declines. It has been found that Little Auks’ reproductive output and body condition is unaffected by the retreat of sea-ice, due to the use of bathymetric features for foraging, meaning this species will be largely unaffected by the retreat of sea-ice in response to climate change. Further research shows Little Auks are able to switch to feeding in nutrient rich coastal glacier melt-water in cases where sea-ice is absent, maintaining chick growth but showing a 4% decrease in adult body mass (Grémillet et al. 2015). There is some dispute as to whether changing sea surface temperature will have an effect on the Little Auk. It has been found that foraging plasticity allows Little Auks to feed on the smaller and less lipid-rich copepods found in warmer water without a reduction in fledging success or adult body condition, although this is thought to be at the expense of energy expenditure on other activities (Grémillet et al. 2012). In contrast to this, Hovinen et al. (2014) found adult survival to be negatively correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation index and local summer sea surface temperatures with a time lag of 2 and 1 years respectively, implying climate change may have a negative effect on the Little Auk population.","The global population is estimated to number c.16,000,000-36,000,000 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996).

It breeds on maritime and inland grassy slopes, sometimes on predator-free islands, and rarely on steep island or mainland cliffs. It occurs in large aggregations at sea, often forming dense roosting flocks at night in sheltered bays. In winter it is normally pelagic in waters offshore from breeding areas and sometimes in near-shore coastal waters where food is highly concentrated due to oceanographic conditions. Diet: It feeds mostly on fish throughout the year supplemented in winter by small amounts of invertebrates such as squid and krill. Chicks are fed almost exclusively on fish, though invertebrates may also be given to late-hatching young. Breeding: It arrives at colonies in late March and early April, laying from the end of April to mid-June. It is monogamous with high site and mate fidelity. It is highly colonial in small to very large concentrations (sometimes over 100,000 individuals). Laying is often highly asynchronous within a colony. Birds lay in nest chambers at the end of a burrow which are excavated by both sexes (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","The ongoing decline has been attributed mainly to the ecosystem effects resulting from climate change, including the impact of long-term changes in sea surface temperatures and altered timing and intensity of upwelling (Gaston et al. 2009). Interaction with commercial fisheries poses another significant threat. In the 1980s, c. 5,000 birds were annually captured in the salmon gill-net fishery off Japan, with further mortality in gillnets off Washington and British Columbia (Gaston and Dechesne 1996). Predation by non-native species may be contributory to decline in certain parts of the species’ range; Arctic Fox Vulpes lagopus have caused population declines in Alaska, on islands where there were introduced for hunting (Gaston and Dechesne 1996), rats Rattus spp. have impacted populations in Russia (Gaston and Dechesne 1996) and raccoons Procyon lotor were introduced to the Queen Charlotte Islands in the early 1940s, with the support of the Provincial Game Commission, and likely caused the extirpation of the colony on Saunders Island and dramatically reduced the population on Helgesen Island (Gaston and Deschesne 1996). Individuals of this species are regularly found oiled and is evidently susceptible to oil spills, though the levels of mortality remain unclear.","The global population is estimated to number &gt; c.1,300,000 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996), while national population estimates include: &lt; c.1,000 wintering individuals in Korea; c.10,000-1 million breeding pairs c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in Japan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"The Rhinoceros Auklet is found in the North Pacific and breeds from California, USA, off the coasts of Canada and Alaska to the Aleutian Islands in North America; and on Hokkaido and Honshu, Japan, as well as on the northern tip of North Korea, Sakhalin (Russia) and at two places on the far eastern Siberian coast in Asia (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The species breeds from May onwards, nesting later further to the north depending on the timing of the thaw (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It usually nests solitarily on smaller waters but may nest in loosely colonial groups on larger waters (e.g. several pairs nesting a few metres apart on the same lake) (Snow and Perrins 1998). On migration, large flocks of 200-1,200 individuals may form, with similar concentrations occurring on rich marine fishing grounds during the winter (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species is most commonly observed singly, in pairs or in small scattered flocks during this season however (Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on freshwater pools or lakes in open moorland, blanket bogs or open and wet peatland habitats (Campbell 1987, del Hoyo et al. 1992). It will nest on pools as small as 10-20 m long or on lakes up to 5 ha in area, showing a preference for those in treeless areas that have well-vegetated margins and low islets or promontories on which to nest (Snow and Perrins 1998). It generally avoids waters with dense floating or emergent vegetation and steep rocks above the water, and if feeding conditions are inadequate in the pool chosen for breeding the species may fly to the coast or to lakes with higher abundances of fish in order to feed (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season, the species frequents inshore waters along sheltered coasts, occasionally occurring inland on lakes, pools, reservoirs and rivers (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans, molluscs, frogs, fish spawn, aquatic insects, annelid worms and plant matter (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding site The nest is a small depression or a mound of plant matter, built in shallow water up to 10 m from the shore or very near the water's edge, on islets or small promontories (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Nesting pairs will often re-use the same site in successive years (Snow and Perrins 1998).","Highly vulnerable to oil spills, especially in wintering areas where large concentrations form (e.g. on rich fishing grounds) (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Climate change is likely to result in a large shift in the North American summer range, possibly resulting in a decrease in the amount of suitable habitat. The Red-throated Loon has been found to be frequently caught as bycatch in studies in the Baltic (Schirmeister 2003, Zydelis et al. 2013) and in the northwest Atlantic (Warden 2010). A small study in the German Baltic found 370 drowned birds over 12 winters (HELCOM 2013). This species also has a strong reaction to disturbance from ships and helicopters, resulting in an altered population distribution and habitat fragmentation. It is considered to be a species at relatively high risk of collision with wind turbines and other offshore infrastructure due to nocturnal flight behaviour and low manoeuvrability (Garthe and Hüppop 2004).","The global population is estimated to number c.200,000-600,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015), while national population estimates include: c.50-10,000 wintering individuals in Japan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in Russia (Brazil 2009).

It favours mixed farmland, parks and gardens, churchyards, wooded steppe, quarries and coastal cliffs (Madge and de Juana 2014). Across Europe it is only absent from high mountain plateaux, tundra, extensive wetland or afforested areas and a few small islands (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species forms a long term pair bond. Egg-laying occurs from late April in Britain and northern Europe, mid-April in central Europe, and the first half of May in north-west Russia, central Asia and Kashmir. The nest varies in size, but can be massive as a fresh nest is built each year on top of older ones. The foundation is a mass of branches and twigs, interspersed with mud and dung and the inner cup is quite deep and thick and constructed of mosses, rotten wood, feathers and fur and wool, usually in some cavity of some kind. Clutches can be from three to eight eggs but usually four. It feeds mostly on the ground and is omnivorous. During the breeding season it is mainly carnivorous, feeding on a wide variety of invertebrates, eggs and household scraps (Madge and de Juana 2014).

It generally avoids wooded areas and xeric habitats, with taiga representing a barrier in the north of Eurasia and deserts and arid steppes a barrier in the south. Breeding occurs from late March or early April to August and September in most of the range. It is monogamous but the female builds the nest alone. It is in an excavated scrape or natural depression on the ground among short vegetation filled with a thick layer of grass and lined with finer vegetation. Clutches are normally three to five eggs. It feeds on invertebrates, seeds and other plant material. The diet is seasonal; primarily insectivorous in summer and herbivorous in the winter (Donald and Garcia 2014). The species is predominantly resident but with some short-distance dispersive movement in western and southern Europe and across the southern and eastern limits of the range in Asia. Birds in northern and central Europe and across much of Asia migrate after breeding (Donald and Garcia 2014).","The main cause of decline in this species is agricultural intensification. Recent research indicates the principal causes are changes in management of cereal-growing and grassland (leading to reduced nesting and foraging opportunities, and diminution of food resources (Donald and Garcia 2014). In grasslands high fertiliser applications lead to vegetation that is too tall and dense for nesting. The heavy use of pesticides and herbicides is thought to negatively impact this species too (Tucker and Heath 1994). High hunting pressure in some countries poses an additional threat (Donald and Garcia 2014).","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number 44,300,000-78,800,000 pairs, which equates to 88,700,000-158,000,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Europe forms c.30% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 295,600,000-526,600,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. National population estimates include: c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in China; &lt; c.50 individuals on migration and &lt; c.50 wintering individuals in Taiwan; c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in Korea; c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in Japan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex II.

It breeds from April or May (later in northern populations) (Kear 2005), in single pairs or colonies (del Hoyo et al. 1992), on islands or small islets, adults often assembling in groups on beaches when not at the nest (even when nesting solitarily) (Kear 2005). Males leave the breeding grounds in June to moult in small groups along the coast (Scott and Rose 1996), often considerable distances from the breeding areas (Snow and Perrins 1998) (although there is no evidence for any major migrations to common moulting sites) (Johnsgard 1978). The autumn migration begins in September (Scott and Rose 1996) and the species returns from the wintering grounds as early as February (Scott and Rose 1996). It is gregarious during the winter and on migration (Kear 2005), flocks of up to a hundred or more occurring in suitable sites during the autumn (although it travels in much smaller flocks during the spring) (Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding The species breeds along the wooded shorelines (Kear 2005) of deep lakes (del Hoyo et al. 1992), small rivers and streams (del Hoyo et al. 1992) with moderate currents (Snow and Perrins 1998) in the tundra, boreal and temperate forest zones (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005), as well as on more saline waters such as sheltered shallow bays, inlets, straits or estuaries with sandy rather than muddy substrates (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for narrow channels rather than open expanses of water, with islands or islets and spits, projecting rocks or grassy banks (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding The majority of the species winters at sea (del Hoyo et al. 1992), frequenting both inshore and offshore waters, estuaries, bays and brackish lagoons (del Hoyo et al. 1992), but showing a preference for clear, shallow waters not affected by heavy wave action (Johnsgard 1978). It will also utilise large freshwater lakes on passage (Madge and Burn 1988). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of small, shoaling marine or freshwater fish (del Hoyo et al. 1992), as well as small amounts of plant material (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and aquatic invertebrates (del Hoyo et al. 1992), such as crustaceans (e.g. shrimps and crayfish) (Johnsgard 1978), worms and insects (Kear 2005). Breeding site The nest is constructed within 25 m of water (Kear 2005) in a variety of locations such as natural cavities on the ground (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005), burrows (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005), under boulders (Madge and Burn 1988), amongst tree or scrub roots (Snow and Perrins 1998), in tree cavities, artificial nestboxes (Madge and Burn 1988), amongst reeds, or on floating reed mats (Flint et al. 1984). Where tree cavities or artificial nestboxes are utilised, the species shows a preference for those with entrances c.10 cm in diameter and with internal diameters of 30-40 cm (Johnsgard 1978). Management information The breeding density of this species increased on islands in the outer archipelago of south-west Finland as a result of feral American mink Neovison vison removal (Nordstrom et al. 2002). The species will also nest in artificial nestboxes with entrances c.10 cm in diameter and with internal diameters of 30-40 cm (Johnsgard 1978).","The species is subject to persecution and may be shot by anglers and fish-farmers who perceive it as a competitor and accuse it of depleting their fish stocks (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005). The level of impact from direct persecution is currently unknown (Craik et al. 2015). The species is also hunted in North America (Kear 2005) and Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006), although it appears to be a less popular game species (Kear 2005). Eggs used to be, and possibly still are, harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).It may also threatened by accidental entanglement and drowning in fishing nets (Kear 2005). Alterations to its breeding habitats by dam construction and deforestation, and habitat degradation from water pollution could represent threats (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species is susceptible to avian influenza and may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). However, all of these threats may not have significant impacts on the species overall at the moment.","The global population is estimated to number c.495,000-605,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016). The European population is estimated at 70,100-120,000 pairs, which equates to 140,000-240,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Stable,"This species breeds in most of the northern North America, south to the Great Lakes, in Greenland (to Denmark), Iceland, and much of northern Eurasia south to the United Kingdom, parts of Eastern Europe, north-east China and northern Japan.

The species arrives on its breeding areas between March and May (Scott and Rose 1996), actually breeding as early as late-March (although often considerably later in more northerly regions) (Madge and Burn 1988). It breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo et al. 1992) of up to 8-10 individuals (Flint et al. 1984) (especially on islands that provide suitable nesting sites in lacustrine or coastal locations) (Johnsgard 1978). The males gather to moult after mating, often undertaking considerable moult migrations to flock on key waters (Madge and Burn 1988). Females also undergo a post-breeding moult on the breeding grounds during which they become flightless for around 1 month (Johnsgard 1978). The main migration to wintering areas largely occurs from October through to December (Scott and Rose 1996), mass departures being linked to the freezing of breeding and moulting areas (Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season the species is typically found in small parties, with groups of up to 70 individuals feeding together on shoals of fish during the winter (Kear 2005). Large flocks may also form on roosting waters (Madge and Burn 1988), the largest gatherings occurring during the autumn migration and winter months and numbering up to several thousands of individuals (Madge and Burn 1988) (1,000 to 10,000 on suitable waters) (Snow and Perrins 1998). On passage in the spring flocks are usually small however, with breeding pairs remaining in flocks until they reach the breeding grounds (Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on large clear freshwater lakes (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005), pools (del Hoyo et al. 1992), the upper reaches of rivers (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005) and streams (Kear 2005) in the boreal, montane (Kear 2005) and temperate forest zones (Johnsgard 1978). It requires waters with a fairly high productivity of fish (Kear 2005) surrounded by mature hard-wood trees with holes excavated by woodpeckers or natural cavities for nesting in (Kear 2005). Non-breeding The species winters on large unfrozen lakes, rivers, lagoons, brackish waters and marshes (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992), generally avoiding highly saline waters (Madge and Burn 1988) although it may move to estuaries, coastal lagoons and sheltered sea coasts with waters less than 10 m deep in particularly harsh winters (Scott and Rose 1996). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of fish (del Hoyo et al. 1992) less than 10 cm long (Kear 2005), but may also include aquatic invertebrates (such as molluscs, crustaceans, worms, and adult and larval insects), amphibians, small mammals and birds (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The species nests in holes excavated by large woodpeckers or natural cavities in mature hardwood trees (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005) with entry holes more than 15 m above the ground (Kear 2005). It shows a preference for cavities with openings c.12 cm wide and internal diameters of c.25 cm (Johnsgard 1978) in trees close to or up to 1 km away from water (Snow and Perrins 1998). When natural tree-nesting sites are not available (Johnsgard 1978) the species will use artificial nestboxes (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005) or may nest among tree roots in undercut banks, on cliff ledges (Kear 2005), in rock clefts (Flint et al. 1984) or in dense scrub or loose boulders on islands (Kear 2005). Sometimes several females may nest in the same tree (Madge and Burn 1988), especially on islands that provide suitable nesting sites in lacustrine or coastal locations (Johnsgard 1978). Management information Artificial nestboxes commonly used are 85-100 cm high with openings 50-60 cm from the base (Johnsgard 1978).","The species is subject to persecution by anglers and fish-farmers who perceive it as a competitor and accuse it of depleting their fish stocks (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Eradication efforts may lead to long-term depression of Goosander populations (with little improvement in fish survival rates) (Pearce et al. 2015). The species suffers occasional entrapment in freshwater fishing nets with mesh sizes greater than 5 cm, with records of bycatch from China (Quan et al. 2002). The species is also at risk from degradation of freshwater lakes resulting from drainage and petroleum pollution in Russia (Grishanov 2006) and acid rain in North America (Kear 2005). The species is susceptible to avian influenza and is at risk from future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Hunting occurs in North America (Kear 2005) and Russia (Grishanov 2006), but the Goosander is not a popular game bird (Kear 2005). Its eggs used to be, and possibly still are, harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979). Present harvesting levels are sufficiently low not to be driving declines.","The global population is estimated to number c.1,700,000-2,400,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

It breeds between May and July (although the exact timing varies with temperature and food availability) in solitary pairs or colonies of a few to several hundred pairs (usually 2-25) (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and remains gregarious throughout the year especially when roosting, foraging and on passage (Higgins and Davies 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species generally feeds within 3 km of breeding colonies, but may occasionally forage up to 50 km away (del Hoyo et al. 1996). On its wintering grounds in Antarctica, it may also forage in association with Antarctic Minke Whale Balaenoptera bonaerensis in the open ocean north of the pack-ice zone (Higgins and Davies 1996). Habitat Breeding The species breeds along northern coastlines and on inshore islands, as well as inland on tundra and forest-tundra (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for habitats with a vegetation cover of less than 40 %, nesting on sand or shingle beaches, ridges and spits, rocky ground and small islands in lakes and coastal lagoons (Flint et al. 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It may also nest on islets or banks along rivers, on swampy tundra and peatlands with bog hummocks and reed-covered flats, or on inland heaths, rough pastures, meadows and sedge grassland not far from water (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species also forages offshore, in ice-filled coastal bays or over wet tundra (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding On passage, it largely flies over open ocean, resting at sea on kelp, logs or flotsam, but may occur inland or along coastlines on beaches, reefs and spits (Higgins and Davies 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). During the winter, the species is pelagic, foraging at the edges of pack-ice, icebergs and ice-floes near shore (especially in channels between ice-floes) and up to 24 km offshore, often in association with Antarctic Minke Whale Balaenoptera bonaerensis (Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It also roosts on ice-floes and icebergs during this season (Higgins and Davies 1996). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans (especially planktonic species), molluscs, insects (e.g. caterpillars, Chironomidae) and earthworms (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It will also take berries in the early spring on arrival on its breeding grounds, but does not readily switch to other prey items when preferred prey supplies fail (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow scrape in sand, shingle or turf on beaches, ridges and spits, rocky ground, small islands in lakes, coastal lagoons and rivers, swampy tundra and peatlands with bog hummocks and reed-covered flats, or on inland heaths, rough pastures, meadows and sedge grassland not far from water (Flint et al. 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It will also nest on artificial structures (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","Arctic Tern colonies are threatened by invasive American Mink Neovison vison, which have been shown to reduce tern reproductive success through nest predation and increase the risks taken by adults in defending the nest (Nordström et al. 2004). It has been shown, however, that control measures are helping to reduce predation (Mavor et al. 2005) and the long-term removal of mink reduces risk taking by adults during nest defence (Nordström et al. 2004). Arctic Terns also suffer a loss of reproductive success due to egging, which is ongoing in some areas. In some areas, such as Belcher Island and Resurrection Bay, Alaska, egging may have caused the abandonment of colonies (Gilchrist and Robertson 1999, Griswold 2016), with the latter occurring after the reported harvesting of every Arctic Tern egg present in the colony (Griswold 2016). Arctic Terns are projected to lose 20-50% of their habitat due to the temperature changes linked to a doubling of CO2 (BirdLife International unpublished). Sandeel is a key prey item, and major breeding failures are caused by food shortage (Schreiber and Kissling 2005). Increasing sea temperatures in the North Sea have been linked to reduced sandeel recruitment, likely causing a population decline (Vigfusdottir et al. 2013). Low sandeel populations have been linked with breeding failure through abandonment of clutches and chick starvation (Vigfusdottir 2012).

Further, in some areas, sandeel populations are decreasing due to overfishing. Dispersal ability and carrying capacity of northern areas will dictate population dynamics of Arctic Tern.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","This species is exclusively marine, ranging along sea coasts and as far offshore as the continental shelf edge. It feeds chiefly on fish, squid and crustaceans throughout the year, supplemented by polychaetes and molluscs. Fish predominate during summer, with the main species varying with locality, and are usually caught close to the colony. Birds arrive at colonies in the spring, though the start of laying is variable depending on sea temperature, laying latest where the temperatures are lowest (e.g. early July in the high Arctic). It is a highly colonial species, usually forming immense aggregations on sea cliffs and narrow ledges. The extent and timing of post-breeding dispersal is largely determined by ice conditions and food availability. During the winter periods, the species can be found in large flocks at sea, likely related to the non-random distribution of winter prey (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","The Thick-billed Murre is vulnerable to changes in climate, with populations declining in response to sea surface temperature changes in excess of 0.8˚C, but increasing at moderate temperature increases (0.3-0.8˚C) (Irons et al. 2008). This is likely due to changes in prey availability and, as such, is aggravated by the loss of upper trophic level fish and whales due to food-web disruption (Irons et al. 2008). Hunting is unregulated in Greenland, Newfoundland and Labrador and is considered to have resulted in population declines, as shown for Greenland (Merkel et al. 2016). Mortality from bycatch has been widely reported throughout the range, especially in the salmon drift-net fishery, previously responsible for a very high rate of bycatch, although this has decreased in recent years with the introduction of new regulations and reduction of fishing effort (Gaston and Hipfner 2000).","The global population is estimated to number &gt;22,000,000 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The European population is estimated at 1,920,000-2,840,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Enhanced monitoring of major colonies is needed, particularly in Iceland, Spitsbergen and the Russian Arctic, where population size and status are inadequately known. Detailed assessment of impacts of overfishing by commercial fisheries is required, particularly of capelin, cod, herring and sand eels in the Barents Sea and Iceland. Continue and expand assessments of by-catch in gill-net fisheries, particularly in the north-east Atlantic. Tighter legislation and penalties (national and international) associated with oil pollution from offshore developments and transport should be developed.

It has therefore been uplisted to Vulnerable.","The species breeds on small, shallow fresh, brackish or slightly alkaline waters between 0.5 and 2 m deep and between 1 and 20 ha in area with rich floating, submergent and emergent vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Konter 2001, Fjeldså 2004). Habitats include small pools, marshes with patches of open water and secluded sections of larger lakes and rivers (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The nest is a platform of aquatic vegetation either floating and anchored to emergent vegetation, built from the lake bottom (where water is shallow) or built on rocks at water level (del Hoyo et al. 1992). In its wintering range, the species frequents coastal inshore waters up to 10-20 m in depth including sheltered bays, lagoons and estuaries (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Ogilvie and Rose 2003, Fjeldså 2004). It may also occur on large lake and river systems south of its breeding range (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Fjeldså 2004). Its diet consists predominantly of fish and invertebrates such as adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, dragonflies, mayflies, water bugs, damselflies and caddisflies), crustaceans (e.g. brine shrimp, cladocerans, amphipods, decapods, crayfish and crabs), molluscs and worms (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Konter 2001, Fjeldså 2004). Fish and crustaceans are more important components of the diet during the winter when the species is at sea (del Hoyo et al. 1992). This species is fully migratory and travels over land in stages on a broad front, some populations only moving short distances to the nearest ice-free coast (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Fjeldså 2004).","The majority of the breeding range of the species lies within areas used for forestry, which is believed to have significantly impacted the area of suitable breeding habitat available to Horned Grebes (Llimona et al. 2014). Afforestation can lead to hydrological changes that reduce the availability of invertebrate prey to the grebe, and climate change appears to be having similar impacts through the drying of wetlands leading to overgrowth by plants, especially in the southern part of the range (A. Mischenko in litt. 2017). Dams also impact habitat suitability, however, they are likely to only impact a small minority of the population and may also provide additional habitat in parts of the range. There has also been a loss of habitat to agricultural development and rural development across the range, for example more than ten percent of the overall five percent decrease in wetland area in the Prairies of Canada was due to land being built upon (COSEWIC 2009). Development is likely to also bring disturbance to the birds, which may cause nest abandonment (Stedman 2018). Despite this, the species' range remains very large and, as such, these threats are likely to only affect a small fraction of the population. Many freshwater sites throughout the breeding range have become eutrophied through agricultural run-off, which is thought to degrade the nutritional quality of the prey base and nutrient status of the water has been related to breeding success in Scotland (Summers et al. 2011). The introduction of large fish, such as the Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, to many inland water bodies is likely to result in resource competition for invertebrate and small fish prey (HELCOM 2013). It is not clear that trout are actually affecting a majority of the global population, as no impact detected in a study in Scotland (Summers et al. 2011) which indicated that pike was a more significant source of mortality.Horned Grebes are commonly caught and accidentally drowned in fishing nets (del Hoyo et al. 1992), with bycatch in nearshore gill-nets  a potential significant source of mortality in much of the range as they appear highly susceptible to capture (more so than seaduck when accoutning for abundance) (Zydelis et al. 2013). The species is also particularly vulnerable to oil spills in the marine environment during the winter (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Ogilvie and Rose 2003, Fjeldså 2004, COSEWIC 2009). While relatively large numbers have been reported killed by a single large event (Stedman 2018), only a small proportion of the global population would be impacted across the large winter distribution.","The global population is estimated to number c. 239,000-583,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2012). The European population is estimated at 6,400-9,200 pairs, which equates to 12,900-18,500 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Europe holds &lt;10% of the global population with a similar proportion in Asia.",Decreasing,"This species is found in the Palearctic and Nearctic. It breeds from Iceland and the Baltic to Kamchatka, Russia, wintering from the North Sea to the Caspian Sea and off Japan to China (Llimona et al. 2014).

EU Birds Directive Annex I. Bern Convention Appendix II. In Canada the western population (British Columbia to Ontario) is considered of Special Concern and the breeding population on the Magdalen Islands, Quebec is considered Endangered (COSEWIC 2009). An action plan for the population breeding on the Magdalen Islands, Canada has been developed (Environment Canada 2014). At a breeding lake in Scotland (Loch Ruthven) sedge beds are being extended to provide more nesting habitat for the species (Ogilvie and Rose 2003).Conservation and Research Actions ProposedIdentify sites of international importance for the species and implement site protection. Populations should be closely monitored to determine whether numbers are stable or whether local declines are symptomatic of more widespread problems. Conduct survey work to accurately ascertain the current population sizes of both subspecies. Marginal populations in north-western Europe which have shown strong historical fluctuations should also be monitored (O'Donnel and Fjeldså 1997). Stricter legislation on oil drilling and transport should be enforced and mitigation measures against bycatch in fisheries implemented.For the population breeding on the Magdalen Islands, Canada a series of approaches to conserving the species have been proposed (Environment Canada 2014) including: protect critical habitat; increase awareness of the species among the general public; work with land managers to protect important habitats and sites for the species; limit human disturbance; implement research into population dynamics and ecology including migration patterns; develop methods to reduce interspecific competition; work with partners in the U.S.A. where birds from the Magdalen Islands are likely to winter.",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Clutches are four to six eggs. It feeds on a range of seeds, buds and shoots of various plants, as well as some invertebrates (Clement and Christie 2016). The species is sedentary to migratory, with most populations likely being partially migratory (Snow and Perrins 1998).","Since the late 1970s numbers have declined in Britain owing to changes in agricultural practice, which is thought to have adversely affected supply of weed seeds (Clement and Christie 2016).

When the habitat passes this stage, birds move on (Curson et al 1994). All kinds of woodland and scrub are used during migration, and birds generally winter in secondary growth forest or forest edge with a good understorey (Curson et al 1994). Most records come from below 2,000 m, and right down to sea-level (Curson et al 1994). The well-hidden nest is usually on or close to the ground, and breeding takes place in May and June (Curson et al 1994).","Local declines correlate with advancing succession and reforestation, and the invasive range expansion of Blue-winged Warbler Vermivora pinus (Confer 1992). Other possible causes of population declines are loss of wintering habitat (especially forest edge and open woodland) through agricultural expansion and clearance for plantations, nest parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbird Molothrus ater and hybridisation with V. pinus (Confer 1992).",Rich et al.

In western Europe, it is most commonly found in deciduous and mixed woodland, well-vegetated suburbs, urban parks and gardens, moorland scrub, and offshore islands with very scanty cover. In North America it breeds primarily in boreal moist coniferous forest with extensive understorey, as well as on offshore islands with very stunted vegetation. In European Russia, egg-laying occurs from the second half of May; however in western Europe it begins late March or early April and a week or more later in central Europe. In Canada it breeds between May and July. The nest is a domed structure with a side entrance hole (Kroodsma et al. 2015) and is made of grass, leaves, moss and other vegetation, lined with feathers and hair (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is sited in a wide range of locations, often in dense vegetation but also in a cavity or crevice and will use artificial sites. Clutches can be three to nine eggs but most often five to eight. The diet is mostly invertebrates such as spiders (Araneae), beetles (Coleoptera), earwigs (Dermaptera) and orthopterans but it will also take small vertebrates, such as small fish, tadpoles and young frogs. The species is resident, migratory and partially migratory (Kroodsma et al. 2015).","Some island populations, which represent whole subspecies are very small and thus vulnerable; the designation of race hirtensis, on St Kilda (Scotland) in 1884 led to an increase in collecting activity, although there is no evidence this caused a significant decline.

It breeds during the boreal winter, as the specimens found so far on land and calling from burrows and nesting have been in the period December to May (Kawakami et al. 2012, Fjeldså 2013, Pyle et al. 2014). The nesting individuals recorded on Higashijima in February 2015 were found in a mosaic of scrub forest and grassland, consisting of Screw Pine Pandanus boninensis and Bonin Silver Grass Miscanthus boninensis (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015). The nest site was a burrow in grassland. The individual recorded on Midway Atoll in 1991 was found in a crevice in rocky habitat (Pyle et al. 2014). To date, it has only been found on small islands. It may co-utilize nesting sites with Bulwer's Petrel Bulweria bulwerii (Pyle et al. 2014).","Introduced Black Rats Rattus rattus pose a considerable threat to the species, being present on more than 20 islands in the Bonin group (Kawakami et al. 2012). On Higashijima Island, three carcasses of Bryan’s Shearwater were found that had been depredated by rats and it is suspected that the paucity of records of the species may be a result of rat predation (Kawakami et al. 2012, Fjeldså 2013). Predation of smaller seabirds by rats on Higashijima dramatically increased in 2005, attributed to a shift in the foraging behaviour of the rats (Kawakami et al. 2012). The Ministry of Environment responded to the mass depredation of small petrels by initiating a rat eradication program on Higashijima in 2008, which has apparently been successful, with no rats observed since 2010 (Kawakami et al. 2012). Rats are also absent from Kitanoshima Island, but remain in large parts of the species’ range. Eradication of rats from these islands would be necessary for these areas to be suitable as breeding locations (Kawakami et al. 2012, Fjeldså 2013). Invasive plant species, Casuarina equisetifolia and Leucaena leucocephala, may also have impacted breeding success on Higashijima, as they invade the breeding habitat and alter the environment (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015). The Forest Agency has eradicated almost all matured C. equisetifolia so far and is conducting an eradication program for L. leucocephala. Light pollution is another potential threat. It is a significant cause of mortality in Newell’s Shearwater Puffinus newelli, and two of the six P. bryani specimens that were located in the Bonin Island prior to 2015 were collected after apparent disorientation due to artificial lighting.","The species's population size has not been quantified, but given its apparent rarity it is thought to have an extremely small population, probably numbering fewer than 250 mature individuals. The population is therefore placed in the band 50-249 mature individuals, assumed to equate to a total population of c.70-380 individuals.",Decreasing,"The species is currently only known from individuals found in burrows on Midway Island in the north-western Hawaiian chain, U.S.A., and in the Bonin Islands (Ogasawara Islands), Japan. The species was described from an individual collected in 1963 on Midway Island, with another individual of this species observed on Midway during the winters of 1990-1991 and 1991-1992. It is considered unlikely that the species is regularly breeding on Midway or other Hawaiian atolls, as the seabird colonies there have been studied in detail and appropriate natural breeding habitat is lacking (Pyle et al. 2011, 2014). Subsequent analysis of specimens from the Bonin Islands suggests that its main breeding range is within that group, although much exploration is still to be done (Kawakami et al. 2012). In February 2015, 10 birds and at least one nest were discovered on Higashijima in the Bonin Islands (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015), after calls were detected there and on other Bonin Islands with passive acoustic sensors in 2012-2014. Prior to 2012, five of the six individuals recorded on the Bonin Islands had been corpses, three of which had been predated by Black Rats Rattus rattus (Kawakami et al. 2012, Fjeldså 2013). The at-sea distribution is effectively unknown, although at minimum it transits through the tropical or subtropical waters of the central western Pacific Ocean between the north-western Hawaiian chain and the Bonin Islands. Its apparent rarity suggests that the population is extremely small.","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayHigashijima is an IBA. It is protected by the Forestry Agency and access to the island is restricted (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015). Rats have already been eradicated on Higashijima, following a program of poisoned bait application between 2008 and 2010 (Kawakami et al. 2012). Currently, there is an eradication programme ongoing , as detailed for each island in the Ogawasara Islands Ecosystem Conservation Action Plan (Anon. 2010). Work is ongoing to remove introduced plant species on Higashijima. A careful investigation of known seabird colonies in the subtropical/tropical western Pacific may reveal additional records. Street lights that reduce light pollution have been installed in residential areas in the Bonin Islands to reduce disturbance to the species (Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute 2015). Conservation Actions ProposedSurvey seabird colonies on Higashijima and Kitanoshima to confirm additional breeding sites for this species. Examine other known seabird colonies in the subtropical west Pacific for evidence of this species, in particular northern Marianas, Nihoa and Necker Islands and the north-west Hawaiian islands with habitats that support Bulwer's Petrel which may co-utilize breeding crevices with Bryan's Shearwaters (Pyle et al. 2014). Ensure Higashijima is free of rats. Eradicate rats, goats and pigs from all small islands in the Bonin group. Although feral goats and pigs have already been eradicated from all uninhabited small islands in the Bonin Islands, feral goats continue to exist on the inhabited Chichijima Island. Study the ecology and distribution of the species; more information is needed on their at-sea biology (Pyle et al. 2014).",Oceanian,,false,false,Global

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This is a migratory coastal seabird that feeds by plunge diving. It dives from a greater height than other terns. The species breeds in large, dense single- or mixed-species colonies that may contain several thousands of pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It remains gregarious throughout the year, roosting in large groups (Urban et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998) and feeding singly, in small loose groups (Snow and Perrins 1998) or in flocks of many hundreds of individuals (Urban et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998). It is regularly found in mixed species flocks with Lesser Noddy (Anous tenuirostris) and White Tern (Gygis alba) (Ramos 2000). When mixing with the former in conjunction with predatory fish, breeding success was markedly better (Ramos 2000). Large, dense foraging flocks are associated with higher rates of chick feeding (Ramos 2000). Habitat The species nests on sand-dunes, sand-spits, shingle beaches, reefs (Snow and Perrins 1998), saltmarshes and rocky, sandy or coral islands (del Hoyo et al. 1996), showing a preference for densely vegetated sites in temperate regions but sparsely vegetated sites in the tropics (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It also shows a preference for nest sites close to clear, shallow, sandy fishing grounds (Snow and Perrins 1998) in tidal bays and sheltered inshore waters (Snow and Perrins 1998). Throughout the year the species often rests and forages in sheltered estuaries, creeks (Urban et al. 1986), inshore waters and up to several kilometres offshore (del Hoyo et al. 1996), moving to warm tropical coasts after breeding (Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet This species is a specialist forager, and takes a small prey spectrum compared to Common Tern at the same sites (Birdlife International 2000). Its diet consists predominantly of small pelagic fish (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996), particularly sandeel (Birdlife International 2000, Newton and Crowe 2000) and sprat (Birdlife International 2000) and sometimes clupeids (Birdlife International 2000, Newton and Crowe 2000) and gadoids (Newton and Crowe 2000), although it will also take insects and marine invertebrates (del Hoyo et al. 1996) such as crustaceans (Urban et al. 1986). Sandeel are particularly important during chick rearing (Newton and Crowe 2000). In Puerto Rico, adult Roseate Terns fed primarily on dwarf herrings (Jenkinsia lamprotaenia) and anchovies (Anchoa spp.), and chicks were mostly fed dwarf herrings and sardines (Harengula and Opisthonema spp.); few anchovies were fed to chicks (Shealer 1998). Breeding site The nest is a bare scrape in sand, shingle or coral rubble (del Hoyo et al. 1996), preferably in sites surrounded by walls and rocks (Newton and Crowe 2000) or in the shelter of vegetation (in temperate regions) (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998), also in crevices between and under rocks, or in the entrances to rabbit or Puffin burrows (Snow and Perrins 1998). Foraging range At various colonies in New York, USA, birds were observed to forage at sites up to 30 km away from their breeding colony, although at most sites, most birds foraged within 10 km (Birdlife International 2000). Similarly, in Massachusetts, USA, birds foraged at up to 30 km from the breeding colony (Shealer 1996). However, in Puerto Rico birds fed within 2 km of the colony (Shealer 1998). In Ireland, birds at Lady's Island Lake tended to forage about 5 km from the colony at a site 3 km offshore (Newton and Crowe 2000). At Rockabill, Ireland, during chick rearing, birds fed within 10 km of the colony in offshore, relatively deep water (20 - 30 m), but during incubation and post-fledging they appeared to be travelling tens of kilometres to feed over sandbanks to the south (Newton and Crowe 2000). The species may be either coastal or more pelagic in nature, depending on the colony location (Newton and Crowe 2000). Throughout their range they forage in habitats where prey availability is high. Temperate populations feed over tide rips (Birdlife International 2000), shoals (Birdlife International 2000, Environment Canada 2006), inlets (Birdlife International 2000), upwelling areas, and predatory fish that force prey to the surface (Ramos 2000). In Puerto Rico, Roseate Terns feed primarily in deep, open water, and rely heavily on predatory fish to drive prey fish to the surface (Shealer 1998). In the Caribbean, they feed primarily over shoals of predatory fish or along reef margins (Birdlife International 2000). In North American parts of the north-west Atlantic, Roseate Terns appear to use one of two strategies: either foraging over tide-rips, sand shoals and sandbars (Safina 1990, Shealer 1996, Gochfeld et al. 1998), in some cases up to 20-30 km from the colony, or more pelagically in deeper water over schools of predatory fish which flush prey fish species to the surface (Shealer 1996, Gochfeld et al. 1998). Where predatory fish are not relied upon, the birds forage over sandy substrates (Sheer and Kress 1994) in water under 10 m deep (Safina 1990, Shealer and Kress 1994). On Aride Island, Seychelles, birds concentrated their foraging along the coastline exposed to prevailing winds (Ramos 2000).","Trapping of adults and egg collecting continues in colonies in East Africa and the Caribbean, while trapping of adults in wintering areas is frequent in West Africa and north east South America (Gochfeld et al. 2018). The species is also thought to suffer from bycatch mortality in the Seychelles, where a large decline coincided with a considerable increase in long-line activity (Gochfeld et al. 2018). Predation can have significant effects, including complete breeding failure at some Azores colonies (Avery et al. 1995). Habitat loss in northern Europe is not a major problem but has caused the local extinction of some colonies, as have extreme weather events (Avery et al. 1995).","The global population is estimated to number c.200,000-220,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 2,300-2,900 pairs, which equates to 4,500-5,800 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). National population estimates include: c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 individuals on migration in China; c.100-100,000 breeding pairs and c.50-10,000 individuals on migration in Taiwan and c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 individuals on migration in Japan (Brazil 2009).",Unknown,"This species breeds in widely but sparsely distributed colonies along the east coast and offshore islands of Canada, U.S.A., from Honduras to Venezuela, possibly to Brazil, the Caribbean (including the Bahamas, Greater and Lesser Antilles and the West Indies), U.K., France, Ireland, Portugal (Azores, Salvages and perhaps Madeira), Spain (Canary Islands), South Africa, Kenya, Somalia, Madagascar, Oman, Seychelles, St Brandon and the Mascarene Islands (Mauritius), Maldives, Chagos (British Indian Ocean Territory), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India), Sri Lanka, Ryukyu Islands (Japan), Indonesia, Fiji, Solomon Islands, New Guinea (Papua New Guinea), New Caledonia (to France) and Australia (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The population in North America underwent a significant decline in 40 years, decreasing from 8,500 pairs in the early 1930s to 2,500 in 1978 (Brown and Nettleship 1984). Numbers, however, appear to have stabilised at 3,000 pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In Nova Scotia, the decline was from 200 to 32 pairs (Brown and Nettleship 1984). Between 1969 and 1992, the U.K. population declined from 1,018 pairs to 57, and pairs in Ireland dropped from 1,435 to 454 (Sprunt 1984). In 1995, however, over 1,700 pairs bred in Europe and the latest estimate is 2,300-2,900 pairs breeding in Europe (BirdLife International 2015). The French population is 9-58 pairs (BirdLife International 2015) which may be a decline from c.500 in 1973. The large Azores population has fluctuated between 550 and 1,028 pairs from 1989/90 to 1995 (Snow and Perrins 1998) with the most recent estimate at c. 840-1,350 pairs (BirdLife International 2015). The population in the Republic of Ireland is estimated at 1,300 pairs (BirdLife International 2015). The tropical Indian Ocean may be the most secure region for this species (Feare 1984).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayBreeding birds in Europe are fully protected by national and international law but at sea outside of European territorial waters or in the coastal waters of other countries protection is limited (Tucker and Heath 1994). An action plan for the recovery of the European population was launched in 1987 (Avery 1987) and most of its recommendations have been implemented (Avery et al. 1995). An International Species Action Plan was published in 1999 (Newbery 1999). Habitat restoration work was carried out on Praia Islet in the Azores Archipelago, including rabbit eradication, control of soil erosion, reintroduction of native plants and installation of nest boxes for the species (Bried et al. 2009).Conservation Actions ProposedLegislative protection and enforcement should be introduced for the entire range of this species (Tucker and Heath 1994). Breeding pairs are known to be attracted to coastal locations where artificial nesting sites have been constructed (e.g. beaches of bare shingle and islands or rafts covered with sparse vegetation) (Burgess and Hirons 1992) and nesting-boxes provided (chicks may also use nest-boxes as shelters if adults do not nest in them directly) (Avery et al. 1995, Casey et al. 1995, Environment Canada 2000, Newton and Crowe 2000). Increased breeding successes can also be gained through nest-site vegetation management (Newton and Crowe 2000, Casey et al. 1995), landscaping (e.g. creating terraces or infilling flooded hollows), flood prevention (Newton and Crowe 2000), and continuous wardening to minimise unauthorised disturbance (Newton and Crowe 2000, Casey et al. 1995). Non-lethal predator control (e.g. destroying eggs and nests of gull species attempting to nest on islands) can also be successful in increasing the overall breeding success of the species (Casey et al. 1995, Environment Canada 2000, Leonard et al. 2004). Colonies which seem abandoned should still be protected and maintained to allow recolonization. At selected sites population and productivity monitoring should continue (Tucker and Heath 1994).",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The Fennoscandian population has undergone a severe historical decline, and has not yet recovered.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory, and information about its migration routes has only recently come to light as a result of satellite telemetry studies and increased monitoring efforts (Lorentsen et al. 1998, Aarvak and Øien 2003, Kear 2005). The species departs from its breeding grounds in northern Scandinavia and Arctic Russia in late August to early September. The Fennoscandian population follows several routes: either south (through Hungary), or east and then south, through the Russian Taimyr Peninsula in northern Siberia, northern Kazakhstan and finally the Black Sea (Snow and Perrins 1998, Øien et al. 2005), to reach wintering grounds in south-east Europe. The West Asian main population migrates mainly south along the Ob River Valley in Russia, via the same staging grounds in northern Kazakhstan to wintering grounds in Azerbaijan and the Middle East (around the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf) (Alerstam 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998). The East Asian main population winters in eastern China and the Korean peninsula (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Madsen 1996) as well as increasingly in Japan (some 100 individuals; T. Ikeuchi per N. Mikander in litt. 2016). The return passage to the breeding grounds begins in February, with the species arriving from early May to late June (Madsen 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). In Siberia, non-breeding birds undertake a moult-migration to higher altitudes or to areas north of the breeding range (Madsen 1996) and non-breeders or failed breeders from the Fennoscandian population migrate eastwards and join these flocks before the onset of moulting (Aarvak and Øien 2003). Evidence indicates that this species is not a colonial breeder (Johnsgard 1978), but nests in pairs on isolated territories (Madge and Burn 1988). However, the species is gregarious outside the breeding season (Madge and Burn 1988). Habitat Breeding This species breeds in low-lying bogs, scrub-covered tundra and taiga-forest edges close to wetlands, up to 700 m above sea level (Kear 2005). It can also be found on the slopes by lower parts of mountain streams, on mountain foothills, mountain lakes and on alpine precipices, often in thawing boggy areas or on stonefields (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Johnsgard 1978). Adults of this species undergo a post-breeding flightless summer moult whilst still in their breeding range. In Siberia and Fennoscandia, non-breeding adults migrate to areas north (West Asian main) or east (Fennoscandian) of the breeding range or to higher altitudes to exploit large open water fringed with sedge (Carex), or river valleys with long grass and scrub to escape predation (Aarvak and Øien 2003, Kear 2005). Non-breeding During winter and on migration, this species frequents open short grassland in the steppe and semi-arid zones, particularly in sodic (e.g. seashore) pastures, arable farmland, pastures and meadows (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madsen 1996, Kear 2005). Winter roosting colonies are also formed on large lakes and rivers, or in reedbeds and rushes (Cramp and Simmons 1977, Madge and Burn 1988). Diet This species is herbivorous, feeding on grasses, roots, stems, leaves, fruits and the green parts of aquatic and terrestrial plants along lake-shores, rivers and marshes (Kear 2005). During the winter the species supplements its diet with winter agricultural grains (Kear 2005). Breeding site Birds of this species often nest on snow-free patches available early in the breeding season (such as rocky outcrops or prominent hummocks) hidden amongst vegetation (grass, dwarf shrub heathland) or in boggy hollows (Madsen 1996, Kear 2005), usually in close proximity to open water or marshy areas (Kear 2005).","Disturbance on breeding grounds (e.g. from increasing tourism, angling and reindeer husbandry) causes much disruption to nesting birds in Fennoscandia (Madsen 1996, N. Mikander in litt. 2016). Disturbance by hunters can be a significant limiting factor on survival and breeding output (Ebbinge and Spaans 1995, N. Petkov in litt. 2007). Illegal spring hunting and round-ups of moulting birds are taking place on the Russian breeding grounds (Jones in press) and illegal shooting continues in Norway (T. Aarvak pers. comm. 2007). In autumn and winter, illegal killing (including by poisoning; A. Fox in litt. 2016) and accidental shooting on the staging and wintering grounds is the most important threat (Madsen 1996, Aarvak et al.1997, Lorentsen et al. 1998, Kear 2005, Morozov 2006, Jones in press). In the Western Palearctic, at least 20-30% of the population are shot each year (Mooij 2010), often accidentally during hunting of other species. Habitat deterioration, as a result of land cultivation and increased water-levels in the Caspian Sea, is a further threat (Madsen 1996), as is habitat loss through the creation of reservoirs for hydroelectric power in Scandinavia (Madsen 1996). The species may also be threatened by nest predation from the Red Fox Vulpes vulpes and Arctic Fox Alopex lagopus (Madsen 1996, V. Morozov in litt. 2016). Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and others dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 28% of the habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler and Lysenko 2000). The wintering population at Dongting Lake, China, is considered to now be relatively stable, but the concentration of the majority of birds in this population at one site makes it extremely vulnerable to any factor that could affect this locality (Cong et al. 2012), most notably with changing hydrology and water quality of the Yangtze River (A. Fox in litt. 2016). This is especially the case because the species is reliant on specialist recessional grasslands in spring and autumn (Wang et al. 2012, 2013). In the region of Kaliningrad, Russia, important migratory stop-over points on the Baltic Sea coastline are being degraded through petroleum pollution, wetland drainage for agriculture, changes in wetland management leading to scrub and reed overgrowth, peat extraction, and the burning and mowing of reed beds (Grishanov 2006).","The most recent total population estimate is 24,000-40,000 individuals, which compares with previous published global estimates of 25,000 to 30,000 individuals (Lorentsen et al. 1999) and 22,000 to 27,000 (Delany and Scott 2006). This includes 10,000-21,000 individuals in autumn in its Western Palearctic range (Jones et al. 2008, Fox et al. 2010) and 14,000-19,000 individuals from the East Asian Flyway (Jia et al. 2016, C. Lei per A. Fox in litt. 2016). In 1988-1993, 64,000 individuals were recorded (Jia et al. 2016); in 1997, the number declined to 20,000 individuals (Li and Mundkur 2004), and to less than 17,000 individuals (Morozov and Syroechkovski 2005): 16,937 birds were counted in the Lower Yangtze Valley in 2004 (Barter et al. 2004), and 16,600 in East Dongting Lake Nature Reserve in 2004 (Barter 2005). The Russian populations have declined from a former estimate of 30,000-50,000 individuals (Morozov 1995). The Fennoscandian population has declined from more than 10,000 birds in the early 20th century.",Decreasing,"Four subpopulations of Anser erythropus can be recognised. Three of these are surviving components of the species’s formerly extensive breeding range: the Fennoscandian population which breeds in the Nordic countries (Norway 20-25 pairs, Finland 0-5 pairs, Sweden 15-25 pairs,which has been reinforced by reintroductions (BirdLife International 2015) and the Kola Peninsula in Russia; the Western Asian main population which breeds in northern Russian tundra to the centre of the Taimyr Peninsula, including Putorana Plateau, and to the west and east of Pechora and Western Siberia (Yamal and Gydan peninsulas); and the Eastern Asian main population which breeds in the southern Taimyr and areas north of Eastern Siberia and Chukotka. Fennoscandian breeders overwinter at Kerkini Lake and in the Evros Delta between Greece and Turkey (Lorentsen et al. 1998). A small wintering population is also now established in The Netherlands, which originates from the reintroduced breeding population in Sweden. Birds from the Western Asian main population winter around the Black and Caspian Seas, mainly in Azerbaijan, Iraq, Iran and Uzbekistan (V. Morozov in litt. 2016, N. Mikander, I. Øien and T. Aarvak in litt. 2016); and birds from the Eastern Asian main population winter in the Yangtze River Valley in China (following considerable range contractions in this country; A. Fox in litt. 2016), the Korean Peninsula and in Japan (N. Mikander in litt. 2016). Fennoscandian breeding birds occur on passage mainly in Finland, Estonia and Hungary, while many non-breeders migrate through Russia and Kazakhstan (Tolvanen et al. 1999, Aarvak and Øien 2003, Morozov and Syroechkovski 2005), and in smaller numbers in Lithuania, Slovakia, Romania (Munteanu et al. 1991, Aarvak et al. 1997) Bosnia and Herzegovina, Albania, and Bulgaria (Petkov et al. 1999). Birds from the Western Asian main population occur during passage mainly in Kazakhstan, but also Syria, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan (Jones et al. 2008); and birds from the Eastern Asian main population possibly stop-over in Mongolia (A. Bräunlich in litt. 2011, N. Mikander in litt. 2016). Due to limited genetic introgression of Greater White-fronted Goose genetic material in the reinforced Swedish population, some concerns have been raised about whether that population should be considered in the current Red List assessment. The current Guidelines for Using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (Version 11, February 2014) do not provide any guidance on what levels of hybrid gene frequency are acceptable to allow inclusion of populations of released birds from captive breeding programmes in a Red List assessment. However, a global assessment of Red List Category is not affected by this debate.","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I and II and designated for Concerted Action (CMS Resolution 5.1). Listed in Table 1 Column A of the Action Plan under the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA 2008) and in Annex II ‘Strictly protected species’ of the Bern Convention. Listed in Annex 1 of the EU Birds Directive. It is protected in most states of its key range.

After breeding the species undergoes a moulting period when it is flightless for c.1 month between July and August (Scott and Rose 1996), with some populations undertaking extensive northward moult migrations (Kear 2005), and most congregating into large moulting flocks near open water (Scott and Rose 1996). The species departs from its breeding grounds after this post-breeding moulting period in early September, arriving in the winter quarters from late September through October (Madge and Burn 1988). It remains gregarious throughout the winter (Madge and Burn 1988) (although it occurs in smaller, looser flocks than many other goose species [Snow and Perrins 1998]) and roosts close to feeding areas (Madge and Burn 1988) in mixed-species flocks on lakes, rivers and flooded lands (Kear 2005). Habitat Breeding The species breeds near lakes, pools, rivers and streams in high Arctic tundra or the taiga forest zone (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Taiga nesting populations show a preference for scrubby birch Betula spp. forest (Madge and Burn 1988) and dense spruce forest with bogs or mires (Madge and Burn 1988), whereas tundra-based populations nest on damp tundra of moss, grass, sedge or scrub (Johnsgard 1978) near river flood-plains, but above flood levels (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005), on Arctic islands and in Arctic coastal regions (Madge and Burn 1988). Non-breeding During the winter and on passage the species inhabits marshes, agricultural land (del Hoyo et al. 1992), e.g. pastures, arable fields and rice-paddies (Kear 2005), damp steppe grassland (Madge and Burn 1988), flood-lands, rivers and coastal shallows (Snow and Perrins 1998) in open country (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It also roosts on lakes, rivers and flood-lands in Europe during this season (Kear 2005). Diet The species is herbivorous (del Hoyo et al. 1992), its diet consisting of herbs, grasses, sedges (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and mosses (Johnsgard 1978), complemented during the breeding season by berries (e.g. from Empetrum or Vaccinium spp.) (del Hoyo et al. 1992). During the winter it feeds predominantly on agricultural land taking grain, beans, potatoes (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and sprouting winter cereal crops (Kear 2005). Breeding site The species builds a nest of vegetation in a shallow scrape on the ground (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Taiga breeders nest in bogs or mires within forested regions, placing nests within 400 m of open mire and within 2 km of open water, usually 50-100 cm above bog surfaces on hummocks that are safe from flooding (Kear 2005). Tundra breeders nest on dry hummocks and moss (Kear 2005). Management information An investigation carried out in one of the species's wintering areas (UK) found that it was most likely to forage on improved grassland or grasslands grazed by cattle that were a minimum of 5 ha in area, had an optimum sward height of c.20 cm and were at a distance of less than 9 km away from roosting sites (Vickery and Gill 1999).","The species declined in the past due to hunting (resulting in mortality, injury and disturbance) (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005, Nikolaeva et al. 2006) and habitat loss (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Habitat degradation due to oil pollution (Grishanov 2006, Nikolaeva et al. 2006), drainage, peat-extraction, changing management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and forest clearance is a threat to breeding areas in Russia (Grishanov 2006), Norway and Sweden (Madge and Burn 1988). The species also suffers from human persecution (Madge and Burn 1988) and is susceptible to poisoning by pesticides used on agricultural land (Kwon et al. 2004). Climate change poses a potential threat longer term on breeding grounds, most likely particularly to tundra populations (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).","The global population is estimated at 680,000-800,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

The breeding season starts from early-April or mid-May with the species nesting in solitary pairs amidst colonies of other species or in small mixed-species colonies (del Hoyo et al. 1996) of up to 50-100 individuals (Richards 1990), e.g. with Herring Gull Larus argentatus (del Hoyo et al. 1996) in favourable locations (Richards 1990). The autumn migration occurs between July and November (peaking October-November) and the return migration to the breeding grounds occurs between March and April (Olsen and Larsson 2003). Outside of the breeding season the species is largely gregarious (Olsen and Larsson 2003). Habitat The species inhabits rocky or sandy coasts, estuaries and inshore and offshore waters, breeding on vegetated islands, dunes, flat-topped stacks, rocky shores (del Hoyo et al. 1996), flat beaches (Snow and Perrins 1998) and islands in saltmarsh (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species may also breed on undisturbed inland sites including islets in large freshwater lakes and rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998), fields and open moorland (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet The species is omnivorous and opportunistic, its diet consisting of fish, adult and young birds, birds eggs, mammals (rabbits, lemmings, rats and mice), insects, marine invertebrates (molluscs), carrion and refuse (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow cup constructed from grass, moss and seaweed and is positioned on sand, grass or bare rock substrates on vegetated islands, rocky ridges and outcrops, dunes (del Hoyo et al. 1996), flat beaches (Snow and Perrins 1998) and islands in saltmarsh among scrub (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species may also nest in undisturbed inland sites such as islets in large freshwater lakes and rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998), fields and open moorland (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Management information The breeding densities of this species in the Baltic Sea were unaffected by the removal of the introduced nest predator American Mink Neovison vison from small offshore breeding islands (Nordstrom et al. 2003). The species is considered to be a threat to other bird species due to its predatory and opportunistic diet (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","Continuing reductions in the quantities of available discards in the North Atlantic are believed to be driving the observed decline in eastern Atlantic populations in recent years (Burger et al. 2018). The species is hunted for sport in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006). Within its European range it is vulnerable to collision with offshore wind farms (Bradbury et al. 2014) and to being caught as bycatch in fishing gear, including longlines, trawls and gill-nets (Anderson et al. 2011, Žydelis et al. 2013). It is vulnerable to coastal oil spills and other types of surface water pollution.","The European population is estimated at 118,000-133,000 pairs, which equates to 237,000-266,000 mature individuals or 360,000-400,000 individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Combining the European population estimate with that for the north-west Atlantic population in Wetlands International (2015) gives a global estimate of 690,000-940,000 individuals.

Radar surveys show that the species is declining rapidly on at least one of the other islands where it breeds (Kaua'i), and declines are probable on other islands too. Therefore, it is assessed as Endangered.","On Maui, Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, nesting takes place mainly between 2,000 and 3,000 m, in lava cavities with little vegetation nearby (D. Ainley in litt. 2007). Elsewhere, for example West Maui (J. Penniman in litt. 2007) and Kaua'i (N. Holmes in litt. 2007), it nests at lower elevations, amongst dense shrubs and ferns or in native grasslands with bracken (Ainley et al. 1997, Simons and Hodges 1998, P. Baker in litt. 1999, D. Ainley in litt. 2007). On Haleakalā, Maui, birds nest in rock crevices and tunnels that are over 0.5 m deep, often exceeding two metres (Simons and Hodges 1998, J. Penniman in litt. 2007). Pairs nest in cavities in the volcanic terrain, in burrows beneath rocks or at the base of clay cliffs (N. Holmes in litt. 2007). At lower altitudes, they excavate burrows or nest in cavities often at the base of trees (Simons and Hodges 1998, P. Baker in litt. 1999, N. Holmes in litt. 2007), although many burrows on Lana'i are not at the base of trees (J. Penniman in litt. 2007). On Lana'i, birds breed in dense uluhe fern habitat (Dicranopteris linearis and Diplopterygium pinnatum) and start breeding in March, whereas in Haleakalā, Maui, birds begin breeding in mid-February (Penniman et al. 2008). On Kaua'i, birds breed in montane wet forests, where burrows are located along ridgelines in predominantly native forest, often at the base of large trees. On average, birds take five to six years to reach maturity but begin visiting colonies to establish pair bonds and prospect nesting sites at 2-3 years (Hess and Banko 2006). Most eggs are laid in May and June, with most young fledging by December (Mitchell et al. 2005). Birds nesting at higher elevations appear to finish provisioning chicks earlier, with most birds having departed the colony at Haleakalā by the end of October. The diet comprises mostly fish and squid, with squid constituting c.50-75% of the food ingested (Simons and Hodges 1998). It has been found that at least some birds nesting on Lana'i feed in waters around the Aleutian Islands, as shown through the use of tracking devices on several breeding individuals (P. Baicich in litt. 2007). P. sandwichensis regularly is observed foraging in mixed species flocks in association with predatory fish species (Mitchell et al. 2005). ","Historically the species suffered declines through harvesting by early Polynesians and during the period of Hawaiian settlement beginning c.1,800 years ago (Carlile et al. 2003). The species may have been restricted to its current breeding range since the arrival of Europeans (Carlile et al. 2003). The most serious current threat is predation by introduced vertebrates including Indian mongoose Herpestes javanicus, feral cats, Common Barn-owls Tyto alba, rats, dogs, and pigs. Although not yet established on Kaua'i and Lana'i islands, mongooses represent an ongoing major threat to nestling and adult birds at breeding colonies on the other islands within the Hawaiian Petrel’s range. Feral cat and rat depredation, where unmanaged on other islands, continues to limit recovery capacity. Considerable efforts are ongoing to reduce the impact of cat predation on the species with cat-proof fences erected on Maui and Mauna Loa. Adults and nestlings are very susceptible to predation, as nests are on the ground, and they are naïve to predators. A significantly lower percentage of birds come ashore to nest during El Niño years (c.40% compared to c.65% normally) (C.N. Hodges per Carlile et al. 2003), suggesting that the species is sensitive to such disturbances in environmental conditions (Carlile et al. 2003). Each autumn during the fledging season, some of the fledgling birds become grounded as a result of light attraction and disorientation. Occassionally, birds collide with sources of light, and mortality sometimes occurs as a result of collisions with fences and power-lines mostly on Kaua'i and Maui (Simons 1985, Cooper and Day 1998, Simons and Hodges 1998). Once on the ground, fledglings are unable to fly and are killed by cars, cats and dogs, die from environmental exposure or injuries, or are recovered by the public. The siting of the Kaheawa wind farm on Lana'i also appears to be causing ongoing mortality at a potentially significant rate. Some areas of nesting habitat have been lost to the pressures of modern urbanisation and degraded by feral goats and pigs and weeds. Nest burrows are trampled by feral goats, mouflon sheep and Chital Deer Axis axis (Mitchell et al. 2005, H. T. Harvey and Associates 2015) however, these are now excluded from the largest colony and deer are not present at the majority of sites. On Lana'i, habitat degradation caused by the invasive tree, Strawberry Guava Psidium cattleianum, is considered to be the biggest threat to the long term survival of the colony (J. Penniman in litt. 2007). In the past, considerable amounts of the Hawaiian Petrel’s habitat were converted for livestock, however as the majority of colonies are now protected, this represents a much reduced threat.","Spear et al. (1995) give a best estimate of 3,750-4,500 breeding pairs based on at-sea surveys. This roughly equates to 7,500-9,000 mature individuals, and 11,250-13,500 individuals in total. The discovery of possibly several thousand birds breeding on Lana'i during terrestrial surveys in 2006-2007 and two small colonies on West Maui (J. Penniman in litt. 2007), probably in the tens or low hundreds of birds (D. Ainley in litt. 2007), may bring the estimated breeding population close to the upper estimate of 6,500-8,300 pairs calculated by Spear et al. (1995). However, the rapid decline in at least the population on Kaua'i would suggest that the population size may now in fact be smaller than this. Given uncertainty regarding overall trends, the upper and lower bounds from Spear et al. (1995) are used here, i.e. 3,750-8,300 pairs, or 7,500-16,600 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Pterodroma sandwichensis ranges in the central Pacific and breeds on the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.). There are approximately 2,547 known burrows within Haleakalā National Park (Haleakalā National Park 2015 unpubl. data). Two small colonies are present in the West Maui Mountains, but they are so far unquantified (Cooper and Day 2003, J. Penniman in litt. 2007), with numbers perhaps in the tens or low hundreds (D. Ainley in litt. 2007). On Hawai'i, small numbers breed on Mauna Kea and 40-50 pairs were present on Mauna Loa prior to 1995 (Ainley et al. 1997, Simons and Hodges 1998). On Kaua'i, 1,600 pairs are indicated by observations of birds at a rafting site (Ainley et al. 1997). On Moloka'i, 5-10 birds were heard calling in 1980, suggesting small numbers (Simons and Hodges 1998), but there has not been a concerted effort to estimate numbers on this island (D. Ainley in litt. 2007). Surveys in 2006-2007 located a colony in the cloud forests of Lana'ihale on the north side of Lana'i (P. Baicich in litt. 2007, A. Wilson in litt. 2007). This population probably numbers several thousand birds, based on the volume of calling during night time listening surveys in April and May along the Lana'ihale ridge at the highest point in the uplands, although only 14 burrows had been found by October 2007 (J. Penniman in litt. 2007). Surveys have so far been hampered by weather conditions and the risk of habitat disturbance (J. Penniman in litt. 2007).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I. On Maui, there is a long-term monitoring programme in the Haleakala National Park (Simons and Hodges 1998) and efforts are made to control introduced mammals. In 1976, a perimeter fence was put up around the main colony to exclude feral goats and pigs from the habitat (Carlile et al. 2003). The predator exclosures placed around the national park may have facilitated an increase in the number of birds in eastern Maui (Cooper and Day 2003). The trapping of rats started in 1968, and since 1997 rodenticides have been used (Carlile et al. 2003). Cats and mongooses have been controlled since 1981, and trapping of these species and rats continues to be carried out year-round (Carlile et al. 2003). On Lana'i: colony delineation surveys are continuing (J. Penniman in litt. 2007), and as burrows are found they are included in basic breeding biology study; feral cats are being trapped and removed; studies on Common Barn-owl Tyto alba are being designed; a rat population assessment was due to begin in 2007, with control by rodenticide to be carried out subsequently; habitat restoration work may begin in January 2008; and public education projects will be implemented in 2008 (J. Penniman in litt. 2007). In 2006, a fence was completed to encircle a large portion of the breeding habitat on Lana'i; the purpose was to exclude ungulates that damage the vegetation thus impacting the island's water supply (D. Ainley in litt. 2007). Simultaneously, a limited cat-trapping programme has been initiated in the fenced area (D. Ainley in litt. 2007). On Maui, Lana'i, and Kaua'i, grounded fledglings are collected and released, although the benefit of doing this has yet to be confirmed as very few banded individuals have subsequently been encountered (D. Ainley in litt. 2007). Fencing erected for forest conservation has been modified to reduce collisions (Simons and Hodges 1998). On Kaua'i, auditory surveys to detect colonies are ongoing, and have included documenting the first known nesting sites on Kaua'i in the Upper Limahuli Preserve (N. Holmes in litt. 2007). Also on Kaua'i, street lighting is shielded in critical areas and lighting on some buildings has been modified to reduce collisions (Ainley et al. 1997, Simons and Hodges 1998). A ruling brought by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006, under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, has enforced a campaign running since 2005, in which all non-essential lights on Kaua'i are required to be turned off or shielded between 15 September and 15 December when young birds leave their nests (Appel 2006). The island's electricity company is helping by darkening all of its 3,000 street lights, and shielding or turning some of them off. The company has also fitted large balls to power lines in an effort to reduce the number of birds that collide with the cables (Appel 2006). Significant improvements have beem made in reducing light attraction and collision, although there is still a considerable amount of new and existing infrastructure that requires modification (N. Holmes in litt. 2007). Methods are currently being developed to quantify the population on each island; surveys for colonies on West Maui are being carried out and surveys on Moloka`i were planned to begin in Spring 2008 (J. Penniman in litt. 2007). Conservation Actions ProposedImprove radar sampling for use as a population monitoring technique (D. Ainley in litt. 2007, J. Penniman in litt. 2007). Use passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to study colony attendance by breeding pairs (J. Penniman in litt. 2007). Reduce collisions with power lines by making them more visible, burying them or moving them further inland where birds fly higher (Cooper and Day 1998). Ensure lighting does not attract petrels (Ainley et al. 1997b). Control predators in known colonies (M. Morin in litt. 2000), and improve measures for the declining colonies at Mauna Loa, Hawai'i (Carlile et al. 2003) and West Maui (D. Ainley in litt. 2007). Monitor breeding success (Carlile et al. 2003). Continue to retrieve grounded birds (Carlile et al. 2003), but conduct research to assess the effectiveness of rehabilitation methods (D. Ainley in litt. 2007). Continue to search for additional breeding areas (Carlile et al. 2003). Carry out further research into foraging range and feeding behaviour and investigate the species's vulnerability to human-induced mortality at sea (Carlile et al. 2003). Investigate the impact of the loss of tuna schools that the species depends upon for foraging (D. Ainley in litt. 2007).

It feeds mostly on planktonic crustaceans, fish and squid but will also feed on human refuse. It mainly feeds in the day on the wing by pattering, dipping and also by surface-seizing. Its breeding season varies locally in colonies on undisturbed islets, in flat areas near the sea or inland on cliffs (del Hoyo et al. 1992)","The Band-rumped Storm-petrel is threatened by a number of invasive species, and throughout its range, the species is largely restricted to breeding locations that do not possess invasive mammals. Carcasses of near-fledging chicks have been recovered from burrow entrances on Kaua'i with cat scats also recorded and cats are considered the introduced species responsible for the majority of predation events to date (Slotterback 2002, Raine et al. 2017). Cat predation is also likely to have restricted Band-rumped Storm-petrels to remote and largely inaccessible breeding locations in Macaronesian islands (Monteiro et al. 1999). It is suspected that House Rats Rattus rattus may have contributed to considerable declines and potentially extirpations (Slotterback 2002, Raine et al. 2017). Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans are considered to be restricting the distribution of the species to steep slopes with little vegetation on Lehua Islet (Raine et al. 2017), and this species may be that observed entering burrows on Kaua'i (Galase et al. 2016). Small Indian Mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus are significant predators of the slightly larger Hawaiian Petrel Pterodroma sandwichensis, but have only recently become established on Kaua'i (Duffy and Capece 2014). The severity of impacts from this predator may increase, should the population be allowed to increase and spread. On Kaua'i, the introduced Common Barn Owl Tyto alba is a major predator of adults (Raine et al. 2017). Pigs are considered a significant threat to the species due to their observed impacts on other seabird species (Slotterback 2002); however, there does not appear to be any direct evidence of predation or habitat destruction caused by pigs impacting this species (Slotterback 2002, Raine et al. 2017). Band-rumped Storm-petrels have been found grounded due to light pollution in the Canary Islands (Rodríguez and Rodríguez 2009, Carboneras et al. 2018) and Hawaii (Slotterback 2002, Raine et al. 2017). Mortality due to striking structures while disorientated has occurred (Slotterback 2002). However, the species appears less prone to 'fallout' than expected, and impacts are therefore likely to be of a lower severity (Rodríguez and Rodríguez 2009, Raine et al. 2017). The threat from introduced predators appears far more severe than that from light pollution at present. The Band-rumped Storm-petrel is thought to have been hunted on a large scale in the early 16th and 17th century, with accounts from the Azores of a small black and white seabird that was killed nightly by the thousands for food and oil (Bolton et al. 2008). However, this threat is highly unlikely to return on anything close to this scale.","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number around 150,000 individuals.

It has therefore been uplisted to Vulnerable. The cause(s) of declines are unknown, but are likely multi-faceted and further research is needed to inform conservation actions.","This species is marine and pelagic, often occurring in areas of convergence or upwelling or over continental shelves, rarely coming near land except at colonies. During the breeding season, birds from the western Atlantic are highly pelagic in their foraging habits, travelling to deep (median &gt;1,950 m) and relatively unproductive waters (chlorophyll a concentrations &lt;0.5 mg/m3) over and beyond continental slopes lying, on average, 400 to 830 km from colonies (Pollet et al. 2014, Hedd et al. 2018). Its diet comprises mainly of small fish, squid, planktonic crustaceans and offal which it catches on the wing by dipping, skimming or snatching from the surface. It sometimes follows marine mammals feeding on leftovers or faeces. Its breeding season is variable depending on locality, forming colonies on offshore islands on high ground or slopes, usually among rocks but also in soft soil between trees (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","Brown Rats Rattus norvegicus and House Rats R. rattus, are considered to exert a considerable predation pressure on the species where they establish on breeding islands, and may be a key determinant of the present breeding distribution, possibly along with cats. Cats Felis catus predate large numbers of adult and fledgling Leach's Storm-petrels where present, and may have been responsible for the extirpation of the species from a number of formerly occupied sites. Foxes caused the extirpation of the species from numerous islands in Alaska following their introduction, with their eradication on a number of islands leading to subsequent recolonization by Leach’s Storm-petrel. Mice Mus musculus are also suspected to be impacting the species through nest predation, but the effects are unclear.Leach’s Storm-petrel Hydrobates leucorhous experiences high levels of predation from native predators. In 1997, Herring Gulls Larus argentatus killed almost 49,000 adult petrels during the breeding season on Great Island, Newfoundland, which at the time had a breeding colony of around 270,000 pairs (Stenhouse et al. 2000). Great Skuas Catharacta skua predate Leach’s Storm-petrels, with around 21,000 individuals killed each year in the St. Kilda colony; however, these primarily represent non-breeding birds that had immigrated from other, larger colonies, hence this is thought to have a relatively small impact on the population (Stead 2010). Great Larus marinus and Lesser Black-backed Gulls L. fuscus are also known to predate relatively large numbers of adult Leach's Storm-petrel (Stenhouse et al. 2000), though the extent to which this drives declines is uncertain. Research activities have been shown to cause considerable disturbance to Leach’s Storm-petrel and represent a cause of reduced reproductive success. In a study by Blackmer (2004), it was found that weekly investigator disturbance halved the hatching success of Leach’s Storm-petrel nests, and daily disturbance caused a 56% reduction. Of all the reproductive failures in this study, egg desertion accounted for 91% and only occurred in pairs in the disturbed treatment groups. Foraging ranges during the breeding season for five out of seven western Atlantic colonies overlapped with offshore oil and gas operations; three of these colonies have declined in recent decades (Hedd et al. 2018). Attraction to lights and flares and subsequent collisions with oil rigs poses a risk (Hedd et al. 2018). Large oil spills represent a relatively unlikely but potentially very severe threat, although due to this bird’s large range, it would be likely to affect only a small portion of the population. Small spills of hydrocarbons and synthetic drilling fluids are relatively common (CNLOPB 2012, McCrary et al. 2003) and contribute to chronic oil pollution in the sea (National Research Council 1985).","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number &gt;20,000,000 individuals.  Based on the compilation of available data the current population comprises 6.7-8.3 million breeding pairs; 40-48% of these breed in the Atlantic basin and 52-60% in the Pacific. Throughout the western Atlantic (&gt;90% of basin total), populations are declining, including at Baccalieu Island, Newfoundland, Canada, home to the largest colony. The population at Baccalieu Island, estimated at 3.3 million breeding pairs in 1984 (Sklepkovych and Montevecchi 1989), had declined to 2.02 million pairs by 2013 (Environment Canada unpublished data), and the former second and third regionally largest colonies have declined by &gt;50% since the late 1990s (Wilhelm et al. 2015, Environment Canada unpublished data). In the eastern Atlantic, the population at St. Kilda is also declining, this being the largest colony in the UK and Ireland (Newson et al. 2008).  Population trends in the Pacific are less well known. In Alaska, where Leach’s Hydrobates leucorhous and Fork-tailed Storm-petrels H. furactus are largely combined for monitoring purposes, population trends are stable or increasing (Slater and Byrd 2009, Dragoo et al. 2016), the large population at Daikoku Island, Japan may have declined since 1982, while trends of western North American and Russian populations are unknown. Despite these knowledge gaps, compiling available data collected between 1977 and 2016, representing 75-80% of the global population (including Europe, eastern North America, and Japan), points to a decline of ≥30% over three generations (39 years, based on a generation length estimated by BirdLife to be 13 years).Definitive information on Leach’s Storm-petrel population decline comes mainly from colonies within the Atlantic basin.  Recent genetics research indicates that while there is no genetic structure among Atlantic colonies, populations within the Atlantic and the Pacific are genetically distinct (Bicknell et al. 2012).  Evidence of movement of pre-breeding birds among colonies within the Atlantic, led to the conclusion that North Atlantic birds may be operating as a metapopulation and that management of this species may be best viewed at an oceanic scale (Bicknell et al. 2012, 2014).",Decreasing,"This species has an extensive global range. Breeding colonies are largely confined to the northern hemisphere, from the South Kuril Islands (Japan) round to Baja California (Mexico) including the Aleutian Islands, Alaska (U.S.A.) and Canada in the Pacific, and in the north-east North America, Iceland, northern United Kingdom and Norway in the Atlantic. Small numbers also breed off South Africa (Underhill et al. 2002). Northern populations migrate south into the tropics in winter, reaching the equator in the Pacific and as far south as south Brazil and South Africa in the Atlantic (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIt is listed in Appendix II of the Bern Convention, and Annex I of the EU Birds Directive.

Invasive species are known to have had significant impacts on species on Guadalupe Island, and so if the species persists on the main island then the species is likely to be in continuing decline. Therefore, this newly-split species is precautionarily listed as Endangered.","The species's range over pelagic water is not well known, but it is assumed that it forages over a large area extending from California southward to the coast of Central America (Howell 2012). It feeds mainly on small fish, squid and crustaceans (Carboneras et al. 2018). It breeds in summer (May-October) on two islets nearby Guadalupe islands (Carboneras et al. 2018). Nests are placed in crevices and burrows (Howell 2012). The species is temporally segregated from the co-occurring Ainsley's Storm-petrel (Hydrobates cheimomnestes), which breeds at the same sites during winter (November-April) (Howell 2012).","It is thought that Townsend’s Storm-petrel may exist locally on the main island of Guadalupe (Howell 2012). This population has likely suffered significant population declines in the past due to introduced species such as cats (thought to be the primary cause of the extinction of the Guadalupe Storm-petrel), goats (responsible for large-scale habitat degradation on Guadalupe, likely also trampling burrows) and potentially mice, present on Guadalupe (Aguirre-Muñoz et al. 2011) and known to depredate nests of the closely related Leach’s Storm-petrel (Bicknell et al. 2009). However, goats were eradicated in the mid-2000s (Aguirre-Muñoz et al. 2011) and although cats are still present on the island, they are controlled around seabird nesting sites (Aguirre-Muñoz et al. 2011), likely reducing the extend of predation. Further, the islets on which Townsend's Storm-petrel breeds are thought to be free of invasive species. Although little research currently takes place on the islets surrounding Guadalupe, it has been shown that disturbance by investigators can have significant negative impacts on the breeding success of the closely related Leach's Storm-petrel (Blackmer et al. 2004) and thus should be considered a potential threat.","In Brooke (2004), the population size for both H. cheimomnestes and H. socorroensis combined was placed at 5,000 pairs (i.e. 10,000 mature individuals). Howell (2012) suggests that for this taxon alone there may be 4,000 birds on Islote Negro and 3,000 on Islote Asfuera. Therefore, the overall population size may be best placed in the range 2,500-9,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Hydrobates socorroensis is only known to breed from May/June to October/November on the islets of Islote Negro and Islote Afuera by Guadalupe Island, Mexico (Howell 2012).

Although the population may be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is extremely large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It breeds in the high Arctic from late-May or early-June (depending on the timing of the Arctic thaw) in single pairs or loose groups, often with colonies of nesting gulls or terns (del Hoyo et al. 1992; Kear 2005); although it is not itself a colonial species (Snow and Perrins 1998). Males undergo short post-breeding moult migrations, often gathering in small or large flocks (up to 4,000 in Iceland) (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996) while females are incubating (Madge and Burn 1988). Females usually moult in the breeding grounds (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996), although large concentrations (500-1,000 individuals) of moulting females have been recorded away from breeding areas (Scott and Rose 1996). During the moulting period the species is flightless for a period of c.3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996). The autumn migration begins after the moulting period in mid-August (Scott and Rose 1996), with males tending to remain much further north than females or immatures (del Hoyo et al. 1992) leading to some sexual segregation during the winter (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and is commonly observed in small or large flocks sometimes of several thousand individuals (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005). The return spring migration generally begins in late-February (Scott and Rose 1996) although flocks of non-breeders may remain in the south, often in winter quarters, during the breeding season (Madge and Burn 1988). Habitat Breeding The species breeds in tundra, wooded tundra and moorland regions in the high Arctic, occupying small, shallow, freshwater lakes, pools and rivers with grassy shorelines and high densities of invertebrate life (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo et al. 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005). It shows a preference for water less than 6 m deep (usually 2 m) for diving (Kear 2005). Non-breeding The species winters on shallow coastal waters  less than 10 m deep (especially in the vicinity of sewage outlets), as well as sheltered bays, estuaries and brackish coastal lagoons (del Hoyo et al. 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005). It is also found inland on large lakes and reservoirs during this season (Johnsgard 1978; Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005). Diet The species is omnivorous (Kear 2005). During the winter, its diet consisting predominantly of molluscs (Johnsgard 1978) such as muscles, cockles and clams while in coastal habitats and Hydrobia snails while in brackish waters (del Hoyo et al. 1992; Kear 2005). Other food sources include insects, aquatic insect larvae, crustaceans such as amphipods, worms, small fish, and the roots, seeds and vegetative parts of aquatic plants such as sedges and water weeds (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo et al. 1992; Kear 2005). Breeding The nest is a shallow depression close to water on the ground, either in thick vegetation, in cracks in rocks, under woody shrubs or under perennial herbaceous vegetation less than 50 cm high (Iceland) (Johnsgard 1978; Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo et al. 1992; Kear 2005). The species is not colonial but it will sometimes nest among gulls and terns (Kear 2005), with neighbouring nests being placed as close as 1 m in some areas (Snow and Perrins 1998). In Scotland, UK the introduction of a sewage treatment scheme in the Firth of Forth, a large marine bay, resulted in a considerable reduction in the abundance of the species, with feeding flocks only remaining at outfalls where sewage continued to be discharged in large quantities (Campbell 1984). It was unclear whether the changes in the species's distribution were due to reductions in the number of food items borne in the sewage or to reductions in aquatic invertebrate abundance as a result of the new treatment system (Campbell 1984).","Incidental capture in commercial fisheries poses a major threat to this species which shows a relatively high vulnerability to bycatch (Sonntag et al. 2012). Entanglement in fishing equipment causes an estimated 5-10% annual mortality in the Baltic region (Jensen 2009). The species winters near major fishing areas in Europe, North America and Japan, thus interaction with fisheries is common throughout the range. Wetland habitats critical to breeding success are potentially threatened by climate change. Remotely sensed imaging has revealed landscape-level changes, including the shrinkage of ponds in subarctic Alaska, associated with a warming climate, longer growing seasons and increased potential evapotranspiration (Riordan et al. 2006). Audubon’s (2014) climate model predicts the loss of over half of the North American summer range with suitable climatic conditions, with similar trends likely in Eurasia. Climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes throughout the sensitive ecosystems in the Arctic region (Fox et al. 2015). Reduced duration of spring snow cover in boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Greater Scaup, possibly due to trophic mismatch, with a projected 12.9% decline in population by 2080, compared to the 1980 census (Drever et al. 2011). Future ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of Scaup diet (Steinacher et al. 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Certain colonies in the Pacific Northwest may be exposed to toxicologically significant levels of cadmium originating from mussels foraged from aquaculture structures, raising the possibility that heavy metal pollution could be contributory to observed population declines (Bendell 2011). The Scaup’s habit of congregating around coastal sewage outlets in winter, also exposes it to risk from other pollutants (Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Flocks often occur in vicinity of oil-related developments and are therefore susceptible to oiling and related pollutants, particularly when moulting and during winter. Oil pollution could also impact the species indirectly through decreased abundance or quality of invertebrate prey (Kirby et al. 1993, Kear 2005). Oil and gas exploration in Siberia may have disruptive impacts on breeding grounds and could potentially be associated with an increase in hunting pressures (Jensen 2009, Mineyev 1998). Wind farms may represent a threat to the Greater Scaup, having been shown to affect duck population densities more severely than those of other species groups (Stewart et al. 2007). However, it has been found that collision rates are lower than for other groups (Dürr 2013 per Fox et al. 2015) and, as such, wind farms are likely to only be damaging to the population when inappropriately placed (Drewitt &amp; Langston 2006). At present, direct persecution only appears to have a low impact on a minority of the population, with annual mortality in the EU estimated at 0.6% (Mooji 2005) or not more than 2% (Jensen 2009). In the last 10-year period with available data (2004-2014), the estimated harvest of Greater Scaup in US and Canada ranged from 56,000 to 104,000 birds and showed a decreasing trend in population size (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2015). Another study in North America found little evidence that harvest was associated with population decline (Afton and Anderson 2001). Low levels of hunting have also been reported in north-western Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006). Although wintering in densely populated coastal areas (Europe, N. America, Japan) makes the species an exposed hunting target, persecution is thought to have negligible effects on the population as a whole.","The global population is estimated to number c. 4,920,000-5,130,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016). The breeding population in Europe is estimated at 134,000-178,000 pairs, which equates to 269,000-355,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"Summer breeding grounds of the species range across the northern limits of Europe (including Iceland) and Asia, through the Aleutian Islands (year-round breeding) to Alaska (USA), and across to the Atlantic coast of Canada (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It winters further south, reaching California, the great lakes and northern Florida in North America, the Adriatic Sea and northern Black Sea in Europe, the western Caspian Sea, and on the Pacific coast of Asia as far as south-east China (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II.

Within Europe, it has experienced moderate declines which have not been compensated for by increases elsewhere in the species' range. Declines are thought to be driven by a range of threats including overharvesting of aquatic resources, pollution, disturbance and hunting. Should the declines be found to be more severe, or new information reveal declines in the S. m. sedentaria and S. m. borealis populations, then the species would warrant uplisting; it almost meets the requirements for listing as threatened under criterion A4abcde.","The Common Eider always nests on the ground, and usually in areas free of mammalian predators (Waltho and Coulson 2015), including coastal islands and islets along low-lying rocky coasts, on coastal shores and spits, on islets in brackish and freshwater lagoons, coastal lakes and rivers or on tundra pools close to the coast (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo et al. 1992; Kear 2005). They use a wide range of nesting habitats, including bare ground, shingle, grassland, scrub, under trees and in derelict buildings (Waltho and Coulson 2015). The nest is a slight hollow in the ground that is usually positioned in the shelter of rocks or vegetation but may also be in the open (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Large nesting aggregations form where safe nesting sites are at a premium (Waltho and Coulson 2015).These species typically moults on shallow marine or sheltered coastal waters free from disturbance (Kear 2005; Waltho and Coulson 2015). It winters on shallow coasts (usually &lt;10m depth), bays and estuaries (del Hoyo et al. 1992; Waltho and Coulson 2015), especially where there are high abundances of benthic molluscs, particularly Mytilus edulis (Camphuysen et al. 2002, Ens 2006, Waltho and Coulson 2015). It may also occur inland on freshwater lakes when on passage and during the winter (rarely) (Waltho and Coulson 2015). Its diet consists predominantly of benthic molluscs, especially Mytilus edulis, although a wide range of crustaceans (e.g. amphipods and isopods), echinoderms, other marine invertebrates and fish may also be taken (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Waltho and Coulson 2015). During the breeding season incubating females in the Arctic  are reported to feed on  algae, berries and the seeds and leaves of surrounding tundra plants (del Hoyo et al. 1992), while in temperate regions they do not feed, which leads to the temporary breakdown of their digestive system (Waltho and Coulson 2015, Laursen and Møller 2016), Northern populations of this species are migratory (&gt;1000km), but southern populations are largely sedentary (Waltho and Coulson 2015). Migratory nature is largely a response to coastal sea ice (Waltho and Coulson 2015).","The critical factor for the long-term survival of the species appears to be the survival rate of young ducklings (Waltho and Coulson 2015), but it is not clear which factors are causing the low duckling survival. Past mass mortality in ducklings has been caused by viral infections (1996, 1999) (Hollmén 2002), and the impact of this is likely aggravated by low availability and low nutritional quality of food supplies which is associated with poor body condition in females at the onset of the breeding season (Desholm et al. 2003). Avian cholera appears to be a potentially significant threat with mass mortality events noted at several colonies in Denmark and in Canada (Kats 2007, Descamps et al. 2012, Tjørnløv et al. 2013), and according to Descamps et al.’s (2012) model, only a few recurrent outbreaks would be sufficient to cause colony extinction within a relatively short time. Other diseases may also impact populations, e.g. Wellfleet Bay Virus has caused heavy mortality in Massachusetts, US (Ballard et al. 2012) but high parasite loads are considered to be a symptom of other detrimental impacts rather than a primary driver of decline (Kats 2007). Conflict with the shellfish aquaculture industry can have detrimental effects on certain populations (Kear 2005, Ens 2006). Over-harvesting of benthic molluscs has led to mass starvation events in the past, particularly where secondary prey resources are targeted, as with intensive fishing of Spisula clams during a period of low mussel stocks prior to a mass mortality event in 1999-2000 in the Dutch Wadden Sea and southern North Sea (Camphuysen et al. 2002, Ens 2006, Kats 2007). The species is also impacted by the extensive use of gillnets, and commonly becomes entangled and drowned in monofilament nets, and significant mortality may occur where fishing effort overlaps with Eider aggregations (Kear 2005, Žydelis et al. 2013). Levels of hunting are high within several countries within the range, and have been considered unsustainable in Russia (Nikolaeva et al. 2006), Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006) and Greenland (where annual bags exceeded 80,000 in the late 1990s) (Merkel 2004). New restrictions introduced in 2004 appear to have enabled populations to recover considerably (Merkel 2010). In North America, the harvest may still exceed sustainable levels in certain areas (Kear 2005).  Populations in the high Arctic are subject to shooting by indigenous peoples for food, especially in spring (Byers and Dickson 2001, Kear 2005), but this subsistence hunting is likely to be sustainable at current levels (Byers and Dickson 2001). An associated threat is that of lethal and sub-lethal lead exposure through ingestion of lead shot by adult birds, with 23% of females dying of emancipation after incubation were diagnosed with severe or sub-clinical lead poisoning (Hollmén 2002), and 22% of birds collected through hunting in Greenland over three years carried embedded shot pellets (Falk et al. 2006). The species is vulnerable to chronic coastal oil pollution and to major oil spills especially in areas where large moulting and wintering concentrations occur (Kear 2005, Nikolaeva et al. 2006, Waltho and Coulson 2015, Carboneras et al. 2017). While one major incident has the potential to be disastrous, levels of chronic oil-related mortality appears relatively stable in the southern North Sea and Wadden Sea, at between 4-12% of estimated winter mortality (Camphuysen et al. 2002). Disturbance from the development of mineral resources along the coast (Nikolaeva et al. 2006) and from local shore-based activities such as angling and dog walking increases the likelihood of predation on young (Keller 1991). Other recreational activities such as boat tours (Burnham et al. 2012), as well as scientific research (Bolduc and Guillemette 2003) are also likely to reduce productivity at certain locations (Keller 1991). In winter, unregulated tourism and shipping also cause disturbance to the species, and may prevent access to favoured feeding grounds (Nikolaeva et al. 2006). Additional threats include predation of breeding females in Europe by the increased population of White-tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla and nest predation by introduced mink Mustela vison (Kats 2007, Ekroos et al. 2012) and in the Americas by introduced foxes Vulpes spp. (Petersen et al. 2015). Increasing incidence of nesting in tight association with gull colonies and in less exposed sites, may reflect antipredator responses. The species may also be sensitive to the effects of climate change, though assessing the impacts on population dynamics is problematic as negative effects (e.g. lower growth in prey leading to reduced food availability [Carboneras et al. 2012]) are confounded by potential positive impacts deriving from earlier arrival on breeding grounds improving breeding success in some areas (D’Alba et al. 2010). Mussel quality, and subsequent eider breeding condition, increases with higher nutrient content of coastal waters (Laursen and Møller 2014) so recent reductions in the level of eutrophication of near-shore waters may have contributed to lower food availability.  Thiamine deficiency has been linked to a lethal paralytic syndrome that has caused mass mortality of Eider ducklings. Unlike Herring Gulls Larus argentatus, Common Eider females will lay eggs even below the critical threshold of thiamine, with resultant rapid mortality in hatchlings (Balk et al. 2009). The extent to which this impacts the population is unknown, and is unlikely to account for the strongly skewed sex ratio observed in the species (Lehikoinen et al. 2008). However, the causes of lethal thiamine deficiency need further investigation as there may be a widespread pollutant present that is currently unidentified. Sand and gravel extraction destroys habitats of benthic organisms, with potential reverberations up the trophic chain. In the Baltic, the impact is thought to be sufficiently low to not cause declines (Skov et al. 2011).","The global population is estimated to number c. 3,300,000-4,000,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2012), which equates to 1,580,000-1,910,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). The European population is estimated at 791,000-955,000 pairs.",Unknown,"The breeding range of this species is widely distributed around the mid- to high-latitude coasts of the northern hemisphere, particularly at the higher latitudes. It has a Holarctic distribution, being present in both Eurasia and North America. However, its distribution is not continuous across the Holarctic. There are distinct and persistent gaps in both the central parts of the Russian Arctic and the Canadian Arctic. The distributional gap in Russia (54° longitude) is considerably wider than that in Canada (6° longitude). These gaps can be attributed to the presence of ice all year round at these locations, especially landfast sea ice. At the highest latitudes, the presence of breeding birds is largely limited by the distribution of ice-free conditions during June.In winter, the range is more compressed, with migratory northern populations largely wintering within the range of the southerly sedentary populations (Waltho and Coulson 2015). The southern limits of regular wintering ranges are southern Alaska (USA) at 51°N, New Jersey (USA) at 41°N, W France at 44°N and Kuril Islands (Russia) at 50°N (Waltho and Coulson 2015).Globally there are six widely recognised subspecies (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Waltho and Coulson 2015), with four in Eurasia: European (S. mollissima mollissima), Faroes (S. m. faeroeensis), Northern (S. m. borealis) and Pacific (S. mollissima v-nigrum). There are four subspecies in North America: Pacific (S. mollissima v-nigra), American (S. m. dresseri), Hudson Bay (S. m. sedentaria), and Northern (S. m. borealis) (Bowman et al. 2015).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayEU Birds Directive Annex II and III. CMS Appendix II. Changes to hunting regulations in Greenland in 2001 shortened the length of the hunting season which is thought to have led to a rapid increase in population size (Burnham et al. 2012). However the hunting regulations have recently changed and the effect on the population is not yet known. Restrictions were also introduced in Denmark in 2004/2005 and 2011/2012 with the aim of reducing the proportion of female birds killed and increasing the population growth rate (Christensen and Hounisen 2014).Conservation and Research Actions ProposedSustainable levels of hunting should be established in those areas where the species is harvested and legislation established and enforced to ensure this. Conduct flyway-scale winter counts (Ekroos et al. 2012) and ensure monitoring is coordinated across the species's range (I. K. Petersen in litt. 2015). Key areas should be protected from all forms of disturbance including oil exploration, drilling and transportation. Further research is needed into impacts of declining nutrient levels in coastal waters and their effects on mussel populations, and the subsequent effects of this on site carrying capacity, body condition and subsequent breeding productivity, across the species range. Levels of shellfish harvesting should be monitored to ensure sustainability and measures to minimise bycatch in fishing nets promoted amongst fisheries.

The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It breeds from late-June onwards, usually in well-dispersed solitary pairs, although in some areas it may also form loose colonies (Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo et al. 1992; Kear 2005). Males gather in vast flocks between July and August and undertake moult migrations to favoured marine areas often more than a thousand miles from the breeding grounds (Snow and Perrins 1998; Johnsgard 1978). The autumn migration to winter quarters, by both males and females), peaks between August and October, with stragglers still leaving the breeding grounds during September (Snow and Perrins 1998). The timing of the return passage in the spring is determined by the ice conditions and the thawing of inland breeding waters (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding birds generally oversummer south of the breeding range or may remain on the wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is highly gregarious when not breeding, migrating in groups of up to c.1,000 individuals ( and aggregating into enormous flocks during the moulting period (e.g. 100,000 individuals off the western coast of Greenland)) and during the winter (Johnsgard 1978; Madge and Burn 1988; Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on dry Artic tundra near freshwater lakes, pools, bogs, marshes, streams and small rivers the coast or up to 50 km (rarely up to 100 km) inland (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005; Madge and Burn 1988). It shows a preference for shallow fresh waters with emergent vegetation for initial brood rearing, afterwards moving to more saline waters where the young fledge (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). Non-breeding The species generally moults in sheltered fjords and bays with high densities of benthic fauna (Kear 2005), and winters at sea on deep offshore waters close to the edge of sea ice or in coastal areas with shallow waters (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005).Diet Its diet consists predominantly of animal matter such as benthic molluscs, crustaceans, larval insects (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (e.g. caddisflies and midges), echinoderms (e.g. sea urchins and sand dollars) and other marine invertebrates, although the seeds and the vegetative parts of tundra plants, sedges and aquatic plants may also be taken on the breeding grounds, and algae, eelgrass Zostera spp. and Ruppia maritima may be taken at sea (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is a slight hollow on dry ground and is usually positioned near water, in the open, or under the cover of driftwood, grass hummocks or rocks (Flint et al. 1984; del Hoyo et al. 1992).","Levels of hunting in this species are poorly regulated in parts of the range and may be unsustainable in some areas. Two to five percent of the population has been harvested annually in Alaska and Canada in recent years (Powell et al. 2012), accounting for 16,000 individuals (Rothe et al. 2015). Harvesting levels can reach 6.9% in the Northwest Territories (Byers and Dickson 2001), while in south west Greenland there has been an estimate of between 10-20% of the winter population killed annually (Hansen 2002). No data is available for Russia. In one study covering the wintering population in southwest Greenland, 22% of adults carried embedded lead shots (Falk et al. 2006). Lethal and sub-lethal levels of lead have also been detected in related Spectacled Eiders Somateria fischeri in Alaska where they are thought to be reducing survival rates (Grand et al. 1998, Flint et al. 2016). Given their overlapping ranges and similar ecologies, King Eiders are likely to be affected in a similar way. The species is also vulnerable to mortality from bycatch, with 100-200 individuals killed per year around Nuuk, Greenland. Bycatch of all eider species has been reported in Newfoundland, Iceland, Norway, Germany and the Baltic Sea (Merkel 2004). Oil spills poses an additional threat, a small spill in the Pribilof Islands in 1997 caused high Eider mortality. Should an oil spill occur in the eastern Chukchi Sea, a primary staging area for King Eiders during autumn and spring migrations, it would be expected to cause a population decline of between 2.1-3.4% a year in northern Alaska (Bentzen and Powell 2012). Oil fields have been developed in areas where King Eider nests in northern Alaska, but no decline in numbers has been documented (Powell et al. 2012), with pollution from spills being a greater threat than the disturbance of oil exploration activities and development of platforms. Climate change poses an ongoing and future threat to the species through ocean acidification and habitat shifting. Decreased pH values of seawater may lead to declines in molluscs which are key prey items in eider diets (Steinacher et al. 2009, USFWS 2010, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Remote sensing has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes and ponds in Alaska and Siberia (Smith et al. 2005, Riordan et al. 2006) which could constitute breeding habitat loss. However, no link between wetland loss and population decline has been demonstrated. Climate change is still predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the sensitive Arctic region (Fox et al. 2015), likely to alter the population dynamics of this high arctic species.","The global population is estimated to number c.800,000-900,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015), while the population in Russia has been estimated at c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals (Brazil 2009). The European population is estimated at 37,500-45,500 pairs, which equates to 75,000-91,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"The King Eider breeds along the Arctic coasts of Europe, North America and Asia.

Further studies are needed to determine the causes of these declines, and whether some populations may have shifted to unsurveyed areas within the range.","Behaviour This species is migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It begins to breed in June, nesting sometimes in single pairs in very low densities (roughly one pair per 100 acres was recorded on the Kashunuk River in the 1960s) (Johnsgard 1978), but occasionally in small colonies of up to 60+ nests (Kear 2005). Around the time of hatching, males gather in large flocks off the coast near the breeding ground (Johnsgard 1978). Shortly after hatching, the female moves her brood to the coast where they form 'herds' (Johnsgard 1978). The species migrates up to 3000km to its moulting sites (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005), where it becomes flightless for a period, before some continue migration to more distant wintering sites (Petersen et al. 2006). The timing of the moult migration appears to be highly variable, occurring sometimes as early as August, but in some years not until November, in which case the moult occurs prior to arrival (Johnsgard 1978). On the moulting grounds it forms flocks that may exceed 50,000 birds (Laubhan and Metzner 1999, Kear 2005). Congregations of a similar size also occur also in the spring when pair formation occurs prior to departure for the breeding grounds (Kear 2005). Spring migration commences in March in East Asia (Kear 2005). Elsewhere it begins in April, usually peaking in May (Kear 2005). Arrivals on the breeding grounds begin in early June (Kear 2005). Some small flocks remain throughout the summer in the wintering quarters at Varangerfjiord (Kear 2005). Habitat Breeding This species regularly breeds several kilometres inland (Kear 2005). It inhabits pools of various shapes and sizes in areas that characterise flat coastal belt within open tundra (Kear 2005). In the Lena Delta and Barrow areas it favours moss-lichen polygonal tundra (Kear 2005). It forages in areas of fresh, saline or brackish water, as well as in tidal flats (Johnsgard 1978). Following hatching all birds move to coastal habitats (Johnsgard 1978). Non-breeding It winters mostly at sea, along low-lying rocky coasts, frequenting bays and river mouths (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It forages in water that is less than 10m deep (Madge and Burn 1988), and particularly favours areas where freshwater streams enter the sea (Madge and Burn 1988). Diet It feeds chiefly on molluscs, crustaceans and other marine invertebrates (del Hoyo et al. 1992). During the breeding season, some freshwater prey is taken including chironomid and caddisfly larvae (Johnsgard 1978). During moult, bivalve molluscs are the primary food source (Petersen 1981). Breeding site Nests are built on small hummocks or in depressions between hummocks, usually within a few metres of a tundra pond, and are often well-concealed by grass (Johnsgard 1978). The nests are deep and lined with lichens, grass and down (Kear 2005).","Through a variety of effects, climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Recent dramatic changes in Arctic sea ice extent and thickness north of Alaska and Russia may affect eiders in unknown ways. In addition, climate change is causing the loss of Arctic tundra ponds (Andresen and Lougheed 2015), which could be contributing to declines in the species. In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox et al. 2015). Increased predation may also result from climate-related collapses in the pattern of cyclical abundance of rodents, as predators target alternative prey in the absence of their main food (Quakenbush et al. 2004, Iles et al. 2013). Habitat loss also occurs through prospecting for, and the exploitation of, natural resources such as oil and gas (Kear 2005). The increasing traffic of tankers carrying oil from Arctic areas imposes the risk of contamination following spills (Kear 2005). There are concerns in Alaska that a road-building project approved by the United States Congress in 2009 may impact the species (Morse 2009). Disease and water pollution may impact eiders in their wintering area in south-west Alaska. It is not currently clear which of these many factors is driving the overall decline (K. Laing in litt. 2004, Žydelis et al. 2006). Over-hunting in Siberia and in other breeding areas may be impacting Steller's Eider populations while large numbers may be taken during the spring migration, though data on levels are poor (Pihl 1997). Subsistence hunting has been ongoing in Alaska since the late 19th century and may have affected breeding populations in this area (Fredrickson 2001). Studies at Barrow indicate that the historical and ongoing use of lead shot in hunting causes lead poisoning, despite being made illegal in a nationwide ban in 1991 (Morse 2009). Eiders breeding in Russia are also subject to human subsistence harvest and exposure to lead shot, where declines in the number of wintering birds on Bering Island, Russia appear to be greater on the west coast near the only village on the island; new protective zones are being proposed there (Y. Artukhin per K. Laing in litt. 2007). Males are subject to particular hunting pressure as they arrive on moulting grounds before females (Morse 2009). Another threat is mortality resulting from bycatch in gillnet fisheries, which has been documented in Lithuanian waters (Dagys and Žydelis 2002) and resource competition from shellfisheries. Redistribution is likely to have reduced bycatch in some areas, but the foraging ecology of the species puts it at risk from bycatch where they overlap with fishing fleets, for example in Estonia (Skov et al. 2011, Žydelis et al. 2013). Nest predation by mammalian and avian predators such as Arctic Fox Vulpes lagopus, Snowy Owl Nyctea scandiaca and Pomarine Jaeger Stercorarius pomarinus appears to be a threat on Alaskan breeding grounds. No nesting was observed near Barrow between 2001 and 2004, but nesting has since occurred with some success following the inception of fox control in 2005 (Safine 2011). Increasing human habitation of Arctic regions has increased the range and numbers of Ravens Corvus corax and some large gulls, leading to a greater predation pressures (Kear 2005).","Various population estimates include: c.10,000-15,000 wintering individuals in north Norway and the south-east Baltic (based on a count of 4,297 off Kola Peninsula in April 2003 [Krasnov et al. 2004], 2,300 in the whole Baltic in 2009 (Skov et al., 2011) and c.2,700 wintering off Norway in the same year (Aarvak et al. 2012) Ce.100,000-110,000 wintering individuals were counted in the north Pacific; counts in North America declined from 137,900 in 1992 to 77,300 in 2003, forming the basis of the 2003 North American population estimate of 90,000-95,000 individuals (K.

The minimum European population in winter is currently estimated at 30,800-41,200 individuals, which equates to 20,500-27,500 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). There is also a marginal breeding population in Europe estimated at 5-50 pairs, which equates to 10-100 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Based on the current European wintering population estimate of 30,800-41,200 individuals (BirdLife International 2015) and an estimate of 100,000-110,000 individuals wintering in the north Pacific, the total population is estimated at c.130,000-150,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"This species breeds between the Kolyma Delta and the Yamal Peninsula, Russia, and on the Arctic plain of Alaska, U.S.A. (C.

It feeds mainly on insects and their larvae in summer, catching molluscs and crustaceans in winter. Feeding mostly occurs by diving, but also dabbling and head-dipping in shallow water. Breeding begins in May or June, nesting on the ground concealed in vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","Wintering areas are highly clustered, and the species demonstrates very high site fidelity (95% of radio-tracked females remained in the same region in which they were tagged [Iveson and Esler 2006]), which makes the species vulnerable to the impacts from large oil spills. Number of wintering birds were 25% lower in oiled areas following the Exxon Valdez spill, and still showed reduced survival rates 11-14 years after the incident, suggesting chronic oil contamination. Full recovery after the catastrophic Exxon Valdez spill was estimated to take 24 years (Iveson and Esler 2010). The species is threatened by the development of hydroelectric schemes which result in the diversion and siltation of rivers (Tucker and Heath 1994, Carboneras and Kirwan 2013). Damming is affecting populations in Europe, Newfoundland and to a lesser extent, the West coast of North America. One colony has already been lost due to diversion of the river Thorisos, following the installation of a hydroelectric dam. Hunting occurs at low levels throughout the species’ range, with small bag limits in most areas (e.g. 134 annually in western Washington between 2004-2014), and although more than 1,000 are taken annually in Alaska (Sea Duck Joint Venture 2015), the annual level of subsistence harvest is estimated at an additional 2,080 birds (Rothe et al. 2015). The large-scale introduction of Atlantic Salmon (Salmo samar) and Brown Trout (Salmo trutta) can result in competition for blackfly larvae and pupae, the duck's main food source. In the 1930s American Mink (Mustela vison) were introduced to the European range and may have reduced breeding success although the impact has not been quantified (Tucker and Heath 1994). Dredging for minerals in Lake Mývatn may affect algal blooms which form another important food source (Tucker and Heath 1994).","The global population is estimated to number c.190,000-380,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015), the population in Russia is estimated at c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals (Brazil 2009). The European population is estimated at 4,000-7,000 pairs, which equates to 8,000-14,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Increasing,"The Harlequin Duck is found in north-western and north-eastern North America, eastern Russia, the Aleutian Islands, southern Greenland and Iceland.

This rate of decline implies that the global population will undergo at least a ≥30 decline over three generations (1993-2020), even when factoring-in uncertainty regarding the sizes and trends of other populations. Improved knowledge regarding populations outside the Baltic Sea might lead to the species being uplisted to Endangered if the overall rate of decline can be confidently shown to be very rapid.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory although its movements are poorly understood (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996). It breeds from late-May onward in single pairs or loose groups (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005), the males leaving the females soon after the start of incubation (between late-June and early-September) to gather in small flocks for a flightless moulting period (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996). Some populations undergo extensive moult migrations of up to 1,000 km, while others moult on waters near the breeding grounds (Madge and Burn 1988). Females moult between early-August and early-October on the breeding grounds (Scott and Rose 1996), often abandoning their young at the start of the moult which then gather into large parentless groups (Johnsgard 1978). The southward autumn migration occurs from September to October after the post-breeding moult (Scott and Rose 1996) and non-breeders may oversummer in the wintering areas (Madge and Burn 1988). Outside of the breeding season the species is highly gregarious, in winter gathering into large aggregations of perhaps several tens of thousands of individuals to roost or to feed in inshore and offshore waters (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species is diurnal and regularly dives to depths of 3-10 m when foraging, with a maximum dive depth of 50-60 m (Kear 2005). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on marshy grass tundra in the high Arctic, especially where habitat mosaics are formed by hummocks and ridges together with moist depressions, freshwater lakes, bogs, slow rivers or pools of standing water, it is common among willows or dwarf birch in the arctic-alpine zone (Scandinavia) (Flint et al. 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). It generally avoids wooded tundra (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). The species also breeds on small rocky islands off mainland Arctic coasts and on larger offshore islands, using promontories, deltas, coastal inlets and islets in fjords (Greenland) (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding The species winters at sea, generally far offshore in waters 10-35 m deep, as well as in saline, brackish or fresh estuarine waters, brackish lagoons , and inland (very rarely) on large, deep freshwater lakes (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996). Diet The species shows a preference for marine foods during both the breeding and non-breeding seasons (Johnsgard 1978), its diet consisting predominantly of animal matter such as crustaceans (e.g. amphipods and cladocerans), molluscs, other marine invertebrates (e.g. echinoderms, worms) and fish (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). The species also takes freshwater insects and insect larvae ands well as plant material such as algae, grasses, and the seeds and fruits of tundra plants (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is a natural depression on dry ground positioned in the open, amongst vegetation, partially hidden by overhanging boulders or under low shrubs (e.g. willows or dwarf birch) usually close to water (Johnsgard 1978, Flint et al. 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992). Although it is not a colonial species some pairs may nest in loose groups, and the species may also nest in association with Arctic Terns (Kear 2005).","A major decline observed in the wintering population of the Long-tailed Duck in the Baltic Sea coincides with heavy bycatch mortality in gillnet fisheries, with an estimate of at least 90,000 birds (of different species) killed annually (Žydelis et al. 2009). This species is highly susceptible to gillnet mortality and is the most frequently recorded victim in the eastern and south eastern Baltic Sea (Skov et al. 2011), with annual mortality estimates ranging from 1 to 5% for the total Baltic Sea population (Bellebaum et al. 2013). Age ratios of gillnet victims in the southern Baltic suggest a decline in breeding success of c.75% over the 20th century (J. Bellebaum in litt. 2012). The effects of chronic oil pollution from small-scale oil discharges in non-breeding areas is a significant threat as Long-tailed Ducks form large aggregations that overlap with major shipping and oil transportation routes. Further expansion of such activity in the northern part of the range is likely to increase the scope of this threat (Hearn et al. 2015). Large, catastrophic oil spills still occur, although the frequency of incidence has reduced (Hearn et al. 2015). Industrial activity within the breeding range poses a threat through direct mortality from oil pollution (Gorski et al. 1977, Kirby et al. 1993, Y. and O. Mineev in litt. 2012, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017) as well as the degradation and loss of wetland habitat due to petroleum pollution, drainage and peat-extraction (Grishanov 2006). Sand and gravel extraction destroys habitats of benthic organisms, which are key prey items. In the Baltic, these activities are currently occurring at insufficient levels to be responsible for declines in waterbirds (Skov et al. 2011). A mortality event in 2006-2007 ascribed to pollution resulted in ‘several thousand’ dead Long-tailed Ducks being washed up along the Hatpudirskaya bay coast (Y. and O. Mineev in litt. 2012). Development of large offshore wind farms could have negative effects on the species, through restricting access to foraging areas and by altering the suitability of benthic habitat. The species has previously suffered heavy losses from avian cholera outbreaks (Friend 2006) and is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Future outbreaks of disease may be expected and may compound observed declines in parts of the range. The introduced Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus has become established in the Baltic where it feeds on benthic invertebrates and could affect food supplies for Long-tailed Ducks, with unknown severity of impact (Almquist et al. 2010, Dagys 2017). The Round Goby appear to considerably reduce mussel density in shallow water (less than 20 m) in the Baltic Sea, and the numbers of Long-tailed Duck in these areas have decreased correspondingly (Hearn et al. 2015). The species is still hunted across the majority of its range (Hearn et al. 2015, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). The mortality from hunting has fallen considerably in line with the recorded decline in the species, partly due to reduced numbers of birds available but also as a result of tighter regulation and fewer active hunters (Hearn et al. 2015). However, bag size has recently increased in Finland (19,400 birds in 2013), which may reflect greater numbers present during winter (Hearn et al. 2015). The sustainability of present-day hunting levels is unclear, but these populations are already subject to significant mortality from other threats so require close monitoring. Previous hunting levels cannot be assumed to have been sustainable, and better quantification of additive mortality from all threats is needed to be confident in the size of any harvestable surplus (Hearn et al. 2015). The results of autumn migration monitoring at various Baltic sites show that juveniles now represent a very low proportion of the population (Hario et al. 2009, Ellermaa et al. 2010), indicating that insufficient young are being raised to compensate for adult mortality (low recruitment). This low breeding success has been linked to the collapse of the formerly distinctive 3-4 year cycle of Arctic rodent abundance since the mid-1990s as a consequence of climate change, which may lead to greater rates of predation on alternative prey (Hario 2009, Iles et al. 2013). However, breeding success also appears to have declined in locations where rodents are absent, with poor female condition leading to bypassed breeding (A. Kondratyev in litt. 2012). In addition, ocean acidification may impact mollusc density and quality, further reducing prey availability (Steinacher et al. 2009). More information about the effects of climate change on lower trophic levels is required, but prey density and size is likely to be impacted by changes in sea temperature, and key foraging ecologies may be altered, but there is uncertainty over whether resources are lost or have shifted their distribution.","The global population is estimated to number 3,200,000 to 3,750,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2017).",Decreasing,"This species has a circumpolar range, breeding on the Arctic coasts of North America (Canada, Alaska, U.S.A. and Greenland), Europe (Iceland and Norway), and Asia (Russia). It winters at sea further south, as far as the United Kingdom, South Carolina and Washington in the United States, Korea on the Asian Pacific coast, and other areas including the Black Sea and Caspian Sea (del Hoyo et al. 1992). According to monitoring data from the Baltic Sea, where the western Siberian and northern European populations winter, the population there has declined significantly since the early 1990s at least (Hario et al. 2009, Ellermaa et al. 2010, Nilsson and Månsson 2010, Skov et al. 2011). An estimated total of c.4,272,000 individuals was counted there in 1992-1993, falling to c.1,486,000 individuals in 2007-2009, which suggests that a decline of c.65% has occurred over a period of 16 years (Skov et al. 2011). Research on the tundra of eastern European Russia since 1973 suggests that a steep decline may have occurred there (Y. and O. Mineev in litt. 2012). There is no evidence to suggest that the geographical distribution of this population has shifted sufficiently to account for this decline (Skov et al. 2011, L. Nilsson in litt. 2011, J. Bellebaum in litt. 2012, M. Ellermaa in litt. 2012), though small increases in wintering numbers have been recorded in Finland. The estimation of a real and severe decline is supported by data from migration bottlenecks in the Gulf of Finland where the numbers observed on migration have fallen dramatically since the early 1990s at least (A. Lehikoinen et al. in litt. 2012). North America holds the second largest population (c.1 million birds [Wetlands International 2017]). The Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey (WBPHS) indicates large declines from the early 1950s but a relatively stable population since 1989 (Flint 2013); on a shorter time-scale, the population appears to have declined from 1980 to 2002 and then increased from 2007 to 2012 (Bowman et al. 2015). Population trends vary among regional surveys; breeding numbers on the Arctic Coastal Plain were stable during 1986-2012 but increasing 2003-2012; on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta breeding numbers were stable during 1988-2012 but decreased during 2003-2012; on western Victoria Island, Northwest Territories, breeding numbers probably decreased from 1992-94 to 2004-05; and on Kodiak Island, Alaska, wintering numbers were stable during 1991-2005 (Raven and Dickson 2006; Zwiefelhofer et al. 2008; Stehn et al. 2013; Bowman et al. 2015). However, this species is especially poorly monitored because its breeding distribution is largely outside the area covered by breeding waterfowl surveys, and because of its offshore distribution during winter and the lack of comprehensive winter surveys (T. Bowman in litt. 2012). No trend data are available for the third largest population (c.1,600,000 birds [Wetlands International 2017]), which breeds in western Siberia and winters off eastern Asia. The fourth and smallest population (c.36,000–99,000 birds [Wetlands International 2017]), which breeds in Greenland and Iceland and winters in the north Atlantic, is poorly monitored and trends are uncertain, although it may have been stable until the 1990s (Wetlands International 2017). ","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II.

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure).

It feeds chiefly on molluscs, but also eats crustaceans, worms, echinoderms and, mainly in summer; insects and their larvae and plant material, feeding mostly by diving. Its breeding season begins in May or June, when it breeds in single pairs or loose groups in shallow depressions poorly lined with grass and some feathers (del Hoyo et al. 1996) .","Hunting poses a major threat to this species, with an estimated harvest of 18,000 to 45,000 individuals taken in the 10-year period from 2004-2014 in the US and Canada, but with a downward trend (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2015). A recent estimate suggests that the harvest of Surf Scoters may be 22-37% over the maximum sustainable rate for the east coast and 60-66% for the west coast (Koneff et al. 2017). Climate change is affecting the species through habitat loss and causing trophic mismatch. Decreasing snow cover duration during spring in boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch, with a projected 31.0% decline in the population by 2080 compared to 1980 (Drever et al. 2011). Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of the Surf Scoter diet (Steinacher et al. 2009; Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Wetlands provide important breeding grounds for this species, but are now at risk of loss or degradation; remote sensing and imaging has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes and ponds in Alaska and Siberia (Smith et al. 2005, Riordan et al. 2006). In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox et al. 2015). The species is one of the most vulnerable seabirds to oil pollution (Anderson et al. 2015) and was one of the most severely affected species in the 2007 Cosco Busan oil spill in San Francisco Bay with an estimated mortality of 4% (Ford et al. 2009). Pollution from oil and gas exploration is a pervasive threat in the Arctic which is likely to increase in the future (Poland et al. 2003, Henderson and Loe 2014). Sea ducks in the Pacific Northwest could be exposed to toxicologically significant levels of cadmium associated with mussels foraged from aquaculture structures, which raises the possibility that such exposure could be contributing to observed population declines (Bendell 2011). Although surveys have found dead individuals of this species in recovered derelict fishing gear in Salient Sea, Washington (Good et al. 2009), bycatch does not appear to be a major source of mortality in other regions (Hamel et al. 2009).","The global population is estimated to number c.250,000-1,300,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2006), while the population in Russia has been estimated at &lt;100 breeding pairs (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"The Surf Scoter can be found in North America, breeding inland from western Alaska (USA) through central Canada to Labrador, and wintering from the Aleutian Islands down to Baja California (Mexico) on the Pacific coast, and along the Atlantic coast of the USA as far south as South Carolina (del Hoyo et al. 1996) .","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour Most of this species is fully migratory although it may only travel short distances (Kear 2005), and certain populations in the north-west of Europe may also be sedentary (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species breeds from April in solitary pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1992), after which it undertakes short northerly moult migrations to coastal areas, large lakes and rivers (Kear 2005) to undergo a period of flightless moult lasting 3-4 weeks (males leave for this moult migration first while females are still incubating) (Scott and Rose 1996). Large moult gatherings are common during this period, males arriving at such gatherings in early-June and numbers peaking in late-August when adult females arrive (Scott and Rose 1996). The southward autumn migration begins in late-August with most arriving in the winter quarters by early-December (Scott and Rose 1996). Females tend to migrate further than males and juveniles migrate further than adults (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996). The return migration to the breeding areas occurs as early as mid-February, the species timing its arrival to coincide with the thawing and appearance of open water (Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005). Non-breeders may also over-summer on wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is gregarious outside of the breeding season usually being observed in small scattered groups or in small flocks on migration (Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). Several hundred individuals may roost together (Snow and Perrins 1998) and large flocks often gather to feed at sewage outfalls (del Hoyo et al. 1992) during the winter, although the species rarely occurs in very large flocks (Scott and Rose 1996). Habitat The species is restricted to water close to the shore and less than 10 m deep, showing a preference for waters 4 m deep (Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding When breeding the species shows a preference for oligotrophic lakes devoid of fish but with abundant invertebrate life (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005), and requires tree-holes (or artificial nestboxes) for nesting (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Suitable habitats include freshwater lakes, pools, rivers and deep marshes surrounded by coniferous forest (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992). Non-breeding The species winters mainly at sea on inshore waters, shallow bays, estuaries and coastal lagoons (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005), especially in the vicinity of sewage outfalls (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Further to the south and on migration the species may also frequent large rivers, lakes and reservoirs (Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005). Diet The diet of the species consists predominantly of aquatic invertebrates such as molluscs, worms, crustaceans, aquatic insects and insect larvae (e.g. dragonflies, damsel flies and may flies) (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992), as well as amphibians, small fish and some plant material (mainly in the autumn) such as seeds, roots and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The species nests in hollows of mature trees (e.g. aspen, spruce or oak) formed by woodpeckers or by bacterial or fungal heart-rot invasions that have internal cavity diameters of c.20 cm, although the height of the hollow does not seem to be important (Johnsgard 1978, Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005). The species will preferentially nest in trees in open stands near water or solitary trees on the edges of marshes, rather than in trees in dense stands in order to increase the ease of entry by flying (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988). The species will also nest in artificial nest-boxes (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Management information In Scotland, UK the introduction of a sewage treatment scheme in the Firth of Forth (a large marine bay) resulted in a considerable reduction in the abundance of the species, with feeding flocks only remaining at outfalls where sewage continued to be discharged in large quantities (Campbell 1984). It was unclear whether the changes in the species's distribution were due to reductions in the number of food items borne in the sewage or to reductions in aquatic invertebrate abundance as a result of the new treatment system (Campbell 1984). In some areas nestbox erection programmes have been shown to cause significant range expansions and population increases (Dennis 1987, del Hoyo et al. 1992), although an experiment in southern Finland found that even though nestbox provision increased breeding numbers of the species there was a negative density-dependent effect on reproductive output (i.e. the number of fledged young did not increase despite an increase in breeding pairs) (Poysa and Poysa 2002). Nesting habitats in general may also benefit from a more extended rotation of timber harvesting (Kear 2005).","The species is threatened by wetland degradation and loss in North America and is susceptible to atmospheric acid deposition (e.g. acid rain) throughout a large part of its breeding range (Kear 2005). The main threat to the species in its wintering range is pollution, e.g. from coastal oil spills or other pollutants from sewage outfalls (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Modern forestry management work is also limiting the suitable area of breeding habitat by removing old and decaying trees with likely nest holes (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The timber industry is thought to be compromising the population in large parts of the range. The placing of nest-boxes to compensate for the loss of natural nesting sites has not been very effective, as the species reaches an apparent density-dependent plateau in breeding success (Finland), which may indicate that nesting resource is not the primary limiting factor constraining the population. However, in other parts of the species' range (North America) use of nest-boxes has been found to increase the breeding range and productivity of Common Goldeneye. Historically, an estimated 100,000–250,000 were shot annually in north-west and central Europe. The species is still hunted at sustainable levels in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006), while hunting elsewhere has unquantified effects on the global populations (Kear 2005), though not thought to drive any significant declines. Lead shot ingestion does not appear to be a significant risk, at least when compared to some other species of seaducks (Carboneras et al. 2014). The introduction of invertebrate-eating fish such as Perch, Perca spp., to many lakes where they were not formerly present leads to increased resource competition which has been experimentally shown to negatively affect the Common Goldeneye (Nummi et al. 2016).","The global population is estimated to number c.2,700,000-4,700,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

However, this species is thought to be resistant to this threat due to its ability to switch to other prey types (Bicknell et al. 2013). Despite this, the extent of this threat is at yet unknown, but may rapidly lead to great decreases in breeding success. Decreases in North Sea Sandeel stocks has led to reduced prey availability in some areas of the Great Skua’s range, especially in northern Scotland, which has seen declines in Great Skua population and breeding success (Furness et al. 2018) This, however, may represent population shifts as opposed to actual declines, as colonies in south Scotland have increased over the same period (Furness et al. 2018). Localised persecution of this species occurs in colonies in Iceland, the Faroes, northern Scotland and across Scandinavia in order to alleviate stresses to other seabirds and due to the species' aggressive behaviour towards humans during the breeding season.

Whilst breeding, it specialises on catching lemmings, which frequently constitute over 90% of their diet. It also feeds on young waders and gamebirds, bird eggs and carrion. In winter, it takes fish, sometimes by kleptoparasitism, small seabirds, and carrion. Breeding begins in June at scattered sites across the tundra where lemming concentrations are high. Individuals are highly territorial. Outside the breeding season, it migrates south, including long migrations over land (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","The productivity of this species is thought to fluctuate in accordance with changes in the population of lemmings, a key prey item during the breeding season (Maher 1974).

It generally remains gregarious throughout the year (Snow and Perrins 1998) and may roost in large flocks during the winter (Richards 1990). Habitat Breeding The species chiefly breeds inland and shows a preference for shallow, calm (Snow and Perrins 1998), temporarily flooded wetland habitats (del Hoyo et al. 1996) with lush vegetation (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It forms nesting colonies on the margins of lakes (Flint et al. 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996), lagoons (Flint et al. 1984, Snow and Perrins 1998), slow-flowing rivers, deltas, estuaries (Snow and Perrins 1998) and on tussocky marshes (Flint et al. 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996), but may also nest on the upper zones of saltmarshes (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), coastal dunes and offshore islands in more coastal areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species will also utilise artificial sites such as sewage ponds, gravel- and clay-pits, ponds, canals and floodlands (Snow and Perrins 1998) and may nest on the dry ground of heather moors, sand-dunes, beaches (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) and stony islets (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding During the winter the species is most common in coastal habitats (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and tidal inshore waters, showing a preference for inlets or estuaries with sandy or muddy beaches, and generally avoiding rocky or exposed coastlines (Snow and Perrins 1998). It may also occur inland during this season, frequenting ploughed fields, moist grasslands, urban parks, sewage farms, refuse tips, reservoirs, ponds and ornamental waters (Snow and Perrins 1998), and roosts on sandy and gravel sites or on inland reservoirs (Richards 1990). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of aquatic and terrestrial insects, earthworms and marine invertebrates (e.g. molluscs, crustaceans and marine worms) (del Hoyo et al. 1996) although it may also take fish (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (usually dead or sick) (Flint et al. 1984), rodents (e.g. voles) (Flint et al. 1984) and agricultural grain (del Hoyo et al. 1996). During the non-breeding season the species may rely heavily on artificial food sources provided by man, especially in Western Europe (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and often scavenges from refuse tips during this period (Richards 1990). Breeding site The nest is a rough construction of vegetation (Richards 1990) based on a shallow scrape (Snow and Perrins 1998) and placed on a floating mat, in broken reeds, on a hummock, or sometimes on dry, grassy or sandy ground (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996).

The species breeds from late-June in mixed-species colonies and subcolonies occasionally as large as 2,000 individuals, sometimes also in more solitary scattered pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996). After breeding the species is gregarious, with groups of 10-20 individuals common at feeding or resting sites, and flocks of hundreds or even thousands congregating briefly at favourable sites or during bad weather (Snow and Perrins 1998). Large groups (thousands of individuals) may also gather on German lakes and wetlands to moult before migrating to wintering areas (Olsen and Larsson 2003). Habitat Breeding The species breeds inland on shallow freshwater and brackish lakes, river basins, marshes and bogs, occasionally also at coastal lagoons, showing a preference for habitats with lush vegetation and emergent or floating plants in muddy shallow water (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Olsen and Larsson 2003). Non-breeding On migration the species occurs at sea, along shores, and on reservoirs, lagoons and lakes (Olsen and Larsson 2003), wintering along the coast on sandy and muddy beaches, mouths of rivers and at sea, especially at stream and sewage outlets (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Olsen and Larsson 2003).Diet Breeding The species is mainly insectivorous when breeding, taking e.g. dragonflies, beetles, midges, mayflies and stoneflies (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding On migration its diet is the same as during the breeding season (consisting mainly of insects) (del Hoyo et al. 1996), although during the winter the species switches to a diet of small fish and marine invertebrates (Urban et al.1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest varies from a shallow depression to a much more substantial structure depending on the situation (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Nests are sited on the ground in wet vegetation adjacent to or on shallow water, floating at the edge of emergent vegetation (e.g. in reedbeds), on grassy islands in freshwater shallow lakes, and occasionally also on sandbanks (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Olsen and Larsson 2003). The species breeds in colonies or subcolonies with nests spaced c.1-1.5 m apart, sometimes also in more solitary scattered pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","The species is vulnerable to oil spills (Mendel et al. 2008) and other types of marine pollution, including agricultural run-off (pesticides, biocides) (Ellermaa and Linden 2011).

A number of factors are likely to be contributing to declines, including climate change, pollution and increasing human intrusion or hunting within breeding areas. It is currently considered Near Threatened; but further surveys are required in order to clarify the true magnitude of declines.","Behaviour The species is migratory (Olsen and Larsson 2003). It breeds between late June and August (although most pairs do not lay until early-July). Most of the colonies in Canada, Greenland and Svalbard hold between 1-100 pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Gavrilo et al. 2007, Volkov de Korte 2000). Breeding numbers in the same colony in any given season is a subject of great inter-annual fluctuations (up to 10 fold) depending on ice conditions (food availability) during the pre-breeding season (Gavrilo 2011a, Eamer et al. 2013). There is also inter annual alteration between different breeding sites (Bangjord et al. 1994, Mallory 2005, Robertson et al. 2007, MacDonald, 1976, Volokov and De Korte, 1996, 2000, Gavrilo 2011a, Spencer et al. 2012). It departs from the breeding grounds during August - first half of October, returning late-February to early-June (Malory et al. 2008, Olsen and Larsson 2003, Volkov and De Korte 2000, Gilg et al. 2010, Spencer et al. 2014). Most active migration occurs in November, with the first birds only arriving on the wintering grounds in December (Bering Sea, southeast Greenland, Davis Strait/Labrador Sea), and with birds from Greenland, Svalbard, and Russia arriving in sequence (Gilg et al. 2010). Most of the birds wintering in the Pacific are thought to originate from the largest Russian colonies, Kara Sea Islands and Severnaya Zemlya (Gilg et al. 2010). Between July-December, they may travel 50,000 km on average, and even more for individuals that move to the Pacific (Gilg et al. 2010). Outside of the breeding season the species is weakly gregarious, occurring singly or in flocks of up to 20 individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998) or up to 2,000 individuals in favourable feeding places (Renaud and McLaren 1982, Lydersen et al. 2014). Larger numbers also gather in the spring at Hooded Seal Crystophora cristata whelping sites, where they feed on carrion and discarded placentae (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species also regularly follows Polar Bears Thalarctos maritimus to feed on scraps from their kill (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding It breeds on the high Arctic islands north of the July 5oC isotherm (Snow and Perrins 1998). Twelve different habitats are described for the species (Gavrilo 2011b) which are grouped into two principal categories: i) relatively inaccessible coastal or inland (up to 50 km from the coast [Wright and Matthews 1980, Gilg et al. 2009]) rocky mountains and cliffs up to 750 m high (Frisch and Morgan, 1979) and ii) a variety of flat-ground habitats including plain polar deserts, gravel and sandy spits, stony plateau, small gravel/bare islands (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Gavrilo 2011b), or even icebergs (MacDonald 1962, Macpherson 1962, Boertmann et al. 2010, Nachtsheim et al. 2016) or grounded ice floes (Kristoffersen 1926) as well as abandoned wooden buildings and other human artefacts (Gavrilo 2011b). In general, spatial-territorial patterns of Ivory Gull breeding colonies distribution are affected by the terrestrial predation, mostly by Arctic Foxes Vulpes lagopus (Gavrilo 2011b, 2012). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season it strongly associates with sea ice (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Gilg et al. 2010, Spencer et al. 2014) with preference for the marginal pack-ice zone. Gulls wintering in Davis Strait were found to persistently use ice areas with predictable and valuable food resources provided by remains of breeding and polar bear kills at the whelping patches of Hooded Seals (Spencer et al. 2016). The timing of formation and recession and extent of sea ice is suggested to play a large role in their distribution and migratory timing (Spencer et al. 2014). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and carrion (e.g. seal placentae) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Mallory et al. 2008, Karnovsky et al. 2009). The species is supposed to occupy upper trophic levels during the entire annual cycle, making it vulnerable to accumulation of toxic substances (Spencer et al. 2014). It feeds mostly by hovering and contact dipping in open leads in ice-filled waters or at the glacier fronts, walking along ice-floe edges and along the sandy beaches, or scavenging on marine mammal remains (Divoky 1976, Renaud and McLaren 1982, Mallory et al. 2008, Karnovsky et al. 2009, Lydersen et al. 2014, Gavrilo pers. comm.). Breeding site The nest is constructed of mosses and available vascular plants, straw and other debris on a snow-free area of broad rock ledges on steep, inaccessible coastal or inland cliffs up to 300 m high; on gravel, sand or clay ground; broken ice-fields and bare, level shorelines with low rocks; or on ledges, logs or roofs of abandoned buildings (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Gavrilo 2011a,b, Mallory et al. 2008, Volkov and de Korte 2000), avoiding areas with developed tundra vegetation (Gavrilo 2011b).","The loss of sea ice due to climate change represents a significant threat to the Ivory Gull as it is reliant on sea ice for breeding and hunting, selecting areas with 40-80% sea ice cover to forage. Decreasing sea ice has been linked to declines in Canada (Gilchrist and Mallory 2005) and changes to sea ice is decreasing the area of overlap with polar bears and seals, which they scavenge from, and is likely to lead to increased competition (Hamilton et al. 2017). Decreasing sea ice has been linked to declines in Canada (Gilchrist and Mallory 2005), as well as more generally across its range (Joiris 2017). Industrial diamond and gold mining in Canada (Bordeur Peninsula of Baffin Island, Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago) is likely causing habitat degradation and disturbance to breeding colonies (Gilchrist et al. 2008).This species feeds high up in the trophic chain and is therefore vulnerable to bioaccumulation (Braune et al. 2006). With pollution accumulating in Arctic waters from diffuse sources, the exact sources of pollutants are unknown. The species' reliance on seal and whale blubber makes it particularly vulnerable to heavy metal contamination (Tucker and Heath 1994, Spencer et al. 2014). Trace heavy metals have been recorded, such as silver, arsenic, cadmium and lead (Braune et al. 2006, 2007, Miljeteig et al. 2009, Lucia et al. 2015), as well as high levels of pesticides, including organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Lucia et al. 2016). The levels of OCPs, polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs and mercury in Ivory Gulls are among the highest ever reported in Arctic seabirds (Braune et al. 2006, Miljeteig et al. 2009, Lucia et al. 2015). Yet, this is not thought to be at high enough concentrations to cause direct mortality. There is a threat from synergistic and additive effects, which are likely to having a sub-lethal effect, shown in other bird species to affect parental behaviour, endocrine distribution and neurological functions, as well as potentially causing reproductive disruptions (Miljeteig et al. 2012, Lucia et al. 2016). Mercury levels are some of the highest reported in Arctic sea birds, and egg concentrations of industrial contaminants exceed published thresholds known to disrupt reproductive success of avian species (Lucia et al. 2015). The concentration of methyl mercury in feathers of Canadian birds increased by a factor of 45 during 1877-2007 (Bond et al. 2015). High levels of selenium may offer some protection against mercury concentrations, but could also damage gulls (Lucia et al. 2016). Chronic oil pollution is suspected. Although there are no records of oiled Ivory Gulls, they would not be expected to reach land or be recorded due to their ecology. Given impact on other, similar species at risk such as Little Auk Alle alle and Thick-billed Murre Uria Iomvia, Ivory Gulls are likely highly to be at risk (Gilchrist et al. 2008). The Ivory Gull has traditionally been hunted in Canada and Greenland and this is thought to have had an effect on their population (Stenhouse et al. 2004a). They have since become fully protected by law in Canada and Greenland (Stenhouse 2004) and, likely as a result of this, shooting is less common. Reports from Russia shows that hunting and egg collection seems to not have a major impact on the population (Gilchrist et al. 2008).","Using all data obtained recently and the current knowledge on Ivory’s gull biology in Russia, populations have been estimated at 1,000-1,500 breeding pairs on Franz-Josef Land (European Russia), 1,500-3,000 pairs on Severnaya Zemlya; and 1,000-2,500 pairs in the rest of the Kara Sea Islands (Central Asian Russia) (M. Gavrilo, unpubl. data). An estimated 1,000 pairs were recorded in northeast Canada (Hess 2004, Gilchrist and Mallory 2005, Mallory pers.comm. 2016), 900-2,000 pairs in Greenland between 2000 and 2012 and 800-1,500 pairs in Svalbard between 2001 and 2013 (BirdLife International 2015). Orr and Parsons (1982) recorded aerial estimates of possibly more than 35,000 individuals between Canada and Greenland in 1978-1979, while del Hoyo et al. (1996) estimated possibly 25,000 pairs (75,000 individuals). This gives a total of 58,100-77,200 individuals, rounded here to 58,000-78,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 38,000-52,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species has a circumpolar distribution in the Arctic seas and pack-ice during the non-breeding season, while its breeding range is confined to the Arctic Atlantic sector. It breeds from Canadian Arctic Archipelago (to Canada) through Greenland (to Denmark), Svalbard (Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands (to Norway), and islands of Franz-Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya and offshore islands in the Kara Sea (to Russia). In Russia, there are 55 known sites where Ivory Gulls have bred or have been breeding until now (Gavrilo 2009). During the past 25 years, 38 breeding sites have been confirmed, eight historical sites have been abandoned and 10 remain unsurveyed. Using all data obtained recently and the current knowledge on the species' biology, populations have been estimated at 1,000-1,500 breeding pairs on Franz-Josef Land (European Russia), 1,500-3,000 pairs on Severnaya Zemlya and 1,000-2,500 pairs in the rest of the Kara Sea Islands (Central Asian Russia) (M. Gavrilo, unpubl. data). During the last five years, the numbers of breeding pairs varied greatly between seasons and also inter-annually. For example, the colony on Sedov Archipelago (Severnaya Zemlya) had 2,000 breeding pairs in 2006-2007, but has held between 100 and 1,000 pairs in previous years. Also, the total numbers for five of the monitored colonies dropped from a maximum of 2,720 breeding pairs observed during 1990s-2000s to 450 pairs in 2016. Overall, no large-scale survey covering most of the key colonies during the same single season has been performed after 2006 and, thus, further research is needed to assess the overall Russian population estimate and trend. Other populations include 1,000 individuals in northeast Canada (Hess 2004, Gilchrist and Mallory 2005, Mallory pers.comm. 2016), 900-2,000 pairs (equating to 2,700-6,000 individuals) in Greenland (BirdLife International 2015), and 800-1,500 pairs (equating to 2,400-4,500 individuals) in Svalbard (BirdLife International 2015). Extrapolations based on aerial estimates suggested  &gt;35,000 individuals between Canada and Greenland in 1978-1979 (Orr and Parsons 1982). The global population is perhaps best placed in the band 58,000-78,000 individuals. Recent surveys have revealed a drastic decline in Canadian populations, falling from 2,400 birds in 1987 to 500-700 birds in 2002-2003 (Hess 2004), representing an 80% decline in that period across the Canadian breeding range in all three known nesting habitat types (Gilchrist and Mallory 2005). The species seems to be declining in the south of its Greenland breeding range, while in North Greenland the trends are unclear (Gilg et al. 2009). However, the overall population trend in Greenland is estimated to be decreasing (BirdLife International 2015).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Annex II. In Russia, it was listed in the Red Data Book of the U.S.S.R.

It is precautionarily listed as Vulnerable.","This species nests on remote oceanic islands in the Bering Sea. Nesting colonies occur on ledges of vertical sea cliffs up to 300 m high (Hickey and Craighead 1977). The species nests in dense aggregations often in the vicinity of other cliff nesting species, including the congeneric Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). It forages in surface waters within the top 0.5 m and feeds on small fish (e.g. lampfish, juvenile walleye pollock and other gadids), squid and marine invertebrates by pursuit diving (Byrd and Williams 1993). Birds arrive at nesting colonies in April and leave around September (Byrd and Williams 1993, Orben et al. 2015).","Being restricted to a range within 10 degrees of latitude, the species is vulnerable to the impacts of changing ice distribution and sea surface temperature. An investigation into the foraging habits of Red-legged Kittiwakes on St. George Island found that they fed almost exclusively on lipid-rich myctophid fish during the reproductive period (Kokubun et al. 2015), although there is evidence that they are also able to feed on neritic prey (Hunt et al. in Orben et al. 2014). Myctophid fish are not widely commercially fished and are protected by law in the West Coast Exclusive Economic Zone (Federal Register 2016), which includes some of of the Red-Legged Kittiwake’s non-breeding range. As a result of this, the Red-legged Kittiwake is likely to be less affected by fisheries than other piscivorous seabirds in its range during breeding and likely also during other parts of the year. This limited diet does, however, put them at great risk from changes in prey abundance and distribution due to the effects of climate change. Changes in distribution of prey fish has already been attributed to a lack of lipids in the diet of kittiwake, with experimental studies showing that a lipid-poor diet during development leads to higher levels of stress hormones (Kitaysky et al. 2001, 2006), growth retardation and impaired cognitive ability (Kitaysky et al. 2006). This is backed up by modelling indicating a link between warmer surface temperatures and lower productivity up to 2 years later, likely due to lower reproductive success of new breeders raised during the period of low food and worse winter survival rates of adults, which have had to increase foraging effort to provision young (Kitaysky et al. 2006). Later ice retreat dates are also related with lower productivity 2 years later (Zador et al. 2013), likely for similar reasons. However, the rate of the declines observed at the global level in the species is uncertain. In Alaska, the St. Paul populations remain badly depleted, while those on St. George have recovered to a large extent (Byrd et al. 2008). Although islands remain rat-free and a rat prevention programme is still in place, rats still pose a potential threat from boats arriving from mainland, rat-infested ports (Byrd and Williams 1993). Further human effects include subsistence offtake in Pribilofs, which could be causing decline; however, this is estimated under 250 birds collected annually on St Paul and St George (Byrd et al. 2008) described as 'trivial' and unlikely to affect the population.","The Pribilof Islands account for &gt;82% of the breeding population, with an estimated 235,624 breeding birds at St. George Island (per Goyert et al. 2017), 1,400 birds at St. Paul Island, and 172 at Otter Island (Thomson et al. 2014). The estimate for St. George is derived from a nest census conducted in 1995, while the estimates for St. Paul and Otter islands were taken from the most recent (2014) direct count of all attending birds conducted by the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The Commander Islands contain the only known Red-leggged Kittiwake colonies outside of the United States. These islands contain approximately 32,300 breeding birds (Vyatkin and Artyukhin 1994, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Artukhin 1999), which is approximately 14% of the breeding population. The colonies on Bering Island support by far the largest portion of the breeding birds of the Commander Islands, with an estimated 30,600 breeding birds in 1993 (Vyatkin and Artyukhin 1994). Recent counts for Bering Island and the other colonies in the Commander Islands group are not available. In the Aleutian Islands, Buldir Island (and its associated offshore rocks [Outer and Middle rocks]) is the largest colony with an estimated 8,605 breeding birds (per Goyert et al. 2017). Bogoslof Island and nearby Fire Island have a combined total of approximately 900 birds (Byrd et al. 2001). The remaining small colonies in the Aleutian Islands at Amak, Unalga, Koniuji and Chagulak islands contain fewer than 20 birds each (Byrd et al. 1997, 2004) and combined with Bogoslof Island account for &lt;1% of the population. Overall, the population size in Alaska has been estimated at 247,300 breeding adults (Goyert et al. 2017), along with the population size of 32,300 in the Commander Islands, Russia. This gives a global population size estimate of 279,600 mature individuals, placed here in the range 100,000-499,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Red-legged Kittiwake Rissa brevirostris occurs throughout the Bering Sea, and ranges across the North Pacific Ocean (including the Northern Gulf of Alaska) and the Sea of Okhotsk (USGS-ASC 2015). Vagrants have been noted along the Pacific Coast of Japan and along the West coast of the United States (Byrd and Williams 1993, Cole et al. 2006, Brazil 2009).Nearly the entire global population breeds in the Bering Sea, on the Pribilof (St. Paul, St. George and Otter), Bogoslof (Bogoslof and Fire) and Buldir (Buldir, Outer Rock, Middle Rock) islands, U.S.A., and the Commander Islands (Arij Kamen, Toporkov, Bering and Mednyi), Russia (Byrd and Williams 1993, Byrd et al. 1997). In addition, smaller colonies on Unalga, Koniuji, Amak, and Chagulak islands (Aleutians, U.S.A.) were discovered during the 1990s and early 2000s (Byrd et al. 2004, Gibson and Byrd 2007).Although their at-sea distribution is poorly studied, recent tracking efforts have shed new light into the at-sea habitat use of the species. Chick-rearing birds GPS-tracked from St. George Island forage to the southwest of the island in ocean waters (&gt;1,000 m), with occasional trips over the Bering Sea shelf (Kokubun et al. 2015). Geolocation-tracking from St. George Island has revealed that the majority of birds disperse after breeding to the northern Bering Sea (Orben et al. 2015). Hot spots of non-breeding distribution in the Bering Sea occur along the Russian coast in the Gulf of Anadyr and the Karaginsky Gulf (Orben et al. 2015). Birds also winter along the Kuril Islands in the Sea of Okhotsk, and in the western subarctic gyre (Orben et al. 2015, Orben et al. unpubl. data).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIt is a protected species in both the USA and Russia. All known Red-legged Kittiwake colonies in the U.S.A. are protected as part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. All colonies within the Commander Islands occur within the Commander Islands Nature and Biosphere Reserve. A rat prevention programme, conducted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in partnership with the Tribal Governments of St. Paul and St. George, is underway in the Pribilof Islands (Byrd and Williams 1993).

Characterise the diet of Red-legged Kittiwakes at multiple colonies. Investigate the link between ocean/climate conditions and the availability of forage species at the major colonies. Assess the efficacy of rat prevention measures at breeding colonies and develop and maintain infrastructure to respond to potential rat introductions (via shipwreck etc.) at remote breeding sites. Continue tracking studies and expand to additional colonies (e.g. Buldir, Bering, and Bogoslof islands) to characterize winter distribution and foraging distribution during the breeding season. Assess the impact of commercial fishing, and if warranted establish the proposed buffer zone around the Pribilof Islands in which trawl fishing would be prohibited (Lensink 1984).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Patagial tagging has been shown to cause a highly significant increase in nest desertation (Brubeck et al. 1981), likely to cause a loss of reproductive success through late-nesting birds experiencing lower hatching success due to predation (Mendillo 2009). Recreational activities have been shown to cause a significant increase in brooding terns flushing from the nest; however, this does not seem to cause a significant decrease in reproductive success (Mendillo 2009). The Least Tern is also vulnerable to habitat loss, having already lost large areas of habitat to flooding (Gochfeld et al. 2018), human alteration of waterflows (Farnsworth et al. 2017), and beach-side residential and tourism developments. It has shown itself to be flexible in terms of habitat use, moving to sandpits when sandbar habitat becomes available (Farnsworth et al. 2017).

One parent remains at the colony with the chick whilst the other is on a foraging trip. Birds departing colonies usually splash-down to form large rafts close to the colony before departing to foraging areas. External radio tagging has been shown to adversely effect breeding, whereas birds fitted with internal transmitters behaved as normal (Wanless et al. 1988, Nevins 2004). Diet During the breeding season, schooling pelagic fish species are the most important prey for adults, though benthic species can also be important. In Labrador, Canada, shannies (Sticheaidae) were the main source of food, comprising 84% of the diet in 1996 and 52.9% in 1997 (Bryant and Jones 1999). Capelin (Mallotus villosus) were also important, forming 44.7% of the diet in 1997 (Bryant and Jones 1999). In the UK, the main prey taxa are sandeel (Ammodytes spp.) and clupeids. Small gadoids are also important at some colonies. Foraging range This species dives to maximum depths of 170-230 m. During the breeding season, surveys recorded the highest densities of birds in the 51 - 100 m depth zone, although birds were still abundant in water less than 50 m and 101 - 200 m deep. Very few were seen in deeper areas (Wanless et al. 1990). The foraging range of this species appears variable across seasons and years. At the Isle of May, Scotland, during 1986 around 70% of foraging trips were over 7 km from the colony, whereas in the following year the birds tended to make shorter trips (Wanless et al. 1990). Foraging trips in eastern Canada are within 100 km (Cairns et al. 1987, Davoren et al. 2003), and in Pribilof Islands, Alaska, foraging occurred mostly within 60 km. In Witless Bay, Newfoundland, foraging aggregations formed over large Capelin schools within 5 km of breeding sites. Along the Newfoundland coastline, aggregations occurred within 15 km of the colonies, and at an offshore ridge about 80 km southeast of the colonies. Despite these large foraging radii, waters close to the colony were the most frequent destination of feeding birds. This was particularly true during chick rearing, when only one third of feeding trips could have exceeded 10 km from the colony (Cairns et al. 1987). In Pribilof Islands, Alaska, birds showed a consistent preference for shallower waters (Schneider and Hunt 1984). High densities of foraging birds have also been observed foraging over a submarine ridge (Coyle et al. 1992). In Kachemak Bay, Alaska, it appears that birds tend to feed over rocky substrates in water depths of about 18 to 55 m (Sanger 1987). They have also been observed to forage in riptides (Wanless et al. 1990), and in areas of sandy sediment suitable for sandeels (Wanless et al. 1998, BirdLife International 2000). Near Flamborough Head, UK, the Farallones, California, and Pribilof Islands, Alaska, birds forage at fronts between thermally distinct bodies of water. In the UK, this occurs at a seasonally-occuring front between thermally-mixed and thermally-stratified water, whereas in the Farallones, the front was between cold and salty upwellings and estuarine outflow (Decker and Hunt 1996, BirdLife International 2000).","This species is in direct competition with fisheries for food and, as such, overfishing of certain stocks appears to have direct impacts on Common Murres. The collapse of the Barents Sea capelin stock led to an 85% reduction in the breeding population on Bear Island with no signs of recovery (Nettleship et al. 2018). Mortality due to unregulated gill-net fisheries may also be significant (Nettleship et al. 2018). Oil pollution from vessels sunk during World War II is thought to be responsible for the sharp decline in Irish Sea colonies during the mid-20th century, from which the affected populations are yet to recover fully (Birkhead 2016). Hunting in the Faeroes, Greenland and Newfoundland is unregulated and may be occurring at unsustainable levels. No formal assessment has been made of sustainable harvest levels for this species (Nettleship et al. 2018). The Common Murre is also sensitive to variations in sea surface temperature, with a 1˚C change in temperature linked to an annual population decline of c.10% (Irons et al. 2008).","The global population is estimated to number &gt;18,000,000 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The European population is estimated at 2,350,000-3,060,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Increasing,"This species has a circumpolar distribution, occurring in the low-arctic and boreal waters of the North Atlantic and North Pacific (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayUria aalge ibericus is found on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive.

The impact of bycatch in fish nets can be reduced in several ways: Protecting areas on a seasonal and/or diurnal scale; concentrating salmon fisheries when salmon densities are high to improve fishing efficiency and catch to bycatch ratios; changing to an alternative fishing technique may reduce seabird mortality; and gear modification (Österblom et al. 2002).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Flatfish and gadoids are also sometimes important (Ewins 1990, Harris and Riddiford 1989). Amongst invertebrates, sea-scorpions are noted as an important prey item (Harris and Riddiford 1989). Adults tend to consume a higher proportion of invertebrates than chicks (Ewins 1990). In general, the importance of invertebrates increases with latitude (presumably reflecting overall availability) in the summer diet of both adults and chicks. The few data on winter food suggest that invertebrates are of greater importance during the winter than during the summer (Ewins 1990). Breeding site Both early spring and breeding distributions appear to be influenced by the Hell Gate and Cardigan Strait polynya located in western Jones Sound, Canada, between Ellesmere and Devon islands. The evidence presented suggests that annual variation in the distribution of ice edges in Jones Sound may influence the distribution of breeding birds among suitable breeding habitat. The observed distribution of Black Guillemots in March, April, and May is coincident with the location of open water and the associated ice edges. Thereafter, as the ice margin recedes and shoreleads open, the distribution of guillemots tends to reflect the location of breeding colonies (Prach and Smith 1992). Foraging range Birds feeding in the eastern Canadian Arctic fed principally in waters 10-130 m deep (Cairns 1987). Birds have been caught in nets up to 50 m deep, but have a theoretical maximum dive of 130 m. They have been observed actively feeding in water 35-45 m deep (Uspenski 1956). However, in Kattegatt, Denmark, approximately 80% of all Black Guillemots were recorded in water with depths of 10-30 m (Durinck et al. 1994). Black Guillemots were always recorded less than 5 km from the coast of Caithness, Scotland, during May-July (BirdLife International 2000). At the Bay of Fundy, Canada, almost all birds remained within 300 m of the shore (Ronconi and St. Clair 2002). At Papa Westray, Scotland, the mean foraging distance was 2.4 km away from the colony, and birds were recorded foraging in areas up to 3.9 km away from the colony, but despite this large variation in foraging range, feeding sites were never located further than 1.5 km from the shore (BirdLife International 2000). At Rockabill, Ireland, birds forage within 1 km of the colony or else fly 7 km or more to reach the mainland coast (BirdLife International 2000). In the eastern Canadian Arctic, censuses indicated that most birds were feeding within 13 km of breeding colonies, with a few found as far as 15 km (BirdLife International 2000). Sightings were frequently highest within 5 km of the colony (BirdLife International 2000). Several studies (at the Bay of Fundy, Finland, Denmark and Iceland) found that Black Guillemots foraged between 0.5 and 4 km from nest sites, and occasionally beyond 7 km away (BirdLife International 2000). By contrast, in the NW Territories, Canada, breeding adults rarely foraged close to the colony, and some birds may have been travelling as far as 55 km (BirdLife International 2000). Birds probably capture some prey in the water column, but forage principally on benthic prey (Cairns 1987). In Shetland, birds tend to forage where the sea bed is rocky and vegetated with dense stands of kelp Laminaria spp. (Ewins 1990) which reflects the habitat preferences of their main prey (BirdLife International 2000).","The following information refers to the species's European range only: This species is likely to be susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as sea temperature rise and shifts in prey distribution and abundance. The species is vulnerable to oil spills and other marine pollutants, including heavy metals, pesticides, PCBs and other crude oil-residues (HELCOM 2013). At the breeding colonies, the species is vulnerable to invasive predators, such as rats Rattus spp. and American Mink Neovison vison (HELCOM 2013). Bycatch in commercial fisheries is thought to have potentially severe impacts on the species in parts of the range (Nettleship et al. 2018), with birds susceptible to capture in gillnets in particular (Fangel et al. 2011, Žydelis et al. 2013), although other fishing equipment may also trap significant numbers. Increasing numbers of offshore wind farms may result in displacement from habitat, and a low risk of collision (Bradbury et al. 2014). The species is hunted for consumption in parts of Scandinavia (Mendel et al. 2008).","The European population alone was recently estimated at 304,000-742,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Europe forms c.50-74% of the global range; thus, a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 410,000-1,484,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. The population is therefore roughly placed in the band 400,000-1,499,999 mature individuals.",Unknown,"This species can be found throughout Arctic waters on the northern coasts of Russia, Alaska (U.S.A.), Canada and Norway, in the Atlantic Ocean off Greenland (to Denmark), eastern Canada as far south as the United Kingdom including the North and Baltic Sea (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe following information refers to the species's European range only: The species is listed within the African Eurasian Waterbird Agreement.

Its diet includes a wide variety of small benthic fish and invertebrates, widening to include more species in the summer. Chicks are usually fed fish which tend to be obtained within 1 km of the colony. It normally arrives at colonies between March and April, breeding on sea cliffs and slopes close to regions of shallow water usually less than 50 m deep. It is a monogamous species with high mate and site fidelity, usually breeding in small colonies of under 50 birds, sometimes as single pairs, but colonies of over 1000 birds have been seen. Individuals normally remain near colonies outside the breeding season, though birds from Alaska and California move south and north respectively (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","Certain colonies are vulnerable to oil spills and non-native predators (e.g. foxes), but the species's widespread distribution is thought to offset localised threats. Local declines have been recorded in colonies along the west coast of the U.S.A. (California, Oregon), attributed to oil pollution, human disturbance and warm-water years, while the steady decline in the Prince William Sound colony since 1972 is largely unaccounted for, though probably accentuated by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. Incidental capture in inshore gill-net fisheries is another cause of mortality, but likely only affecting colonies on a local scale (Nettleship et al. 2018).","The global population was estimated to number 235,000 individuals in 1993 (del Hoyo et al. 1996).",Stable,"The Pigeon Guillemot can be found in the North Pacific, breeding from the Kuril Islands (Russia), on the Kamchatka Peninsula to the eastern tip of Siberia (Russia), and from the western tip of Alaska (U.S.A.) down through the Atlantic coast of Canada to southern California (U.S.A.) and northern Mexico, including colonies on the Commander and Aleutian Islands (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is now listed as Near Threatened because it is nevertheless suspected to be undergoing a moderately rapid decline. Further studies are required to quantify the overall rate of decline and identify the most significant threats to the species.,"It lays a single egg on the ground amongst unvegetated scree or on cliff faces, but one recently found nest on Kodiak Island, Alaska, was on exposed bedrock (Stenhouse et al. 2008). Breeding was thought to be restricted to sites at or near the tops of mountains in glaciated regions (Day et al. 1999), but twelve active nests were recently found on Agattu in the western Aleutians, indicating that the species can nest at high densities in areas far from glaciers (Stenhouse et al. 2008). Individuals do not breed until 2-4 years of age, and may not breed every year (Day and Nigro 2004). It generally forages in different water types to the closely related Marbled Murrelet B. marmoratus, preferring but not exclusively feeding during the breeding season in turbid waters of glacial origin (Day et al. 2003). It feeds on fish and macro-zooplankton. During winter, recent work suggests that small groups are present in the Bering and Chukchi Sea in spring and autumn, but not in summer. Birds are almost always found in open leads of pack ice during early spring, but not in other times of the year, and birds are often found near Point Barrow in the autumn (M. Kissling in litt. 2010).","Strong links have been demonstrated between the population decline in the late 20th century and areas of glacial recession, possibly as a result of climate change (Piatt et al. undated, Kuletz et al. 2003, van Pelt 2005). The species’s strong association with glaciated or recently deglaciated habitats, and its highly aggregated distribution at sea, suggest vulnerability to large-scale changes to nesting and foraging habitats induced by global warming (Piatt et al. 1990, Kuletz et al. 2003, Piatt et al. 2011). Bycatch represents another threat, with considerable mortality documented in gill-net fisheries in Prince William Sound, Yakutat Bay, and near Kodiak Island (M. Kissling in litt. 2010). Additional risks posed by commercial fisheries include the crash of Pacific herring Clupea pallasii stocks after 1993 and possible competition between juvenile herring and hatchery-reared salmon in Port William Sound (Pearson et al. 1999, Kuletz et al. 2011). Climate change and large-scale harvesting at sea may act in synergy to change the abundance and distribution of vital prey species (Kuletz et al. 2006). 7-15% of the Prince William Sound population died as result of the Exxon Valdez (1989) oil spill, and it was suggested that, relative to its small population, the Kittlitz’s Murrelet was the most affected species of marine bird in this event (van Vliet and McAllister 1994). The species did generally not respond well to rehabilitation efforts, and Wood and Heaphy (1991) concluded that Murrelets have a low tolerance for capture and rehabilitation. Necropsies of oiled individuals revealed enlarged adrenal glands, indicating stress-induced mortality (Carter and Kuletz 1995). In 2008, the U.S. Government auctioned leases to drill for oil and gas in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska, raising the potential prospect of catastrophic oil spills in an area where the species is known to breed (BirdLife International 2008). Boat traffic in Glacier Bay was found to cause a 30-fold increase in flight behaviour and a 3-fold increase in diving effort, possibly translating into reduced foraging success and net energy loss. Nearshore densities of Murrelets were temporarily suppressed by vessel passage, but disturbance by traffic was not found to result in a persistent loss of foraging habitat (Agness et al. 2008). On Kodiak island, predation by Red Fox Vulpes vulpes was the major cause of nest failures over the 2008-2014 study period, with 92% of identified predators being Red Fox (n=22) (Knudson et al. 2014). Birds breeding in the western Aleutians have been found to have low reproductive success, with losses during the incubation period primarily due to avian predators locating unattended eggs, and chick mortality during the nestling period largely due to inclement weather (Kaler et al. 2008). According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, data from Agattu and Kodiak islands indicate that nest success has been very low (less than 10%), with few juvenile birds having been documented there, and blood chemistry analysis at Icy Bay indicates that few females there (c.10%) are breeding despite the majority (c. 90%) being in physiological breeding condition (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011). It is also suspected that adult mortality is slightly elevated by losses to hydrocarbon contamination, entanglement in gillnets and high predation pressure (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011).","The total population was recently estimated at 30,900-56,800 individuals (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010), but when factoring in the potential proportion of birds not counted in surveys, the total population may number c.48,000-82,000 individuals (M. Kirchhoff in litt. 2014). This is assumed to equate to c.32,000-55,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Brachyramphus brevirostris has a distribution that is geographically centred on the Bering Sea, where it is rare and patchily distributed in both Russia and the USA. In Alaska (where it has been estimated that c.70% of the total population occurs [K. Kuletz in litt. 2002]) it is found from just east of Cape Lisburne south to the Aleutian Islands and east to LeConte Bay. In Russia, it is limited to the eastern Chukotskiy Peninsula in the Chukchi Sea west to Cape Schmidt and south to Anadyr Gulf, as well as Shelikov Bay in the northern Sea of Okhotsk (Day et al. 1999). The global population has been estimated at 30,900-56,800 individuals (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010), but when factoring in the potential proportion of birds not counted in surveys, the total population may number c.48,000-82,000 individuals (M. Kirchhoff in litt. 2014).It had been thought that the species may be undergoing an extremely rapid decline, but recent work appears to have contradicted this. Surveys in much of the Alaskan range indicate that populations may have declined by 80-90% in the c.15 years since the early 1990s (Piatt et al. undated). In Prince William Sound, the population potentially declined by 84% between 1989 (6,436 birds) and 2000 (1,033 birds) following a possible longer-term decline since 1972 when the population was estimated at 63,000 individuals (K. Kuletz in litt. 2002, Kuletz et al. 2003). The rate of decline in Prince William Sound between 1989 and 2004 has been estimated at 63% (5% per year) (Kuletz et al. 2011b). In the Malaspina Forelands, numbers potentially declined by 38-75% between 1992 and 2002. Total abundance in Icy Bay, Alaska, was estimated to be 1,725-2,372 birds in 2002, suggesting a decline of 59% over a three-year period (Kissling et al. 2006). Some more recently published studies also report local declines in this species. An analysis of survey data from the Kenai Fjords, Alaska, suggests that a 90% decline occurred between 1989 and 2002; however, this analysis is hampered by changing survey methods over time, few years of survey effort and low population numbers (Arimitsu et al. 2011). In the Lower Cook Inlet, survey data suggest that the breeding population declined by 84% (26% per year) between 1993 and 1999 (Kuletz et al. 2011a). Anecdotally, the apparent recent absence of the species from LeConte Bay may indicate a change in its range in south-eastern Alaska, where the species’s abundance and distribution appears to be influenced by changes in icefields, raising concerns over its future in the region (Kissling et al. 2011). In Glacier Bay, density estimates declined by 89.1% between 1991 and 2000, with c.2,200 birds estimated there in 1999-2000 (K. Kuletz in litt. 2002). Subsequent surveys and analysis suggest a decline of 85-90% between 1991 and 2008, with an annual trend of between -10.7% and -14.4% (Piatt et al. 2011). However, Kirchhoff et al. (2010) recorded an increase in the on-water density of the species in Glacier Bay between 1993 and 2009, from 2.07 birds/km2 to 3.55 birds/km2, although this change is not significant. This apparent stability in the population suggests that any decline had occurred before 1993, most likely in the winter of 1991-1992 (Kirchhoff et al. 2010). Similarly, Hoekman et al. (2011b) recorded an apparent increase in abundance from numbers recorded in 1999-2007 compared with numbers in 2009-2010, although earlier surveys could have suffered from negative biases. The 1993 survey was replicated in 2009 and 2010, indicating no significant change in numbers (Kirchhoff et al. 2014). Overall, however, the various studies conducted in Glacier Bay are unlikely to be comparable owing to differences in survey methods and coverage (Kirchhoff et al. 2010, Hoekman et al. 2011b). In contrast to previous analyses, surveys of Prince William Sound in 2009 showed an apparent increase on numbers in 2001 (Allyn 2012).Many of the studies reporting declines during the 1980s and 1990s have been criticised, and Day et al. (2011) assert that there is a lack of strong evidence for a significant population change in the breeding and non-breeding populations in northern Alaska between 1970-1999 and 2000-2009, although they do not provide an alternative numerical analysis. Anecdotal evidence implies that numbers have been stable around Attu Island over recent decades (Madison et al. 2011). Increases have been recorded in other areas, such as Unalaska and Atka islands (Romano et al. 2005a,b, in Day 2011). Although Day (2011) criticises many of the analyses that have indicated very rapid declines in this species, he indicates that smaller declines in parts of or the whole of its range may still have taken place, and that shifts in the species’s geographic preferences could also account for local trends. Variation in numbers counted during localised surveys are likely to result from movements of birds over a range of temporal scales (e.g. Kirchhoff et al. 2010), and local abundance estimates may also be affected by anomalous oceanographic conditions (Arimitsu et al. 2010).Overall, survey data indicate that declines have leveled off in recent years (J. Piatt in litt. 2012), and data collected since 1998 show mixed trend results for several study areas, with no evidence of a steep overall decline in recent years (M. Kirchhoff in litt. 2014).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation and research actions underwayThis species is listed in the Russia Red Data Book (Van Pelt 2005, M. Kissling in litt. 2010).

Guidelines have been drawn up in the USA to avoid disturbance of nesting birds. From 2005 to 2009 in Icy Bay, Alaska, 340 birds were banded, and 122 adults and four juveniles have been radio-tracked leading to the discovery of eight nests (M. Kissling unpublished data).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Habitat This species if found offshore and along rocky sea coasts. It breeds on islands with dense vegetation. It forages mainly in offshore waters to the edge of the continental shelf, but may also be found inshore, where oceanographic processes concentrated food near the sea surface. It winters well offshore, often off the shelf break, but also over inshore waters, where food concentration is high. Its distribution is determined largely by concentrations of planktonic crustaceans and small fish. Diet Its diet is comprised mainly of planktonic crustaceans and small larval fish, with the specific prey species varying both geographically and temporally. Feeding usually occurs in small flocks by diving. Breeding Individuals arrive in the vicinity of colonies a month before laying, from early spring to mid-summer depending on the locality. It is colonial, but occurs at low densities, and is often associated with other alcids. It is nocturnal at colonies, nesting in burrows excavated in soil, but also in rock crevices and cavities and occasionally in holes dug by other subterranean nesters (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","Climate change probably poses the greatest threat to the species. The 1997–1998 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event had a strong effect on breeding success, reducing the number of chicks per pair from more than 1.4 to below 1, mostly caused by desertions before incubation began. Gaston and Smith (2001) found a positive correlation between May sea surface temperature (SST) and the slope of the regression of chick mass at colony departure on a particular date for a given year. Climate change is thought to be driving declines or fluctuations, yet further changes in SST and more frequent ENSO patterns in the future could accentuate the risk to the species. Invasive species are present in parts of the range, exerting negative impacts on local populations through predation. Breeding populations have been declining on both islands where rats Rattus spp. are present; the Lyell Island population declined by 22% over a 10-year period, and the one on Kunghit Island declined by more than 50% over seven years and appeared to be completely extirpated by 2004. Estimates of breeding populations in three rat-free colonies suggest stable or increasing numbers over 18- and 11-year periods (Regehr et al. 2007). The suggestion that racoons Procyon lotor have been responsible for many seabird losses over the last decades is supported by changes in predation levels recorded between years and corresponding seabird population trends. Predation levels were similar in 1990 and 1991, in the presence of raccoons, but declined by 80% in 1992, following the removal of three raccoons. Raccoon predation represents a conservation threat of international significance, because the Queen Charlotte Islands contain the majority of the world's Ancient Murrelet population, as well as substantial populations of several other burrow-nesting species that are also susceptible to raccoon predation (Hartman et al. 1997).","The global population is estimated to number c.1,000,000-2,000,000 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996). National population estimates include: c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in China; c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in Korea; c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in Japan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"The Ancient Murrelet can be found from the Yellow Sea (islands off China and Korea), through the Russian Pacific coast and the Aleutian Islands to the Haida Gwaii archipelago of British Columbia (Canada), where about half of the world population breeds.

Extrapolated over three generation lengths and allowing for uncertainty, the population is thought to be declining at a rate sufficient to be listed as Vulnerable. Should population trends become less uncertain both within and outside its European range it may merit uplisting or downlisting.","The species is exclusively marine, found on rocky coasts and offshore islands (Nettleship et al. 2014). It nests on grassy maritime slopes, sea cliffs and rocky slopes. During the winter it is wide-ranging, found in offshore and pelagic habitats.The species is a pursuit-diver, catching most of its prey within 30 m of the water surface but capable of diving to 60 m (Piatt and Nettleship 1985, Burger and Simpson 1986). They prey on 'forage' species, including juvenile pelagic fishes, such as herring Clupea harengus, juvenile and adult capelin Mallotus villosus, and sandeel Ammodytes spp. (Barrett et al. 1987). At times, they also prey on juvenile demersal fishes, such as gadids; planktonic crustaceans; and polychaete worms (Harris and Hislop 1978, Barrett et al. 1987, Martin 1989, Rodway and Montevecchi 1996, Harris et al. 2015). In the southern and eastern parts of its range, sandeels usually form the majority of the prey fed to chicks (Corkhill 1973, Hislop and Harris 1985, Harris and Wanless 1986, Martin 1989, Harris and Riddiford 1989). However, there are exceptions, such as at Skomer Island in 1969 when sprat made up the majority of the diet fed to chicks (Corkhill 1973), and in the Lofoten islands, where first-year herring are often the commonest food of chicks (Anker-Nilssen and Aarvak 2006).When feeding chicks, birds generally forage within 10 km of their colony, but may range as far as 50 to 100 km or more (Harris 1984, Anker-Nilssen and Lorentsen 1990, Rodway and Montevecchi 1996). A boat transect run on one day in 1970 found that 85% of all birds seen were concentrated within just 3 km of the colony (BirdLife International 2000), but other studies have found peaks in the density of foraging birds at up to 40 km distance from the colony (Webb et al. 1985, Stone et al. 1992, Stone et al. 1993, BirdLife International 2000). Similarly, surveys and GPS tracking at the Isle of May, Scotland, suggest that birds forage close to the breeding colony, but also at other sites up to 40 km away (Wanless et al. 1990, BirdLife International 2000, Harris et al. 2012). Various studies (Pearson 1968, Corkhill 1973, Bradstreet and Brown 1985, BirdLife International 2000), based on different breeding colonies, have estimated the theoretical maximum foraging radius at anywhere from 32 km (Corkhill 1973) to 200 km (Bradstreet and Brown 1985).","This species is highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change, such as increased sea surface temperature (SST) and associated shifts in prey (e.g. Herring, Sandeel) distribution, abundance and quality (Durant et al. 2003, Sandvik et al. 2005). Breeding failures are usually assumed to be due to food shortages (e.g. Martin 1989, Anker-Nilssen and Aarvak 2006, Harris and Wanless 2011, Anker-Nilssen et al. 2016), as changing temperatures can cause mismatches between plankton blooms, prey abundance peaks and Puffin breeding seasons, leading to poor chick growth, shortened nesting periods and lower fledging success (Durant et al. 2006). Sandvik et al. (2005) demonstrated decreased survival in North Atlantic seabirds (including the puffin) with increasing SST. There are several recorded examples of food stock collapse and its detrimental consequences for Puffins; The Sandeel population collapse near Shetland in 1985-1990 led to successive years of breeding failures (Mitchell et al. 2004), and another Sandeel crash in South and West Iceland and the Faroes in 2003-2005 led to food scarcity and collapse of Puffin populations with some colonies having 0% breeding success (Hansen and Sigurdsson in litt. 2016). Extreme weather and storms can cause mass mortality of seabirds, with large wrecks recorded following severe winter storms at sea, and represents a potentially growing threat due to the predicted increase in the frequency of extreme weather events (Melillo et al. 2014). In Pop Witless Bay, extreme cold and wet weather in 2011 caused the death of thousands of chicks across Witless Bay Reserve (Wilhelm et al. 2015). A severe wreck in March 2016 also delayed breeding on Isle of May (Newell 2016). The 2002 Norway wreck could have caused the death of as many as 100,000 birds, diagnosed as prolonged exposure to adverse feeding conditions at sea (but may also have been caused by disease or climatic factors affecting prey abundance) (Anker-Nilssen et al. 2013). A large wreck occurred in March 2013 along the coast of Scotland/northeastern UK, also coinciding with periods of extreme weather (3,055 and 1,364 birds collected on Scottish and English coast, respectively), where the majority died of starvation, likely due to difficulty feeding at sea (Harris and Elkins 2013). Productivity fell to 0.46 in the Farne islands in 2015 due to flooding caused by two major storms that destroyed nests with chicks (Wildlife review 2015). More such examples have been recorded throughout the species’ range. The threat of climate change to food stocks is exacerbated by the unsustainable harvesting of prey species by commercial fisheries, causing further reductions in food availability and subsequent low breeding success (Breton and Diamond 2014). Major fisheries have been noted as contributing to the collapse of key prey fish species since the 1960s and been linked to reproductive failure at colonies such as Røst, Norway (reduced recruitment due to food shortage in breeding season is considered the most likely cause of decline during 1986-2012) (Tasker et al. 2000, Anker-Nilssen et al. 2003, Miles et al. 2015). In addition to overharvesting of prey stocks, commercial fisheries are a cause of direct mortality. The Atlantic Puffin’s foraging strategy (diving) makes the species susceptible to being caught in gillnets and other fishing gear, but bycatch has not been recorded in significantly large numbers (Tasker et al. 2000, Rogan and Mackey 2007) and likely has a “trivial effect” on Puffin populations (Harris and Wanless 2011). At the breeding colonies, the species is vulnerable to invasive predators. American Mink Neovison vison is known to take puffins from burrows, and the escape of mink from fur farms in Iceland in the early 1930s drove many colonies to extinction in the following decades (Harris and Wanless 2011). Mink are still causing low rates of chick survival in parts of the range, including Hornøya, Norway (Barrett 2015). Rats Rattus spp. depredate eggs and chicks and have been linked to drastic colony declines and local extinctions in Sweden (Harris and Wanless 2011), on the Faroe Islands (Stempniewicz and Jensen 2007), Lundy Island (Lock 2006), Shiant Islands (Lockley 1953), and Ailsa Craig and Puffin Islands (Mitchell et al. 2004) (see also TemaNord 2010). Recolonisation and population recovery can be seen after rat eradication (Lock 2006). Hunting of puffins, mostly for human consumption, is allowed on the Faeroe Islands and Iceland (Thorup et al. 2014), yet uncontrolled harvesting in nesting grounds may lead to local declines. Adult birds are taken during the nesting season, thus causing reduced reproductive success and significant adult mortality, in addition to the general effects of disturbance. 10,000 individuals were recorded to be taken annually in the Nólsoy colony (Faeroes) and 150,000 in Iceland. This is suspected to limit recovery of populations and may exceed recruitment rate on Iceland, while the Nólsoy population is considered stable only due to migration (Stempniewicz and Jensen 2007). The species is particularly vulnerable to disturbance when nesting, and human intrusion associated with other recreational activities (tourism, walks) may also impact the species. Nest desertions have been recorded (Nettleship et al. 2014), and at one study site a 40% decrease in breeding success was seen in a frequently visited area compared to the control site (Rodway et al. 1996). The species is also vulnerable to oil spills and other forms of marine pollution. Past oil spills have had severe impacts on affected puffin populations; the wreck of the Torrey Canyon in 1967 was linked to decline in puffin numbers at Sept-Iles (Brittany) and the wreck of the oil tanker Amoco Cadiz (1978) badly affected moulting puffins in the region, killing 1,391 confirmed puffins which coincided with a 44% reduction in the Sept-Iles population. The number of Puffins killed is likely an underestimate, as many will not be recovered or identified on beaches after wrecks (Harris and Wanless 2011). Oiled puffins are often unable to fly, accentuating the effects of reduced food supplies and extreme weather preventing feeding. However, other oil spills seem to have had less effect on Puffin populations; the Tricolor spill in 2003 (Netherlands) was not found to have been a major cause of a local puffin wreck (35% of birds were oiled, most after death) (Camphuysen 2003). Nonetheless, the greatest impact of oil spills is likely to be on long-term condition of adults and ecosystem degradation, imposing a further risk to the Atlantic Puffin’s food resources. Various incidences of other marine pollutants have been recorded in the species; in 1970 21% of carcasses found in Scotland, and 22% of those shot off the coast of Norway contained elastic threads and other plastic particles (nylon thread, plastic beads etc). Given that the same proportion of pollutants were measured in healthy and deceased Puffins on Isle of May, pollution is regarded unlikely to be the primary cause of death, but may still pose a risk by accumulating over time and accentuating other threats for individuals already compromised by low food availability, adverse climatic conditions or hunting. The highest proportion of pollutants were found in first year birds, which may be explained by higher mortality among young birds with higher loads and only the less polluted birds reaching adulthood (Harris and Wanless 2011). Increasing numbers of offshore windfarms could result in displacement, but the risk of collision is considered very low (Bradbury et al. 2014). However, a study into puffin vision suggests they may be vulnerable to collision with man-made objects related to underwater wind farms (Martin and Wanless 2015).","The European population is estimated to be 4,770,000-5,780,000 pairs, which equates to 9,550,000-11,600,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). The global population size is estimated at 12–14 million mature individuals (Harris and Wanless 2011; Berglund and Hentati-Sundberg 2014).",Decreasing,"The Atlantic Puffin can be found throughout the North Atlantic Ocean, from north-west Greenland (to Denmark) to the coastline of Newfoundland (Canada) and Maine (USA) in the west, and from north-west Russia down to the Canary Islands, Spain (in winter) in the east (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The population in Iceland and Norway, which together account for 80% of the European population, decreased markedly since the early 2000s (BirdLife International 2015). In much of Iceland breeding has generally failed every year since 2003, but in the north, at least, it has been borderline sustainable (G. A. Gudmundsson in litt. 2015, E. Hansen in litt. 2016, A. Petersen in litt. 2016). The largest Norwegian colony, Røst, has experienced sharp declines from almost 1.5 million breeding pairs in 1979 to only 289,000 pairs in 2015, and has produced virtually no chicks in the last 9 years (T. Anker-Nilssen in litt. 2015, Anker-Nilssen et al. 2016). Most other Norwegian colonies are much smaller, including that at Runde, which has also declined; however most colonies remain unmonitored (A. O. Folkestad in litt. 2015, T. Anker-Nilssen in litt. 2015, 2016). Numbers on the southern coast of the Barents Sea have increased such that declines in the total population in Norway are estimated at approximately 33% since the early 1980s (Fauchald et al. 2015). Populations in the Faroe Islands (Denmark) and Greenland are also reported to be decreasing (BirdLife International 2015).The population size was estimated to be increasing in the U.K. during 1969-2000, and populations in the North Sea are probably currently stable or increasing after a decline in the 2000s due to two very low overwinter survivals of adults (Harris and Wanless 2011, Harris et al. 2013). A reduction in the recruitment of juveniles into the breeding population is thought to be the most likely factor involved in a sharp decrease in the number of puffins at the Fair Isle (U.K.) breeding colony; from approximately 20,200 individuals in 1986 to 10,700 individuals in 2012 (Miles et al. 2015). Adult survival probability remained similar across the 27 years of the study, whilst breeding success, the number of feeding visits by adults to chicks and the size of available prey fish all decreased. Trends from North America are uncertain, with the population at Great Island, Witless Bay showing increases between 1979 and 1994, but it has potentially stabilised or is in decline now (Wilhelm et al. 2015). A restoration project off the coast of Maine has also had some success (D. Wege in litt. 2002, see http://projectpuffin.audubon.org/).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayThe species is listed under the African Eurasian Waterbird Agreement.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory and breeds from April or May to June or August (del Hoyo et al. 1992) in isolated solitary pairs (Fjeldsa 2004), sometimes also nesting in loose colonies (del Hoyo et al. 1992) of up to c.20 pairs (Snow and Perrins 1998). Post-breeding adults undergo a flightless wing-moulting period (Fjeldsa 2004) after which they migrate south either singly or in small loose flocks, with concentrations of over 2,000 individuals occurring at favoured staging sites (del Hoyo et al. 1992). During the winter the species typically feeds singly and rarely aggregates into flocks (Fjeldsa 2004). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on small (less than 3 ha), shallow (less than 2 m deep) inland waters with abundant emergent vegetation (e.g. reedbeds), and stretches of open water, showing a preference for waters in forested areas or in shrub tundra further to the north (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Fjeldsa 2004). Suitable habitats include small pools and lakes, backwaters of large rivers, pools cut off from the sea in estuaries (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and coastal lagoons (Fjeldsa 2004). In coastal locations the species often makes foraging flights to inland lakes or offshore areas, and if foraging at sea it shows a preference for sub-tidal locations down to a depth of 15 m with sand or gravel substrates, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed (Fjeldsa 2004). Non-breeding When moulting, on passage or during the winter the species frequents large inland lakes (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Fjeldsa 2004) or shallow coastal areas (Fjeldsa 2004) with abundant fish stocks (del Hoyo et al. 1992), often considerable distances from the shore, amongst islands in archipelagos or over drop-off zones (Fjeldsa 2004). When foraging at sea the species shows a preference for sub-tidal locations down to a depth of 15 m with sand or gravel substrates, scattered rocks and patches of seaweed (Fjeldsa 2004). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of invertebrates (Snow and Perrins 1998) such as adult and larval aquatic insects (e.g. water beetles, water bugs and dragonfly larvae), crayfish and molluscs (Konter 2001), although fish are also be important locally or seasonally (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is a floating platform of plant matter anchored to submerged or emergent vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species typically breeds in isolated pairs with more than 50 m between neighbouring nests (Fjeldsa 2004), although in some cases (e.g. on predator-free islands of floating vegetation attached to emergent vegetation beds) semi-colonial nesting may occur (Fjeldsa 2004).","The introduction of large fish, such as the non-native Rainbow Trout, to many inland waterbodies for freshwater fisheries and recreational fishing has resulted in greatly increased resource competition for invertebrate and smaller fish prey (HELCOM Red List 2013). The productivity and suitability of waterbodies used by the species is also thought to be impacted by the expansion of timber plantations throughout the boreal zone, however, the impacts of this are presently unknown. The species is also highly susceptible to bycatch in gillnets, with tens to hundreds caught annually in the Baltic Sea (Zydelis et al. 2013). This is considered likely to be the driver of a very rapid decline over the past few decades in the Baltic Sea (Skov et al. 2011) but represents only a small part of the global wintering range. Bycatch is also a threat in North American coastal waters. Red-necked Grebes were among the species most severely impacted by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, demonstrating little recovery in numbers within three years (Day et al. 1997). However, its very large range places only a small proportion at risk of direct mortality in a single incident. Persistent organochlorine pollution has been documented to reduce egg viability dramatically in the past, thus greatly reducing reproductive success (De Smet 1987), but bans on the use of such compounds has reduced the threat this poses to populations. Many freshwater sites throughout the breeding range have become eutrophied through the effects of agricultural run-off and large-scale freshwater fisheries, the impact of which is unknown. It is considered to be at relatively high risk of collision with wind turbines and other offshore infrastructure due to undertaking nocturnal flights and having only low manoeuvrability (Garthe and Hüppop 2004), although the effect of this on the population has not been quantified. The species has also been recognised as a species of high vulnerability to climate change in a full life-cycle assessment in America (Culp et al. 2017), but actual impacts presently unknown.","The global population is estimated to number c.190,000-290,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015), while national population estimates include: c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs, c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in China; &lt; c.100 breeding pairs, &lt; c.50 individuals on migration and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in Japan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009). The European population is estimated at 27,700-47,900 pairs, which equates to 55,400-95,800 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species can be found in western Canada, north-west U.S.A., eastern Russia, north-east China and northern Japan, wintering from Japan and Korea through the Aleutian Islands to California (both U.S.A.), and off eastern the U.S.A. south to Florida.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour The species is fully migratory, although the extent of migration varies between populations. Some populations, e.g. in Spain, remain predominantly sedentary (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Autumn movements are often protracted, with dispersal beginning in mid-August and lasting until late-November (peaking in October). The return migration begins in March (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species's migratory movements are mainly nocturnal, although diurnal migration is known in the Palearctic (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It breeds between May and June in the Northern Hemisphere (although laying dates often vary extensively between years and lakes), and nests in reed swamps in colonies of up to 2000 nests, although it may also nest in isolated pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Fjeldså 2004). It forages diurnally (Brown et al. 1982, Fjeldså 2004) and is highly gregarious, both on migration and during the winter, forming concentrations of hundreds of thousands at certain sites in North America and Asia (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Fjeldså 2004). After arrival at autumn staging grounds (e.g. Mono Lake in California) the species becomes flightless for 3 to 4 months due to loss of weight from the pectoral muscles (Ogilvie and Rose 2003). Habitat Breeding During the breeding season the species frequents permanent and temporary small, shallow, highly eutrophic pools with lush vegetation, such as freshwater marshes and lakes with dispersed submergent vegetation and patches of reeds, as well as ponds and fish ponds, sewage farms, quiet river backwaters and newly flooded areas (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Konter 2001, Fjeldså 2004). In southern Russia and Kazakhstan, it shows a preference for variably developed reed swamps and gypsotrophic lakes (alkaline waters with rich submergent vegetation such as Chara and Potamogeton pectinatus) (Fjeldså 2004). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species moves to salt lakes, hyper-saline industrial evaporation ponds and reservoirs, or to coastal estuaries, arms of the sea, and inshore shallows in bays and channels (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Fjeldså 2004). Diet The species is carnivorous, its diet consisting of adult and larval insects (such as aquatic bugs, terrestrial and aquatic beetles, damselflies, dragonflies, midges and brine-flies), molluscs, crustaceans (e.g. brine shrimps), amphibians (e.g. small frogs and tadpoles), nereid worms, snails and small fish (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Konter 2001, Fjeldså 2004). Breeding site It usually nests colonially in thinly spaced, emergent marsh vegetation (such as Scirpus, Typha or sedge Carex), or on dense mats of floating waterweed, sometimes far from the shore (Fjeldså 2004). The nest is a floating platform of aquatic vegetation anchored to emergent vegetation such as reeds (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Fjeldså 2004).","Sporadic episodes of catastrophic mortality in the Salton Sea, which have been as large as 150,000 individuals (around 6% of the North American population) in 1991-1992 (Meteyer et al. 2004), appear to be driven by both gradual and episodic reductions in the population of pileworms, the primary prey source available to grebes in the winter (Anderson et al. 2007). These reductions are likely due to an increase in salinity of the lake reducing overall pileworm productivity and increasing water column stratification. This results in the production of anoxic conditions with high sulphide levels in deeper water, subsequent weather-mediated mixing events bring this water to the surface, killing pileworms and resulting in the death of grebes too weak to move onto better wintering grounds by starvation (Anderson et al. 2007). Populations have also been known to crash in winter habitats during El Niño Southern Oscillation events due to reductions in food availability due to warming sea-surface temperatures, although they rebound to previous levels afterwards (Jehl et al. 2002).","The global population is estimated to number c.3,900,000-4,200,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 46,400-77,500 pairs, which equates to 92,800-155,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"This species is found on every continent except Australasia and Antarctica.

It also attends trawlers and will form large congregations where food is plentiful. Breeding is highly seasonal starting between March and April, usually in large colonies on cliffs and offshore islands, but also sometimes on the mainland. Young birds will migrate to the extreme south of its range, whereas adults range less extensively but still regularly winter in the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","Northern Gannets are consistently recorded as bycatch across fisheries in the Atlantic. It is the species most freqently killed as bycatch in fisheries assessed in Portuguese Atlantic waters, and captured at a relatively high rate in demersal longline operations, but also set-nets and purse-seines (Oliveira et al. 2015). Total estimates of numbers killed are lacking. In nearshore water off the east coast of the U.S., estimates of under 500 individuals per year suggest that population level impacts may be relatively small; however, this is derived from observers on less than 5% of fisheries within a small proportion of the range, and there is no cumulative assessment of impact (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011). Considering the observation of bycatch in fisheries across the range of the Northern Gannet (Smith and Morgan 2005, García-Barcelona et al. 2010, Oliviera et al. 2015) and evidence of increased breeding populations following the closure of Canadian gillnet fisheries (Regular et al. 2013), levels of bycatch are sufficient to cause significant declines in the species.

Individuals form colonies that are usually smaller than those of other Sula species (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","Brown Boobies are hunted for use as food and bait in some areas of their range (Carboneras et al. 2018); however, this is thought to have negligible effects on their population. They are also highly sensitive to human disturbance, with the presence of humans 10-20 m from the nest enough to cause the birds to leave (Borsa et al. 2010). Humans also indirectly affect the species; Verlis et al. (2014) found that most S. leucogaster nests surveyed contain at least one item of marine debris, with black and green items positively selected for as a nesting material. Further to this, Lavers et al. (2013) found that around 30% of the debris poses some entanglement risk to the birds. This is currently unlikely to represent a significant source of injury and mortality (Lavers et al. 2013), but is likely to increase due to the long term persistence of marine debris. In the past, organochemical pollution has caused a significant reduction in reproductive success due to the thinning of eggshells, often caused by DDT use in agricultural areas as well as, in one case, mosquito control for a tourist development. Currently, eggshell thickness varies in relation to individual characteristics and/or feeding sources, as opposed to actual exposure and, where records are available, eggshell thickness has recovered to pre-DDT conditions (Mellink et al. 2009). Introduced rats are also thought to impact on the species through reduction of reproductive success on invaded islands (Pitman et al. 2005. Carboneras et al. 2018).","The global population is estimated to number &gt;200,000 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1992).

The species breeds from May onwards in isolated solitary pairs, nesting later further to the north depending on the timing of the snow melt (del Hoyo et al 1992). Adults become flightless for a short time in late-winter when they moult their flight feathers (Godfrey 1979). During winter, the species occurs singly, in pairs or in small loose flocks in marine habitats, occasionally also forming large congregations of c.300 (Godfrey 1979, Snow and Perrins 1998, del Hoyo et al 1992). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on large, deep freshwater lakes in coniferous forest or on open tundra (del Hoyo et al 1992). For nesting, it requires clear water with a visibility of at least 3-4 m and small islands (less than 2.5 ha) (Rimmer 1992). Non-breeding It winters along the coast on exposed rocky shores, sheltered bays, channels and sheltered inlets,  preferring shallow inshore waters (del Hoyo et al 1992, Rimmer 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). It may also be found inland on lakes and reservoirs during this season, although this is largely influenced by the weather (del Hoyo et al 1992, Rimmer 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of fish as well as crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic insects, annelid worms, frogs, other amphibiansand plant matter (e.g. Potamogeton spp., willow Salix spp. shoots, roots, seeds, moss and algae) (del Hoyo et al 1992). Breeding site The nest is a mound of plant matter screened by vegetation and placed near the water's edge on islands, islets or promontories (del Hoyo et al 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998).","Relatively high levels of mortality from commercial gillnets have been recorded, e.g. in Chesapeake Bay, 21% of birds killed were this species (Forsell 1999) and bycatch appears relatively frequent in the great lakes, with up to 50 caught in a single net in a week (Evers et al. 2010). This indicates the potential for significant indiscriminate mortality, though this may be an extreme example and efforts to improve fishing gear to reduce this bycatch have been generally effective (Carey 1993). May also be vulnerable to human disturbance and pollution of inland breeding lakes.","Wetlands International (2016) estimated the population at 612,000-640,000 individuals. In Europe the breeding population is estimated at 700-1,300 pairs, which equates to 1,400-2,600 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Stable,"This species breeds in much of Canada and Alaska, parts of northern U.S.A., southern parts of Greenland (to Denmark) and in Iceland. It winters on coasts or on larger lakes over a much wider area including the Atlantic coast of Europe from Finland to Portugal and the western Mediterranean, the Atlantic coast of North America down to northern Mexico, and the Pacific coast of North America from northern Mexico to the tip of Alaska (U.S.A.)

However, accurate data are lacking and further surveys need to be conducted to quantify the current rate of harvest. Therefore, precautionarily, the species is listed as Near Threatened.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It breeds from early June (largely depending upon the timing of the spring thaw) in solitary pairs, after which it travels southwards and towards the coast to its wintering grounds, where it is present between October and May (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season the species occurs singly, in pairs or in small groups (Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding The species may breed on low-lying Arctic coasts and estuaries, but is more common on freshwater pools, lakes or rivers in the Arctic tundra, showing a preference for deep, clear lakes with stony or sandy substrates where water levels do not fluctuate (Flint et al. 1984, North and Ryan 1989, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Earnst et al. 2006). Optimum habitats include lakes where the water does not completely freeze, which have dependable supplies of fish and which have highly convoluted shorelines and aquatic vegetation providing habitats for fish and sites for nesting and brood rearing (Earnst et al. 2006). The species generally avoids forested areas, but may fly long distances to feed away from breeding waters (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season, the species inhabits inshore waters, fjords with muddy substrates and inlets along sheltered coasts, generally avoiding ice-covered waters (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Byrkjedal et al. 2000). Diet Its diet is little known, but may consist predominantly of fish (e.g. Coregonus and Pungitius species, cottidae, Microgadus proximus and Gadus morhua) as well as crustaceans, molluscs and marine annelids (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is a small depression in a mound of plant matter or turf constructed on dry land 1 m away from the edge of water, usually on the shores of lakes with deep, clear water and stony or sandy substrates in sites providing good visibility over the surrounding land and water (Flint et al. 1984, North and Ryan 1989, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Earnst et al. 2006).","The Yellow-billed Loon is harvested for subsistence in Alaska, and a record of c.1,000 individuals taken in the Bering Sea region in 2007 indicates that this may pose the greatest threat to the species (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009, M. Kirchhoff in litt. 2010). More recently, however, other approaches to quantify loon harvest have come up with figures of 5 birds annually in 2011 and 2012 (Naves and Zeller 2017). Although this species is vulnerable to oil spills, its very large range means it is unlikely that a large proportion of the global population will be affected by any single event. Mercury or other heavy metal contamination pose a potential threat, particularly for birds wintering on the Asian side of the Pacific where feather and egg mercury concentrations considerably above background levels have been recorded (Evers et al. 2014). There is some competition with fisheries for food, however, this only impacts a small percentage of the global population. Threats are exacerbated by a low reproductive rate and very specific breeding habitat requirements (K. Laing in litt. 2008, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009).","The global population has been estimated at 16,000-32,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"This species breeds in the Arctic in Russia, Alaska (U.S.A.) and Canada, and winters at sea mainly off the coasts of Norway (&gt;1,500 individuals [Bell and Håland 2008]), western North America, and the eastern coast of Asia, including the coasts of Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and China (del Hoyo et al. 1992, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2009).

It will also breed near human habitation, sometimes even on occupied houses along the seafront of towns. Its diet comprises of variable quantities of fish, squid and zooplankton (especially amphipods), and it will also feed on fish offal and carrion (e.g. whale blubber). Most of its food is obtained by surface seizing but it will also plunge (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Tracking at Bear Island (Norway) revealed breeders foraging close to the colony, preferring the continental shelf. As chicks became older, parents foraged further from the colony, eventually regularly embarking on long trips to the Norwegian coast (Weimerskirch et al. 2001).","In some breeding colonies, the species is susceptible to low level predation from invasive mammals such as rats Rattus spp., cats Felis catus and Red Fox Vulpes vulpes (Mendel et al. 2008). Bycatch in fisheries is also a significant threat, with large numbers recorded as caught in longline fisheries in the North East Atlantic and in trawl fisheries (Dunn et al. 2001, Anderson et al. 2011) as well as in gill-net fisheries (Žydelis et al. 2013). However, bycatch is not believed to be causing significant population decline. The species is susceptible to oil spills throughout North Sea with chronic pollution recorded in many individuals, yet with apparently minor impacts on reproductive rates. Plastic ingestion also represents a threat across much of the Northern Fulmar’s range, with around 95% of beached birds in the North Sea containing plastic, more than 40% in the eastern Canadian Arctic (van Franeker et al. 2011) and 87% in Svalbard (Trevail et al. 2015). The majority of these contained more than the 0.1g per individual deemed acceptable under the OSPAR agreement; however, there is evidence that relatively large loads of ingested plastic may be processed through a bird relatively rapidly (van Franeker et al. 2011). Plastic loads are higher in juvenile birds and there is some evidence that adults pass on plastic to chicks. The effect of plastic ingestion on the population is unknown. The species was subject to intensive exploitation for food in the past, and hunting continues in Alaska, Greenland, Iceland, Svalbard and the Faroe Islands (Thorup et al. 2014, Carboneras et al. 2016). However, this is not thought to have a significant impact on the population.","The global population is estimated at c.7,000,000 pairs or 20,000,000 individuals (Carboneras et al. 2016).

Although their burrows were once found on forested ridges on Raoul Island, all colonies on Macauley Island are under grass, sedges or fern (G. Taylor pers. comm. in Gaskin 2011). On Raoul, it nested below 300 m on high-altitude ridges (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Two birds were found on the northern terraces of the island (2005 and 2006) covered in the spiny burrs of a native grass (Cenchrus calyculatus) that prevented them from flying. These two birds were presumed prospecting birds and a return to breeding on this rugged island cannot be discounted. This species is also known (from at-sea observations) to be in the waters around Raoul Island in May (Gaskin 2011).  On Phillip Island, it is a summer breeder. Birds come ashore as early as 11 November, but lay eggs in January (Priddel et al. 2010). Birds nesting on Philip Island differ from the population on Macauley by nesting among boulders and in crevices in rocky habitat with sparse understorey, below a canopy of mature White Oaks Lagunaria patersonia that provide concealment from avian predators (Priddel et al. 2010). It has also been known to nest in artificial cavities. On Phillip Island, the only known nests are at the top of Long Valley, but other areas have potential nest sites (Priddel et al. 2010). It feeds mainly on squid (Heather and Robertson 1997). Little is known of the breeding biology.","The primary threat faced by this species is invasive mammals. Cats are likely to have been responsible, along with Brown Rat, for the extirpation of the species on Raoul Island. Both are still present on Vanua Lava and pose an existential threat to the species there. Rabbit overgrazing led to considerable erosion on Phillip Island, and their eradication appeared to enable White-necked Petrel to recolonise the island. Domestic Pigs contributed considerably to the degradation of Phillip Island and may have previously impacted the species on Norfolk Island. They are still present on Vanua Lava, and given the impact on other burrowing petrels in the region may be precautionarily assumed to be having a significant impact on this population. Goats dramatically altered the vegetation on Macauley Island prior to their eradication but no clear population impacts were recorded. Polynesian Rats are present in some parts of the range but have not been demonstrated to impact the population. People on Vanua Lava previously harvested chicks from burrows near Mount Suretamatai (Carboneras et al. 2018) however, this affected a minority of the population and is thought unlikely to return. A native fern, Hypolepis dicksonioides, has formed a monospecies stand across approximately 70% of Macauley Island following the removal of goats in 1970 and presumed successful rat eradication in the first decade of the 21st century (de Lange 2015). This is unsuitable for petrel nesting and may have excluded the species from a considerable area formerly used for breeding (G. Taylor in litt. 2016, de Lange 2015). However, it appears that Homolanthus woodland is invading this monoculture and with time much of this area will become suitable for nesting once again (de Lange 2015), although numbers breeding at present are likely to be considerably lower than were found in 1988 when the population was last estimated (G. Taylor in litt. 2016). The species is also potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: it is restricted to an island or islands with a maximum altitude of 238 m (BirdLife International unpubl. data).","The total population has been estimated at c.100,000 mature individuals (1988), roughly equivalent to 150,000 total individuals.",Increasing,"Pterodroma cervicalis breeds on Macauley Island in the Kermadec Islands, New Zealand (c.50,000 pairs in 1988), with a second small colony recently established on Phillip Island, off Norfolk Island (to Australia) with nests increasing from six in 1994 to 20 in 2005 (Priddel et al. 2010). It bred on Raoul Island, also in the Kermadec Islands, early in the 20th century (Taylor 2000). Two birds were found on Raoul Island in 2005 and 2006 covered in seed-burrs, possibly prospecting (Gaskin 2011).

Two birds found on Raoul Island covered in seed burrs in 2005 and 2006 were presumed prospecting birds. Since 2007, automated sound attraction units have been installed on Raoul Island in an attempt to lure the species. However, there has been no evidence so far that this has worked, although breeding on this rugged island cannot be discounted as searches in promising gully areas have not occurred (C. Gaskin in litt. 2016). A study area on Macauley was established in 1988 (G. Taylor in litt. 1999). The Kermadec Islands are nature reserves with access by permit only.

This key step in turning the fortunes of the species followed the earlier eradication of cats from Little Barrier Island in 1980, and Weka Gallirallus australis from Codfish Island in the early 1980s. The species is still restricted to a very small number of breeding locations, and if invasives should become established again on Little Barrier Island, extremely rapid population declines could ensue. Therefore, the species qualifies as Vulnerable.","It breeds in burrows on forested ridges and steep slopes at 300-700 m on Little Barrier and 4-350 m on Codfish; ideal breeding habitat is unmodified forest close to ridgetops with a low and open canopy and many large stems (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Rayner et al 2007a). It formerly bred in suitable habitat throughout New Zealand (Imber et al 2003). It feeds mainly on squid, crustaceans and small fish (Heather and Robertson 1997).","Those birds on Great Barrier Island are at risk from predation from multiple invasive species, with cats, Weka, and Polynesian and Black Rats present (Ogden and Gilbert 2009), however, only 20 pairs still nest on this island. The Weka is also known to have decreased the population on Codfish Island (Marchant and Higgins 1990).","M. Rayner (in litt. 2012) estimates over 650,000 mature individuals on Little Barrier in 2007 and c.15,000 mature individuals on the Cod fish Islands in 2008, thus the total population estimate is rounded to c.670,000 mature individuals.",Increasing,"Pterodroma cookii is endemic to New Zealand, where it breeds on Little Barrier, Great Barrier and Codfish Islands. Birds migrate to the eastern Pacific Ocean, mainly between 34°S and 30°N (Heather and Robertson 1997) although vagrants do wander as far north as the Gulf of Alaska and south of the Aleutians (Howell 2012). On Great Barrier, only 12 burrows have been found during the last 25 years; there may be fewer than 20 pairs (Imber et al. 2003) and it is extinct as a reproductively viable population, probably owing largely to the presence of rats Rattus spp. (M. Rayner in litt. 2012). On Codfish the population declined from c.20,000 pairs in the early 1900s almost to extinction before predators were removed in 1982; it is now increasing and was estimated at 5,000 breeding pairs in 2007 (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Heather and Robertson 1997, Imber et al 2003, Rayner et al. 2008), and in 2012 was thought to number c.5,000-6,000 breeding pairs (M. Rayner in litt. 2012). The population on Little Barrier is also likely to be increasing (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Taylor 2000), and modelling and spatial analysis has suggested that as many as 286,000 pairs may breed on the island annually (Rayner 2007b); six times the number previously suggested (Anon. 2007). Little Barrier/Hauturu Island supports 98% of the world population, with the remainder breeding on Codfish/Whenua Hau Island, off Stewart Island.In 2010, 50 chicks were translocated from Little Barrier to Hawke’s Bay peninsula, south of Cape Kidnappers (Fallwell 2010). The project aims to translocate 350 chicks to build up the colony, following the fencing of a 2.5 ha site against mice and other predators (Fallwell 2010). Behavioural, morphological and genetic analyses has produced evidence of a distinct population genetic structure (Rayner et al. 2010), and a recent study of year-round movements indicates two separate migration routes over historic timescales, with birds at Little Barrier migrating to the northern Pacific Ocean and birds at the Codfish Islands migrating to the Humboldt Current (Rayner et al. 2011). These data imply that the two populations may be best treated as different subspecies and represent separate management units (M. Rayner in litt. 2012).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCats were eradicated from Little Barrier by 1980, and Weka was eradicated from Codfish between 1980 and 1985 (Taylor 2000).

An eradication operation took place in 1998 on Codfish (D. V. Merton in litt. 1998). Translocation of chicks from Little Barrier to another potential nest site, Cape Sanctuary in Hawke’s Bay peninsula, is on-going (M. Rayner in litt. 2012). Chicks have been transferred at 50-60 days of age, 20 days before fledging, so that they have time to identify with their new location without needing prolonged feeding (Fallwell 2010).

Confirmation that introduced predators are causing a decline would result in an uplisting to Critically Endangered.","The species is highly pelagic and rarely approaches land, except at breeding colonies. It nests in burrows on slopes in Dicksonia externa fern-forest, stands of low fern and adjacent grasslands and along open ridges at elevations of 600-1,150 m (J. C. Torres-Mura in litt. 1999, Hodum 2009, Reyes-Arriagada et al. 2012). One egg is laid in mid-December to early January (Hodum 2009) and chicks hatch in February-March (Hodum and Wainstein 2003). It is dependent on subsurface predators, especially Yellowfin Tuna Thunnus albacares, to drive prey to the surface (Au and Pitman 1986, Ballance et al. 1997). ","Invasive mammals such as cats, rats, goats and dogs are thought to threaten this species. Feral cat Felis catus predation has been documented and is thought to be causing population decline, with a preliminary estimate of 2-3% annual adult mortality from cat predation (Hodum 2009). Additionally, feral cats prey on near-fledging chicks when they are on the surface exercising their flight muscles, although predation rates have not been quantified (Hodum 2009). Brown rats Rattus norvegicus also prey on chicks, though the incidence appears low and restricted to certain habitat types (J. C. Torres-Mura in litt. 1999, P. Hodum in litt. 2007). There is also limited evidence of predation on chicks by House Mice Mus musculus, but this does not appear to be widespread (Hodum 2009). Dogs also depredate the species. Goat impacts include habitat alteration through native plant consumption and also, at times, direct collapses of burrows (Hulm 1995, J. C. Torres-Mura in litt. 1999, P. Hodum in litt. 2007, J. C. Torres-Mura in litt. 2007, Hodum 2009). Despite attempts to reduce the goat population, it remains high (P. Hodum pers. obs.). Cows may also have a similar effect. Flash flooding in 2002 caused severe localised habitat loss with an estimated 30,000 burrows destroyed (Hodum and Wainstein 2003). In 1995, a fire destroyed habitat at the edge of the principal colony and directly killed thousands of birds (J. C. Torres-Mura in litt. 1999, P. Hodum in litt. 2007). Light pollution also represents a threat. On overcast nights, especially those with poor visibility due to rain and/or drizzle, lights in the village attract birds, occasionally causing collisions with structures in the village (Hodum 2009). The village is inhabited from September to May, during the period of lobster harvesting (P. Hodum in litt. 2007). The species is potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its altitudinal distribution, currently a range of approximately 500 m, falls entirely within 2,000 m of the highest mountain top within its range (1,649 m).

Rats also represent a threat, because, since 2005, rats have managed to swim out to breeding islets on multiple occasions, including invasions of Nonsuch Island in 2015 and 2016 (N. Carlile in litt. 2016). So far these have been detected and the rats controlled with only minor chick mortality, but this is an ongoing threat that is only at a negligible severity due to intensive conservation interventions. A single, subadult, Snowy Owl Bubo scandiacus, the first ever recorded in Bermuda, on Nonsuch Island was eradicated after having eaten 5% of the population (Dickinson 2007). Swarms of feral European honeybee have taken over burrows and also killed at least one chick, but ongoing control using insecticide has been successful (Madeiros et al. 2012). The threat of sea-level rise and increased storm activity appears real, with five or more major floods affecting burrows in the 1990s, after 25 years without significant problems (Wingate et al. 1998). Category three hurricane Fabian in 2003 overwashed three of the four breeding islets, damaging or destroying a significant number of nest burrows (J. Madeiros in litt. 2005). This, however, does not seem to have caused population level impacts. Light pollution from the international airport continues, but those lights intense enough and orientated high enough to potentially cause disruption to Cahows on their breeding islets have been realigned or had hoods fitted to reduce the impact (Madeiros 2005). As a result of this, light pollution does not seem to be causing significant declines. In the past, its recovery has been hampered by competition from White-tailed Tropicbird Phaethon lepturus for nest-sites. Successful use of wooden 'baffles' at the entrance to burrows prevents access by White-tailed Tropicbirds alongside the provision of artificial tropicbird nest sites has relieved the pressure on Bermuda Petrel.","In 2005, the population was thought to include 71 breeding pairs (J. Madeiros in litt. 2005). By 2011, the population reached 98 nesting pairs (Madeiros 2011).",Increasing,"Pterodroma cahow once bred abundantly throughout Bermuda (to UK). It was thought extinct for almost three centuries, until reported (with specimens) during the first half of the 20th century. In 1951, 18 pairs were rediscovered breeding on suboptimal rocky islets (total area 1 ha) in Castle Harbour. Intensive management has resulted in slow but steady increases, and the population was estimated at 250 birds in 2005 (J. Madeiros in litt. 2005), with 70 pairs fledging a record 40 young in 2003 (Madeiros 2003), and 71 pairs fledging 35 young in 2005 (J. Madeiros in litt. 2005). More recently, 40 young fledged in 2008 from 85 established active nest sites and at least 35 chicks hatched in 2009 (Madeiros unpubl. data). By 2011, the population reached 98 nesting pairs (Madeiros 2011). From 40 chicks on all islands in 2008, 21 chicks were translocated in May to Nonsuch, forming the last year of a translocation project (Madeiros 2008). Fourteen individuals fledging from Nonsuch Island after translocation in 2005 and 2006 were observed in 2009 returning to the island and entering artificial burrows. One chick was born on the island in 2009 (Madeiros unpubl. data). By 2011, 22 translocated birds have returned to Nonsuch, and 8 more translocated birds returned to the original nesting islets. Non-translocated birds have also been recorded on Nonsuch indicating a sufficient nucleus of translocated birds to attract non-translocated individuals into the colony (Madeiros 2011). In the non-breeding season, birds probably move north into the Atlantic, following the warm waters on the western edges of the Gulf Stream (Wingate 1997). There are confirmed records off the coast of North Carolina, Virginia and Massachusetts, U.S.A. (D. S. Lee in litt. 1998, Wingate et al. 1998, Nisbet et al. 2013, Maderios et al. 2014, Adams et al. 2014, Sattelmeyer et al. 2015), and one bird was captured in the Azores in November 2002, in November 2003 and in December 2006 (Bried 2003, J. Bried in litt. 2010). ","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I. Since 1961, there has been management of nesting-grounds, including the creation of artificial burrows, periodic removal of rats and the elimination of nest-site competition from Phaethon lepturus (by installing baffles over burrow entrances). As part of the Bermuda Conservation Programme, potential breeding islands (e.g. Nonsuch) have been reforested with native flora in an attempt to attract nesting petrels (Wingate et al. 1998). The Castle Harbour islands are a National Park and Nature Reserve (J. Madeiros in litt. 2005). In 2004 and 2005 efforts were made to attract adult Bermuda Petrels, displaced from low-lying nest burrows destroyed by hurricane Fabian, on the main breeding islet to a new artificial burrow complex built on a more elevated section of the islet. Using a combination of a sound attraction system set up among the new nests and physical translocation of adult individuals from the destroyed sites, three pairs occupied burrows in the new complex by March 2005 (J. Madeiros in litt. 2005). A project has also been conducted to establish a new nesting colony on the Nonsuch Island Living Museum, which is much larger and contains more suitable breeding habitat than the present suboptimal breeding islets. The project involved physical translocation of chicks from the present breeding islets to a new complex of artificial burrows on Nonsuch, so that they would imprint on the new site and return when mature to establish their nests at the new location. In 2004, the trial year of the project took place with 14 chicks moved to Nonsuch, where they were fed and monitored every other day until departure, with all fledging successfully. In 2005, 21 chicks were translocated, with all again fledging successfully by mid-June. In 2009, the first adult-fed Bermuda Petrel for 400 years hatched on Nonsuch Island (Dobson 2009). So far, 79 relocated chicks have fledged on Nonsuch, with only one fatality (Dickinson 2007). A Sound Attraction System was also set up in 2007 to help encourage birds to stay and prospect on Nonsuch, and overcome any tendency for young birds to be attracted back to the activity at the original nesting islets (Madeiros 2008). A total of 171 fledglings was ringed between 2002-2007, with 31 confirmed having returned (including 4 recaptured on Nonsuch Island), representing cohorts from four nesting seasons, 2002 to 2005 (Madeiros 2008). Rats have managed to get to Nonsuch (N. Carlile in litt. 2016), but so far these have been detected and the rats controlled with only minor chick mortality. Additionally, a single, subadult, Snowy Owl Bubo scandiacus, the first ever recorded in Bermuda, on Nonsuch Island was eradicated after having eaten 5% of the population (Dickinson 2007).Conservation Actions ProposedMaintain all management activities at current nesting-grounds. Investigate whether contaminants are increasing egg failure (Wingate 1997). Continue to manage the new breeding colony on Nonsuch Island (Wingate 1997, Madeiros 2003, J. Madeiros in litt. 2005).

It has already been extirpated from some sites, and declines are likely to continue as a result of habitat loss and degradation, hunting and invasive predators.","Field investigations on Hispaniola suggest that Black-capped Petrels lay eggs in mid- to late January, chicks hatch in mid- to late March and fledglings depart the colony sites in mid-June to early July (Simons et al. 2013). All nests located to date are at high elevations (&gt;1,500 m), and while most are in inaccessible areas (steep slopes, heavily forested) some are not (E. Rupp, in litt.). Nesting success from monitoring over 4 years was 70-77% (n = 47 nests) with abandonment and predation causing most failures (E. Rupp, in litt.)Nesting birds commute long distances from breeding to foraging sites, typically feeding in flocks. It is primarily nocturnal and crepuscular, feeding on squid, fish, crustaceans, and Sargassum. In its primary foraging range, the Black-capped Petrel is most influenced by the position of the Gulf Stream, a dynamic current system, and not sea surface temperature or depth. (Simons et al. 2013).","The increased frequency of fires represents a significant threat to the Black-capped Petrel through habitat loss, degradation and direct mortality. Fires and electric lights can cause the birds to become confused and disorientated causing mortality through collisions or grounding of the birds (Wingate 1964). Once grounded, many birds are unable to regain flight, leaving them vulnerable to predation and starvation. A number of electric communication towers are located on mountaintops close to petrel breeding grounds and are often stabilised with multiple guy wires and well lit (Goetz et al. 2012). These towers appear to be a considerable source of mortality, with a two-night investigation in 2013 finding several dead and grounded birds below a single tower, as well as hearing birds hitting the guy wires (A. Brown in litt. 2013). Mitigation efforts are in place for some towers and have greatly reduced the impact at these locations however further towers require investigation and modification (A. Brown in litt. 2013). Small-holder farming, cattle ranching and logging for charcoal are all significant sources of habitat loss, despite being illegal within the forests of Sierra De Baoruco National Park in the Dominican Republic (BirdLife International 2016). Rats and Feral cats are abundant at all known Black-capped Petrel breeding locations and, although their current impact on the species is unknown, in other ecologically similar petrels these species are responsible for nest failure and fledgling and adult mortality (Goetz et al. 2012). Dogs, pigs and mongoose may also predate the species. Direct consumption by humans is implicated in the extirpation of Black-capped Petrel on Martinique and Guadeloupe (Lee 2000), and this intentional use is ongoing in other areas. The gathering of terrestrial plants across the Black-capped Petrel’s range is not thought to cause significant declines. Mercury concentrations in tissues from specimens of the species were found to be considerably higher than in other species studied (Whaling et al. 1980, Simons et al. 2013) but impacts are unclear and likely restricted to lowered reproductive success rather than direct mortality.","The population is estimated as no more than 1,000 breeding pairs, perhaps as few as 500, and a total population of 2,000–4,000 birds.",Decreasing,"Pterodroma hasitata is confirmed as breeding in Hispaniola (comprising the nations of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). The population there is estimated as no more than 1,000 breeding pairs, perhaps as few as 500, and a total population of 2,000–4,000 birds. The highest density of nests and most of the population occurs on La Visite Ridge in the western extent of the Massif de la Selle, Haiti. Smaller populations occur eastward along the Massif de la Selle and across the border in the Sierra de Bahoruco of the Dominican Republic, as well as around Pic Macaya in Massif de la Hotte in western Haiti. Radar surveys and aural observations indicate that small populations occur in other areas to the north and east in the Dominican Republic but nests have yet to be located (E. Rupp in litt.) Taking into account each of these known and suspected breeding sites, all of which are quite small, an area of occurrence estimate of 20 km2 is reasonable (E. Rupp in litt.).Radar surveys conducted in Dominica in January 2015 strongly suggest that Black-capped Petrels persist there; hundreds of petrel-like targets were recorded over 17 separate coastal and inland flight corridors, and eight individual Black-capped Petrels were observed over 5 locations (Brown 2015). These data, when coupled with recent observations of downed Black-capped Petrels on the island, suggests that there are still individuals breeding on the island, although the last confirmed nesting date was 1862.Black-capped Petrels previously nested on Guadeloupe and Martinique, but have not been documented there since before 1900. However, hope persists for rediscovery on Guadeloupe (A. Chabrolle in litt.) based on offshore observations and the presence of inaccessible island peaks. Likewise, hope persists for Cuba. Though there is no documentation of Black-capped Petrels nesting in Cuba in the past or currently, there have been observations of birds flying inland at dusk from a known foraging area. Black-capped Petrels are highly pelagic and undertake long-distance foraging trips. A compendium of about 5,000 at-sea observations indicates that waters in or adjacent to the Florida Current and the Gulf Stream between northern Florida and southern Virginia provide a distinct and relatively confined foraging range of Black-capped Petrels, with concentrations observed there throughout the year. In the Caribbean Sea, Black-capped Petrels can occur within the inter-island regions, straits and offshore zones of both the Greater and Lesser Antilles, but still primarily east of 80°W. The first satellite tracking of this species (three individuals) suggest a similar, but more spatially expansive range, including regular occurrence in the Caribbean Sea between Hispaniola and South America and regular occurrence east of primary foraging area indicated by the at-sea observations (Jodice et al. 2015). ","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions Underway An International Black-capped Petrel Conservation Group has formed and facilitates communication and coordination among researchers and conservationists concerned about the species. Partners have greatly advanced understanding of occurrence, abundance, threats, and breeding ecology and continue to undertake research as they embark on conservation strategies to reduce threats. Community engagement to improve socioeconomic conditions and reduce unsustainable agriculture is underway adjacent to nesting sites on the Haitian-Dominican Republic border (IBCPCG 2016). Conservation Actions ProposedDevelop and undertake conservation strategies to halt encroachment in Haiti and improve park management (e.g. fire control) in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Continue surveys to determine distribution on Hispaniola, Dominica and at-sea and to determine presence on Cuba, Jamaica and Guadeloupe.

Its diet comprises mainly of fish and squid, with minor proportions of crustaceans and sea-striders, feeding largely at night by surface-seizing. The breeding season begins in April or May, with individuals forming colonies in a wide variety of habitats on offshore islands. Nests can be burrows, crevices, cracks or caves, under debris or vegetation cover (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","The following information refers to the species' European range only: Predation by cats Felis catus, House Rats Rattus rattus and endemic invertebrates occurs in large portions of the breeding range in the North East Atlantic (Cabral et al. 2005, Matias et al. 2009). Feral cats are considered a major driver of the present distribution of the species, for example on the Azores where breeding areas are restricted to steep cliffs wherever cats are present and local extinctions may have been caused by cat predation in the past. House Rats are present on many of the islands on which the species breeds or would be likely to breed, and, along with cats, is thought to be one of the main determinants of the current breeding distribution. In one colony on Madeira predation of Shearwater chicks by Madeiran Wall Lizards Teira dugessii has been recorded in up to 10% of nests, however no overall impact on colony breeding success has been found and lizard predation is highly unlikely to have an impact on the species on a population level (Matias et al. 2009). The large colony in Desertas Island, Madeira suffers intense human exploitation for food or fish bait, which also occurs at a lower level in other North East Atlantic sites, although not in the Salvage Islands, Madeira following the declaration of the islands as a national park (Carboneras et al. 2014). The species may be at risk of incidental capture in longline fisheries, but as yet, no significant effects of bycatch on adult mortality have been documented (Waugh et al. 2012). Due to the species’ foraging habit and wide range overlapping with many commercial fishing lanes, it is thought to suffer a heightened risk of mortality from oil spills and other marine pollution. Light pollution at night might be an important cause of mortality in some areas, and tourism and recreational developments may reduce available habitat in breeding colonies on the Canary Islands, Madeira and Azores (Carboneras et al. 2014).","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number c.500,000-1,000,000 individuals, while national population estimates include: c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 individuals on migration in China; &lt; c.100 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Taiwan and c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 individuals on migration in Japan (Brazil 2009).

It is therefore precautionarily classified as Near Threatened as it almost meets the requirements for listing as threatened under criteria A2abe+3be+4abe. Further data are required from across its range to quantify the trend.,"This marine species can be found over both pelagic and inshore waters. It feeds mainly on fish and squid which it catches by surface-seizing and shallow plunges. It often associates with other seabirds and will follow fishing boats. Breeding begins in March in colonies on offshore islands, occupying burrows on forested hills. It undergoes transequatorial migration (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","Introduced mammals poses the greatest threat to the population, with cats Felis catus and rats Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus being present throughout the species’s range. Rats have invaded at least three of the Japanese breeding islands, with current impacts largely unknown, but likely to affect fledgling success and egg predation (Lee 2010). The shearwaters appear to suffer significant impacts from rats on Mikura-Jima, which is populated by c.300 people and is popular with tourists, thus making an eradication programme problematic and the subsequent reintroduction of rats more likely (Oka et al. 2002, J. Croxall in litt. 2011). Feral cats may also be inflicting increasing mortality on the Mikura-Jima population through predation on chicks, young birds and adults (N. Oka per M. Sato in litt. 2012, S. Uematsu in litt. 2012). Efforts are being taken to capture and neuter feral cats, however due to pressure from the public, cats are hard to eliminate. Currently, climate change is affecting foraging distribution and hence energetic budgets of adults. It is further predicted that whole colonies may be affected in the future as prey populations shift distribution in response to climate change. In addition to these threats, the species is also susceptible to fisheries bycatch (Birds Korea 2010, J. Croxall in litt. 2011), but the impact has not been quantified. Research suggests the Fukushima nuclear accident may have had negative impacts on birds breeding on Mikura Island, with reduced vitamin A levels detected in chicks following the release of radioactive material (Uematsu et al. 2014). The researchers suggest that additional negative impacts may be expected in the population in the future.","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number c.3,000,000 individuals, while national population estimates include: c.100-10,000 breeding pairs, c.50-1,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in China; c.100,000-1,000,000 breeding pairs, c.10,000 individuals on migration and c.10,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in Japan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"This species is found in the western Pacific, breeding on the coast and on offshore islands of Japan, Russia, and on islands off the coasts of China, North Korea and South Korea.

The global population has been estimated to number c. 3,000,000 individuals (Brooke 2004). In Japan, where the majority of the species’s world population breeds, there are 11 islands that are each thought to be inhabited by more than 10,000 breeding pairs (Oka 2004). A recent survey on the island of Nakanokamishima estimated the population at 5,566 individuals and 2,783 nests (Yamamoto et al. 2015). According to islanders, the species appears to have been declining rapidly on Mikura-Jima, but quantitative data are not available (S. Uematsu in litt. 2012).

It feeds mostly on fish, with some cephaolopods, crustaceans and insects. It catches prey mainly on the wing by dipping but also by surface-seizing or pursuit-plunging. It will congregate with other seabirds and dolphins when around schooling fish, and will often attend trawlers and smaller fishing boats. Its breeding season is very variable nesting in burrows in colonies on offshore islands or atolls (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","Competition with commercial fisheries likely poses the greatest threat to this species. Over-exploitation of tuna fisheries is greatly reducing prey availability (Brooke 2004) as the shearwaters rely on tuna to herd shoals of small fish to the surface where they become available for surface-feeding (Ratcliffe 1999). Human disturbance by visitors to islands where the species breeds have been found to negatively affect breeding success (Benoit and Bretagnolle 2002). Brown Rats Rattus norvegicus were previously present on many of the offshore islands where this species bred, and in some cases caused local extinction of populations. Following the eradication of rats from several islands, the species has reclaimed past territories, and is again successfully breeding in these areas (Smith et al. 2006). The presence of feral cats Felis catus is encouraged through feeding by humans, and are causing a much lower fledging rate for chicks on Malaekahana (Smith et al. 2002). Small amounts of plastic have been found in Wedge-tailed Shearwater chicks (in majority smaller than 1cm2), but none in adults as of yet. If plastic pollution in the foraging areas increases, this could potentially impact fledging success and eventually adult mortality (Verlis et al. 2013). Increased sea surface temperature has been demonstrated to reduce the provisioning rate, and above a particular temperature threshold reproductive success is nil (Chambers et al. 2011). At present this impact appears restricted to a minority of the breeding population.","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number &gt;5,200,000 individuals, while national population sizes have been estimated at c.50-10,000 individuals on migration in Taiwan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Japan (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"The Wedge-tailed Shearwater ranges throughout the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans roughly between latitudes 35°N and 35°S, breeding on a large number of oceanic islands and on the east and west coasts of Australia (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"",Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It feeds on krill, small fish, salps and jellyfish (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Heather and Robertson 1997).","This species is at risk from bycatch throughout its range. It was previously caught in north Pacific drift-nets (Gould et al. 1998), and is still potentially at risk from set-nets. It may be caught on longlines, in trawling operations and on hand and reel lines, but bycatch levels have not been quantified and documented evidence is scarce (Taylor 2000, Tennyson et al. 2012). In recent decades, the Hauraki Gulf has been subject to intensive purse-seine fishing of pelagic fish which has interfered with an important foraging area and may have impacted the species through food resource depletion. Perhaps as a linked effect of this fishery, populations of Red-billed Gulls Larus scopulinus on the Mokohinau Islands have crashed from c.20,000 birds in the 1960s to fewer than 500 birds in 2011 (G. Taylor in litt. 2011). Further investigation is required. In addition, climate change is anticipated to have a significant effect on this species due to its limited range (the population is restricted to an islands with a maximum altitude of 218 m [BirdLife International unpubl. data]), and its observed sensitivity to climatic fluctuations and apparent lower productivity during La Niña years. The poor breeding success recorded on Aorangi Island in 2011 may have been related to a strong La Niña event in 2010-2011, but data from some birds fitted with geolocators indicated that incubation shifts were around twice the length of those published in the 1980s (G. Taylor in litt. 2012). Domestic Pigs Sus domesticus were previously present on Aorangi Island, but eradicated in the 1930s, when the island was declared a reserve. Vegetation and soil conditions has subsequently greatly improved (Heather and Robertson 1997).","The total population is estimated at 2.5 million birds (Marchant and Higgins 1990), although this estimate is likely too high (G.

Between 1938 and 1981, the population on Aorangi increased from c.200 to c.200,000 pairs (Harper 1983, Heather and Robertson 1997). However, surveys in 2011-13 suggested that there are around 100,000 burrows, similar to estimates from Bartle in 1960s (Waugh et al. 2013). In 2011, breeding success on Aorangi Island was noted to be very low, with only 16 chicks found in the 150 burrows sampled (G. Taylor in litt. 2012). The total population has been estimated at 2.5 million birds (Marchant and Higgins 1990), although this now regarded as too high (G. Taylor in litt. 2012, Waugh et al. 2013). The species migrates to the northern Pacific Ocean, from Japan to North America and east to California, and is occasionally found off South America (Heather and Robertson 1997, Taylor 2000). The main non-breeding moult zone appears to be the Emperor Seamounts, a chain of underwater volcanos northwest of Hawaii (G.Taylor in litt. 2016).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe eradication of pigs from Aorangi in 1936 caused a massive increase in the population, with the recolonisation probably coming from the nearby predator-free island, Tawhiti Rahi (Heather and Robertson 1997). Fishing has been banned at the Poor Knights Islands Marine Reserve since 1996 and entry onto the island reserve is prohibited (M. Szabo in litt. 2004). The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) established the world's first mandatory ""area to be avoided"" for large shipping vessels, including oil tankers, around the islands in 2004 (M. Szabo in litt. 2004). Breeding islands have permanent poisoned bait stations and each island is checked every year for any evidence that rodents have arrived (G. Taylor in litt. 2012). The species has been the subject of tracking studies utilising geolocators (2011-2013). These data show the birds are a pelagic species, making extensive use of oceanic seas well east of the North Island (including the Louisville Ridge), and also the Chatham Rise and Bounty Trough (east of the South Island) during the breeding season and migrate to the Emperor Seamounts in the NW Pacific Ocean during the austral winter (G. Taylor in litt. 2016).Conservation Actions ProposedComplete an accurate population census (including on Aorangi Island), to better assess breeding numbers (Waugh et al. 2013), assess the current status of breeding on Simmonds Islands and identify any signs of prospecting on other island groups. Establish monitoring plots on Poor Knights to determine the rate and pattern of colony expansion (Taylor 2000). Quantify the impact of bycatch during fishing activities and also assess whether competition with commercial fisheries for surface shoaling fish may be affecting the breeding population. If judged necessary, work with fisheries to develop bycatch reduction measures. ",Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Hence it is listed as Vulnerable. If invasive species, harvesting of chicks, bycatch in fisheries or other factors are found to be causing population declines, the species might warrant uplisting to Endangered.","Birds arrive at the colonies in early October-November. Eggs are laid in December, with fledging and dispersal in late April-late May (Guicking et al. 1999, P. Hodum unpubl. data). On Robinson Crusoe, nesting has been recorded in burrows scattered throughout badly eroded, generally sparsely vegetated but occasionally forested habitat at elevations of 50-390 m. On Santa Clara, the species breeds in scattered colonies in eroded terrain at elevations from 15-300m (Hodum and Wainstein 2003). On Isla Mocha, the colony is in forest (predominant tree Aextoxicon punctatum), with the highest burrow densities along mountain ridges and between the roots of old-growth trees up to 390 m (Guicking et al. 1999, D. Guicking and P. H. Becker in litt. 1999). It feeds primarily in offshore waters over the continental shelf but also in pelagic waters (Hodum et al. 2004), mostly on fish (sardines Strangomera bentincki and anchovies Engraulis ringens [Guicking et al. 2001]), squid and to a lesser extent, crustaceans (D. Guicking and P. H. Becker in litt. 1999). Birds breeding on Santa Clara demonstrate a diet dominated by fish, with squid comprising a smaller proportion of the diet (CEC 2005).","Interactions with fisheries potentially poses a major threat to this species (Guicking et al. 2001, CEC 2005, Mangel et al. 2012). Birds have been found entangled in fishing gear near colonies and in the non-breeding range (Guicking et al. 1999, D. Guicking and P. H. Becker in litt. 1999, Mangel et al. 2012). The distribution of longline commercial fishing activities overlap both spatially and temporally with the species’ wintering range over the continental shelf of North America, making the risk of interacting with the fishing fleet highly likely (CEC 2005). Bycatch mortality has been recorded in artisanal fisheries off the coast of Ecuador and Peru (Mangel 2012) which are poorly regulated and consist of a considerable number of small longline vessels whose overall impact may exceed that of large-scale fisheries. In Chile, capture by small vessels represents at least 76% of the overall bycatch of this species (Suazo et al. 2014, 2016). Predation by cats Felis catus and Coatimundis Nasua nasua on Robinson Crusoe, and cats and dogs Canis lupus familiaris on Mocha (Guicking et al. 1999) represents another significant threat. The population of coatimundi appears to have declined from historical levels on Robinson Crusoe but predation is still being documented (P. Hodum in litt. 2017). On Isla Mocha, burrows excavated by dogs have been found, but there is no evidence of significant predation occurring (P. Hodum in litt. 2017). European Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus compete with shearwaters for burrows on Robinson Crusoe but were eradicated from Santa Clara in 2003 with a resultant 40% increase in the proportion of burrows occupied by breeding pairs (Hodum et al. 2017). Soil erosion by goats Capra aegagrus hireus and rabbits affects populations on Robinson Crusoe (Guicking et al. 1999, J. C. Torres-Mura in litt. 1999). At present, due to the highly restricted distribution of goats on the island, their impacts are minimal, in contrast to the pervasive presence of rabbits in all breeding colonies on Robinson Crusoe (P. Hodum pers. comm.). Cattle Bos taurus in one colony on Robinson Crusoe cause soil erosion and burrow collapses, but the core area of the colony is protected by a cattle-proof fence (Gladics and Hodum 2010); yet, cattle still impact burrows outside this area, although to a lesser extent (P. Hodum in litt. 2017). Both House Rats Rattus rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus occur on Isla Mocha and Robinson Crusoe, but their impacts are unknown (Hodum and Wainstein 2003). Stable isotope analyses of rat tissue suggest they are feeding at lower, terrestrial trophic levels, and no evidence has been found of eggs or chicks consumed by rats in burrows (P. Hodum in litt. 2017). Chicks are harvested by islanders on Mocha in the fledgling season (March-May), with an estimated 20% of all chicks (3000-5000) taken in 1998 (Guicking et al. 1999, CEC 2005). More recently, due to enforcement of the prohibition of chick harvest begun in 2011, the magnitude of the chick harvest has decreased considerably, but illegal poaching still seems to occur most years (ACAP 2018). Quantitative estimates of harvest rates are difficult to obtain (P. Hodum pers. comm.). In 2018, illegal hunting was reported from Isla Mocha with c. 300 individuals killed in one incident (ACAP 2018). Plastic ingestion is widespread in the species, but there is no indication of what impact this currently has, or will have over the next three generations at either the individual or population level (P. Hodum in litt. 2017).","There may c. 29,573 breeding pairs (Muñoz and P. Hodum unpubl. data), which would imply around 150,000 individuals.",Unknown,"Ardenna creatopus is an east Pacific seabird that breeds only on Robinson Crusoe (a few thousand pairs in 1986 [Brooke 1987]; 2,750 occupied burrows in 2002 [Brooke 2004]; 10,055 burrows in 2016, of which up to 60% [6033] may be occupied [P. Hodum unpubl. data]) and Santa Clara (2,000-3,000 pairs in 1991 [Brooke 1987] and 4160 breeding pairs in 2016 [P. Hodum unpubl. data]) in the Juan Fernández Islands, and on Isla Mocha (13,000-17,000 pairs [Guicking et al. 1999], but possibly up to 25,000 pairs [D. Guicking and P. H. Becker in litt. 1999]) off the coast of Arauco, Chile. Recent evidence suggests a small colony on Isla Santa Maria in the Gulf of Arauco, Chile (P. Hodum unpubl. data). These sites combined indicate around 30,000 breeding pairs, which would imply a maximum of 100,000 individuals (Brooke 2004). Following breeding, the species disperses northward along the west coast of South America towards North America (CEC 2005). There are also isolated records during the non-breeding period in Chilean Patagonia (Imberti 2005, C.G. Suazo in litt. 2016). The migration is evident by its increasing presence along the continental shelf from the Gulf of California in Mexico to British Columbia in Canada, during April and May each year. Numbers peak between August and October, followed by a rapid decline in November, as birds return to their breeding colonies (CEC 2005). Based on ship-based observations, and satellite tracking, Ardenna creatopus ranges from the northern Gulf of Alaska (from approximately 59.87º N) to southern Chile (to roughly 50.00º S); primarily over the continental shelf and slope regions (Mangel et al. 2012 in ACAP 2013). A specimen has also been taken from the Atlantic coast of Argentina (Mazar Barnett and Navas 1998) and there are records from New Zealand and Australia (Patterson 1991, D. Guicking and P. H. Becker in litt. 1999). Despite probable declines in the past, populations in the Juan Fernández group appear to have been more or less stable over the past 15 years (CEC 2005, P. Hodum unpubl. data), although the breeding population on Santa Clara Island increased by 40% following the eradication of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) from the island in 2003 (P. Hodum unpubl. data). In contrast, populations on Isla Mocha may be declining owing to the effects of chick harvesting (CEC 2005), although breeding season monitoring between 2010-2016 suggested a stable population during that time (P. Hodum unpubl. data). Birds have been entangled in fishing gear near colonies and in the non-breeding range (Guicking et al. 1999, D. Guicking and P. H. Becker in litt. 1999, Mangel et al. 2012), and this potentially poses a major threat (Guicking et al. 2001, CEC 2005, Mangel et al. 2012).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions Underway The Juan Fernández Islands were designated as a national park in 1935 (protected from 1967) and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 1977. The islands have been nominated for World Heritage listing (Hulm 1995). The Chilean government began a habitat restoration programme in 1997 (J. C. Torres-Mura in litt. 1999), which concluded in 2003. The distribution of breeding colonies on Robinson Crusoe and Santa Clara was determined in 2002-2006 and resurveyed in 2016, while Mocha was surveyed in 2009 and again in 2016. The colony on Mocha is within a national reserve, which has had a management plan since 1998 and two reserve guards (Guicking et al. 1999, J. C. Torres-Mura in litt. 1999). Harvesting of chicks is illegal under Chilean law (Guicking et al. 1999), although this was unenforced until 2011. Since 2011, the park guards have worked with the federal police to enforce the prohibition on chick harvesting. In Canada, Ardenna creatopus was assessed as Threatened in 2004 (COSEWIC 2013). In 2005, the CEC published the North American Conservation Action Plan for the species (CEC 2005). In 2008, Canada released a recovery strategy for Ardenna creatopus (EC 2008). Oikonos Ecosystem Knowledge has worked on the Juan Fernández Archipelago since the 2001–2002 breeding season, monitoring annual reproductive success and predation rates, evaluating threats to the population, and undertaking conservation actions such as the construction of fences to exclude cattle and predatory mammals from colonies, and the restoration of colonies through planting of native plant species within protective exclosures (P. Hodum pers. comm.). Satellite and GPS tracking has been used to determine foraging areas of breeding birds from both Juan Fernández and Mocha, migratory routes and wintering areas and potential interactions with fisheries (Mangel et al. 2012, Oikonos unpubl. data). At-sea observer programmes have been used to monitor bycatch around Mocha, in small-scale Peruvian fisheries and on some commercial fisheries in Chile (Mangel et al. 2012, Albatross Task Force-Chile unpubl. data, Oikonos unpubl. data). Community-based education and conservation programmes have been underway since 2002 on Robinson Crusoe (CEC 2005, P. Hodum pers. comm.) and since 2010 on Mocha (P. Hodum pers. comm.).

Conduct quantitative assessment of population-level impacts of chick harvesting and reduce chick harvesting (Guicking et al. 1999). Expand the scale of habitat restoration through the planting of native plant species in and around breeding colonies. Assess the threat posed by the fishing industry, especially in Chilean waters (Guicking et al. 2001) and along migration routes, particularly in Peruvian waters.

Whilst breeding, the species alternates short foraging trips to local waters with long foraging trips (up to 17 days) to the Polar Frontal Zone. Short trips allow greater chick provisioning at the sacrifice of body condition, which is then recovered in richer sub-Antarctic waters. Diet includes fish (particularly mycotphids), crustaceans and squid (Weimerskirch and Cherel 1998). Feeding occurs in flocks of up to 20,000 birds, and it has been seen in association with cetaceans.  It is a trans-equatorial migrant, wintering off Aleutian Islands, some moving north of Bering Strait (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","The species suffered substantial mortality from entanglement in gill nets set for salmon in the Northern Pacific, particularly off Japan with c. 40,000 birds captured per annum (DeGange and Day 1991, Uhlmann 2003). Between 1952 and 2001, bycatch by North Pacific driftnet fisheries accounted for the mortality of 4,600,000 – 21,200,000 Short-tailed Shearwaters (Uhlmann et al. 2005). Light pollution represents a considerable threat to this species in parts of the range. A number much higher than anticipated, of (predominantly juvenile) shearwaters were found dead or injured as a result of being attracted to lights and grounded. Over a 15-year period of patrols on Phillip Island, Australia (1999-2013), 8,871 fledglings were found grounded, 39% of which were dead or dying. The incidence levels far exceed those of other Shearwater spp. (up to 8x), however less than 1% of fledglings produced annually are thought to be affected by mortality from attraction to artificial light (Rodriguez et al. 2014). Wreck (mass-mortality events) have been reported, e.g. at Bering Sea 1997 (Hyrenbach et al. 2001) and in Australia 2013 (Peter and Dooley 2014) and are potentially linked to ecosystem changes caused by climate change (Brooke 2004). Recent studies indicate that both young and adults suffer from the ingestion of marine plastic debris, with potentially lethal effects (Carey 2011). Competition for food by Pink Salmon Oncorhynchus gorbuscha may also be contributing to declines (Toge et al. 2011).","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number &gt; 23 million individuals, while national population estimates include: &lt;1,000 individuals on migration in Taiwan; &gt;1,000 individuals on migration in Japan and &gt;1,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"This species breeds on Tasmania and off the coast of south Australia, with the bulk of the population in the south-east.

Domestic Pigs Sus domesticus were the likely driver of the extinction of Manx Shearwater on Bermuda (Bourne 1957). Chick predation by Rats Rattus spp. and Feral Cats Felis catus occurs in many breeding colonies, but the impact has not been quantified (Zonfrillo 2007, Carboneras et al. 2014). Chick predation by Red Deer Cervus elaphus on Rhum appears to be a local phenomenon (Wormell 1969), but with negligible effects on the global population. Reports suggest that considerable human exploitation continues in the Islands of Madeira, Azores and Faroes (Carboneras et al. 2014), with the legal harvest on the Faroes amounting to 1,000–5,000 chicks per annum (Thorup et al. 2014). The level of impact on the local populations is unknown, but harvesting is likely to be contributory to limiting population size, especially in the smaller colonies. Attraction to artificial light poses another potential threat, with grounded fledglings being recorded from e.g. the Canary Islands (Rodriguez and Rodriguez 2009), however the total number killed as a result of light pollution is thought to be negligible in proportion to the global population (Carboneras et al. 2014). Habitat destruction and fire-induced damage to breeding colonies in the Canary Islands is believed to impact the local population. The species is also vulnerable to oil spills (Votier et al. 2005), other types of marine pollution (Camphuysen et al. 2010), bycatch in longlines and gillnets (Žydelis et al. 2013), and collisions and displacement due to wind farms, although this is currently considered a low risk for this species (Bradbury et al. 2014).","In Europe (which covers &gt;95% of the breeding range), the breeding population is estimated to be 342,000-393,000 breeding pairs, equating to 684,000-785,000 mature individuals or 1,026,000-1,177,500 individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

At South Georgia, this species is undergoing a rapid decline over three generations (70 years). On the Crozet and Kerguelen Islands, the populations rapidly declined between 1970-1986, then stabilised, but have recently declined again. Longline fishing is likely to be the main cause of decline in this species, causing reductions in adult survival and juvenile recruitment, and this threat is on-going.","Behaviour Diomedea exulans is a biennial breeding species, although about 30% of successful and 35% of failed breeders (on average) defer breeding beyond the expected year. Adults return to colonies in November, and eggs are laid over a period of 5 weeks during December and January. Most chicks hatch in March and fledge in December. Birds usually return to colonies when 5-7 years old, though they can return when as young as 3 years old. Birds can start breeding as young as 7 or 8 years old, but more typically at 10-12 years old (Tickell 2000). Wandering Albatross typically forages in oceanic waters, however considerable time is spent over shelf areas during certain stages of the breeding season (BirdLife International 2004). Satellite tracking has revealed that juvenile birds tend to forage further north than adults (Weimerskirch et al. 2006, British Antarctic Survey, unpubl. data), bringing them into greater overlap with longline tuna fleets which may be driving falls in recruitment rates (Weimerskirch et al. 1997). Females may also be at greater risk of being caught in tuna fisheries since they tend to forage further north than males (Nel et al. 2002, Weimerskirch et al. 2003, Pinaud and Weimerskirch 2007, Jiménez et al. 2016). It is mostly a diurnal breeder, taking most prey by surface-seizing (ACAP 2009). Habitat Breeding Wandering Albatross nests in open or patchy vegetation near exposed ridges or hillocks (Carboneras 1992). Diet Adults feed at sea mainly on cephalopods and fish, often following ships and feeding on offal and galley refuse (Carboneras 1992, Cherel and Klages 1998). Patagonian Toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides is the primary fish species in the diet, potentially obtained as discarded offal (Xavier et al. 2004). Foraging range This wide-ranging species has a circumpolar distribution, and both breeding and non-breeding birds have very large foraging ranges. Satellite tracking data indicate that breeding birds forage at very long distances from colonies (up to 4,000 km) and that foraging strategies change throughout the breeding season (Froy et al. 2015). A fledgling covered 6,590 km in 28 days after leaving the colony on Marion Island (Clokie 2007).","The observed decline of this species has been shown to be driven largely by incidental catch in fisheries, which has reduced adult survival and juvenile recruitment (Rolland et al. 2010, Pardo et al. 2017). Fisheries were responsible for a 54% decrease in numbers on the Crozet Islands between 1970 and 1986 (Weimerskirch et al. 1997). The South Georgia population is declining rapidly, but other populations (Prince Edward Islands and Crozet Islands) have shown signs of recovery. The South Georgia population disperses throughout the Southern Ocean during the nonbreeding season, although may be most at risk from longline fisheries operating in the south-west Atlantic throughout the year (Jiménez et al. 2014, 2016, Tancell et al. 2016), whereas the Crozet and Prince Edward Island populations are most vulnerable to pelagic longline fishing in the Indian Ocean and Australian region (Weimerskirch 1998, Nel et al. 2002c). The apparent recovery of populations from the Crozet and Prince Edward Islands during the early 1990s was ascribed to reduced fishing effort and relocation of fisheries away from foraging grounds, however increased effort in the late 1990s at various different localities may once again be impacting these populations (Weimerskirch et al. 1997, Nel et al. 2002b), as even low bycatch rates will affect the species due to the small population size (ACAP 2009). The Macquarie population was harvested extensively by sealers and despite recoveries in the early 20th century, it experienced subsequent declines that were also attributed to longline fisheries (de la Mare and Kerry 1994). Additionally, chicks are vulnerable to the accumulation of anthropogenic debris and fishing hooks, which may kill a small number annually (Nel and Nel 1999, Phillips et al. 2010, 2016). The impacts of predation by introduced species are severe for some breeding populations. On Kerguelen, in some years, certain colonies have suffered complete breeding failure due to chick predation by cats Felis catus (H. Weimerskirch in litt. 2008). House mice Mus musculus have been recorded attacking Wandering Albatross chicks on Marion Island since 2003 and continue to affect up to 1% of the population (Dilley et al. 2015). There has been extensive habitat loss and degradation at South Georgia (Islas Georgias del Sur) due to the activities of Antarctic Fur Seals Arctocephalus gazelle (ACAP 2009). Shifts in the oceanic habitat have been demonstrated to negatively impact the species, and are likely to be exacerbated with future climate change, and expected to cause significant declines over the next three generation period (Pardo et al. 2017). Several climatic variables have a significant correlation with mortality and breeding success, sometimes with different effects among different locations and on juvenile vs. adult survival (Pardo et al. 2017).","In 1998, the total annual breeding population was estimated at 8,500 pairs, equivalent to c. 28,000 mature individuals (Gales 1998). However, current estimates are 1,553 pairs on South Georgia (Georgias del Sur) (Poncet et al. 2006), 1,800 pairs on Prince Edward Island (2008, Ryan et al. 2009), c. 1,900 pairs on Marion Island (2013, ACAP 2009), c. 340 pairs on Iles Crozet (CNRS Chinzè Monitoring Database 2010), c. 354 pairs in Iles Kerguelen (CNRS Chinzè Monitoring Database 2011), and 4 pairs on Macquarie Island (DPIWPE 2010, unpublished data), making a total of c. 6,000 annual breeding pairs. Using the same ratio as Gales (1998) for estimating the number of mature individuals, this would equate to approximately 20,100 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Diomedea exulans breeds on South Georgia (Georgias del Sur) (c. 18% of the global breeding population), Prince Edward Islands (South Africa) (c. 44% of the global population), Crozet Islands and Kerguelen Islands (French Southern Territories) (approximately 38% of the global population) and Macquarie Island (Australia) (approximately four pairs breeding per year), with a total global population of c. 8,050 pairs breeding in any given year (ACAP 2009). At South Georgia, the population declined by 1.8% per annum between 1984 and 2004 (Poncet et al. 2006), and continued to decline by 1.8% per annum between 2004 and 2015 (A. Wolfaardt in litt. 2016). The population on Crozet declined by 54% between 1970 and 1986. From the mid-1980s to late 1990s, the Crozet, Kerguelen and Prince Edward Islands populations appeared to be stable or increasing (Weimerskirch et al. 1997, Weimerskirch and Jouventin 1998, Crawford et al. 2003, Ryan et al. 2003), but declines were later detected (H. Weimerskirch in litt. 2008, Ryan et al. 2009). Overall declines are estimated to exceed 30% over 70 years. Recovery is believed to be impeded by a decline in recruitment rate (Weimerskirch et al. 2006). Non-breeding and juvenile birds remain north of 50°S between subantarctic and subtropical waters with a significant proportion crossing the Indian Ocean to wintering grounds around the southern and eastern coast of Australia (Weimerskirch et al. 2014). A significant proportion of the Crozet and Kerguelen populations disperse into the Pacific and the western coast of South America (Weimerskirch et al. 2014, 2015). ","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II and ACAP Annex 1. Population monitoring and foraging studies are being undertaken at South Georgia (Georgias del Sur), the Prince Edward Islands, Crozet, Kerguelen and Macquarie. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has introduced measures which have reduced bycatch of albatrosses around South Georgia by over 99%. Recently, other Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, including the tuna commissions, have taken initial steps to reduce seabird bycatch rates. The Prince Edward Islands are a special nature reserve and Macquarie is a World Heritage Site. Large parts of the breeding colonies on the Crozet and Kerguelen Islands are now part of a Nature Reserve. On Macquarie, cats have been eradicated (Quin 2008), and the island was declared to be rabbit, rat and mouse-free in 2014 following a large eradication project which commenced in 2014 (Springer 2016).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue population monitoring programs at all sites to allow assessment of population trends, survival and production rates. Continue tracking studies to determine spatial and temporal overlap with fisheries for populations and life stages where these data do not exist. Promote adoption of best-practice mitigation measures in all fisheries within the species's range, including via intergovernmental mechanisms such as ACAP, FAO and Regional Fisheries Management Organisations.",Afrotropical|Neotropical|Oceanian,,false,false,Global
132642113,22698335,Phoebastria albatrus,Vulnerable,D2,2018,2018-08-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Vulnerable because, although conservation efforts have resulted in a steady population increase, it still has a very small breeding range, limited to Torishima and Minami-Kojima (Senkaku Islands), rendering it susceptible to stochastic events and human impacts.","Behaviour Phoebastria albatrus is a colonial, annually breeding species, with each breeding cycle lasting about 8 months. Birds begin to arrive at the main colony on Torishima Island in early October. A single egg is laid in late October to late November and incubation lasts 64 to 65 days. Hatching occurs in late December through January. Chicks begin to fledge in late May into June. There is little information on timing of breeding on Minami-kojima. First breeding sometimes occurs when birds are five years old, but more commonly when birds are aged six. It forages diurnally and potentially nocturnally, either singly or in groups primarily taking prey by surface-seizing (ACAP 2009). During the breeding season, individuals nesting off Japan forage over the continental shelf (Kiyota and Minami 2008). Habitat Breeding. Historically, it preferred level, open, areas adjacent to tall clumps of the grass Miscanthus sinensis for nesting. Diet It feeds mainly on squid, but also takes shrimp, fish, flying fish eggs and other crustaceans (ACAP 2009). It is routinely attracted to fishing vessels, where it feeds on discards, fish offal and regrettably also occasionally on baited hooks. ","Historical declines were driven by exploitation, the species being targeted primarily for its feathers, but also eggs and oil (ACAP 2009). Today, the main threat is posed by commercial fisheries. The species’ distribution overlaps with fisheries that occur in the shallower waters along continental shelf break and slope regions, e.g., Sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria and Pacific Halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis longline fisheries off the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia (Guy et al. 2013). The species is known to be killed in U.S. and Russian longline fisheries for Pacific Cod Gadus microcephalus and halibut. Since 1983, a total of 15 birds have been reported killed by fishing gear (USFWS 2012), but it is widely considered that the actual mortality from bycatch is considerably higher (USFWS 2008, COSEWIC 2013). Although there have been no reports of this species being taken in demersal longline fisheries in British Columbia, it has been suggested that one to two birds could be taken each year (COSEWIC 2013). Birds on Torishima have been observed with swallowed hooks that can be traced back to the Japanese fisheries that operate near the island (ACAP 2009). Other threats include mortality and habitat loss from the active volcano on Torishima, typhoons and potential oil spills (G.R. Balogh in litt. 2008). Models have shown that even small increases in chronic mortality rates, such as those resulting from bycatch, would have a greater impact on population trend than stochastic and theoretically catastrophic events, such as volcanic eruptions (Finkelstein et al. 2010).","At the end of the 2013-2014 breeding season, the global population was estimated to be 4,200 individuals, with 3,540 birds on Torishima, 650 birds on the two islands in the East China Sea and 10 birds on Ogasawara Islands. Eda et al. (2012) showed that two populations of Phoebastria albatrus existed about 1,000 years ago and suggested that descendants of each population have segregated breeding colonies on Torishima and on the two islands in the East China Sea. The sequence divergence between the two clades is greater than between other Diomedeidae sister species (Eda and Higuchi 2012). The trend of assortative mating was indicated among birds from the Torishima and the two islands in the East China Sea (Eda et al. 2016).",Increasing,"Phoebastria albatrus breeds on Torishima in the western Pacific and Minami-kojima and Kita-kojima in the East China Sea in Japan. Historically, there are believed to have been at least nine colonies south of Japan and in the East China Sea (Piatt et al. 2006). Its marine range covers most of the northern Pacific Ocean, but it occurs in highest densities in areas of upwelling along shelf waters of the Pacific Rim, particularly along the coasts of Japan, eastern Russia, the Aleutians and Alaska (to U.S.A.) (Piatt et al. 2006, Suryan et al. 2007). The species has also been encountered as far north as the Chukchi Sea (Day et al. 2013). During breeding (December - May) it is found in highest densities around Japan. Satellite tracking has indicated that during the post-breeding period, females spend more time offshore off Japan and Russia, while males and juveniles spend greater time around the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea and off the coast of North America (Suryan et al. 2007). Juveniles have been shown to travel twice the distances per day and spend more time within continental shelf habitat than adult birds (Suryan et al. 2008). The species declined dramatically during the 19th and 20th centuries owing to exploitation for feathers, and was believed extinct in 1949, but it was rediscovered in 1951. The current population is estimated, via direct counts and modelling based on productivity data, to be 4,200 individuals, with 3,540 birds on Torishima, 650 birds on 2 islands in the East China Sea and 10 birds in Ogasawara Islands (Japan) (H. Hasegawa in litt. 2014, Deguchi et al. 2017). In 1954, 25 birds (including at least six pairs) were present on Torishima. Given that there are now 650 breeding pairs on Torishima (H. Hasegawa in litt. 2014), the species has undergone an enormous increase since its rediscovery and the onset of conservation efforts. In Ogasawara Islands, a historic breeding site, one nesting pair has been observed on Mukojima in 2013 and one chick was produced in 2016 (Deguchi et al. 2017). Another pair was observed on Nakoudojima in 2014 and 2015 and one chick was produced in 2014 (Deguchi et al. 2017). In 2016, one additional unidentified pair produced a chick on Yomejima. In addition, in 2010, one nesting pair was observed on Kure Atoll (Hawaii), but was probably two females and thus, unsuccessful, and one chick was produced on Midway Atoll (M. Naughton pers. comm. 2011).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions Underway In 2001 and 2007, respectively, the USA and Canada released National Plans of Action to reduce the bycatch of seabirds in longline fisheries (NMFS 2001, DFO 2007). In 2002, the use of tori (streamer) lines became a mandatory condition of licence in commercial halibut, sablefish, and rockfish Sebastes spp. longline fisheries on Canada’s west coast (DFO 2007). In 2003, the Committee on the Conservation of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) assessed Phoebastria albatrus as Threatened in Canada (COSEWIC 2003); and in 2005, the species was added to Schedule 1 of Canada’s Species at Risk Act, as Threatened (EC 2008). In 2008, Canada and the USA released final recovery strategies for the species (EC 2008, USFWS 2008); and in 2013, Phoebastria albatrus was re-assessed by COSEWIC; and once again it was listed as Threatened (COSEWIC 2013). Mitigation measures have been established in the Alaska demersal longline fishery and in the Hawaii-based pelagic longline fishery (NOAA 2008). Streamer lines (both heavy weight lines for large boats and lightweight lines for smaller vessels) have been designed to keep birds from longline hooks as they are set, and these are being distributed free of charge to the Alaskan longline fleet (USFWS 2008), though they are not deployed in near-shore waters. In 2006, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission passed a measure which requires large tuna and swordfish longline vessels (&gt;24m long) to use a combination of two seabird bycatch mitigation measures when fishing north of 23 degrees North. Torishima has been established as a National Wildlife Protection Area and National Special Natural Monument. In 1981-1982, native plants were transplanted into the Torishima nesting colony in order to stabilise the nesting habitat and the nest structures. This has enhanced breeding success, with over 60% of eggs now resulting in fledged young. Decoys have been used to attract birds to nest at another site on Torishima since 1993 and the first pair started breeding at this new site in November 1995. The number of chicks fledged from this new colony has increased from one chick in 2004 to four chicks in 2005, 13 chicks in 2006 and 16 chicks in 2007. In October-November 2007, 35 eggs were laid at this new site (Sato 2009). To expedite new colony establishment, in 2007, the Japanese government approved a project that chicks translocated from Torishima were hand-reared on a non-volcanic and former breeding island, Mukojima, 350 km away, (Deguchi et al. 2012). From 2008-2012, 70 chicks were translocated and 69 chicks successfully fledged (Deguchi et al. 2014). 27 hand-reared birds returned to Mukojima at least once per breeding season from 2011-2016 (Deguchi et al. 2017). Two hand-reared birds successfully paired with naturally reared birds and fledged two chicks at Mukojima and neighbouring island, Nakodojima, 5 km away, during this period (Deguchi et al. 2017).Conservation Actions Proposed Continue to promote measures designed to protect this species from becoming hooked or entangled by commercial fishing gear. Promote conservation measures for the population of two islands in the East China Sea. Promote taxonomic re-evaluation through comparative studies of morphological, genetic, ecological, and ethological traits of birds on Torishima and the two islands in the East China Sea (Eda et al. 2016). Continue research into the at-sea distribution and marine habitat use through satellite telemetry studies.

Given the difficulty of predicting long-term trends for such a long-lived species, and the number of documented threats and the uncertainty over their future effects, the species is precautionarily projected to undergo a moderately rapid population decline over three generations (84 years), and as such qualifies as Near Threatened (nearly qualifies for listing as threatened under criterion A4bd).","Laysan Albatross is an annual breeder though, like other albatross species, each year a proportion of birds will skip a breeding season. Nests vary from a simple scoop in the sand to more elaborate nests where vegetation allows. Wisdom, a Phoebastria immutabilis female estimated to be 65 years old is still breeding (https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Midway_Atoll/wildlife_and_habitat/Wisdom_Profile.html). High rates of mate change (14%), super-normal clutches as a result of same-sex pairing (31% of pairs), observed on Oahu and Kauai, Hawaii are all previously unreported for the species (Young et al. 2008, 2009a Young and VanderWerf 2014). The high rates of same-sex pairing is thought to result from a slightly skewed sex ratio (57% female) (Young et al. 2008). Diet analysis indicates that it feeds primarily on cephalopods (Pittman et al. 2004), though also on a variety of fish, crustaceans and other invertebrates (Tickell 2000). Satellite tracking has revealed the large journeys made even while breeding (Fernandez et al. 2001, Naughton et al. 2007, S. Shaffer in litt. 2007). Breeding birds at Tern Island switch from a local unimodal foraging strategy during brooding, to a bimodal foraging strategy incorporating more distant, highly productive subarctic waters during the rearing period and responding to climatic variability readily (Hyrenbach et al. 2002, Kappes et al. 2010, Thorne et al. 2015). Reproductive success has been linked to foraging location, with pairs fledging chicks two years in a row not foraging near continental shelves (Edwards and Parrish 2008). Recent data has demonstrated that reproductive success is linked to the distance of the breeding grounds from the transition zone (closer resulting in higher reproductive success) and prevailing wind conditions in any given year (Thorne et al. 2015, 2016). It is thought that this ability may be influenced by information gathered during the non-breeding season (Edwards and Parrish 2008).","Populations were greatly reduced by feather and egg collecting in the late 1800s and early 1900s, and by high seas drift nets for squid and salmon that were active between 1978 and 1992. Prior to its closure, the high seas driftnet fishery killed over 17,500 Laysan Albatross in 1990 alone (Johnson et al. 1993). Current key threats include incidental capture in pelagic (Crowder and Myers 2002) and demersal longline fisheries (Stehn et al. 2001) in the North Pacific as well as in illegal high seas driftnet operations. Analyses in 2001 estimated that pelagic longliners in the North Pacific may kill 5,000-18,000 Phoebastria immutabilis per year, with 8,000 thought the most likely figure, while demersal longline operations in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska groundfish fisheries were estimated to kill c.715 birds per year (Crowder and Myers 2001). It has been recently estimated that on average, 156 Phoebastria immutabilis are taken annually in the Alaskan federal groundfish and Pacific Halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis fisheries, (in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, and the Gulf of Alaska Fishery Management Plan areas), targeting Pacific Cod Gadus macrocephalus, Sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria, and Halibut Hippoglossus spp.. Off Canada’s west coast, the estimated annual bycatch mortality of albatrosses (primarily Black-footed Albatross) averages 85 birds per year (range 25-128) (COSEWIC 2013, K. Morgan, unpublished data, 2016). The bycatch rates in Japanese and Taiwanese pelagic longline fisheries in the North Pacific are still largely unknown. Climate change poses an ongoing threat in terms of storms and flooding, and a future threat in terms of habitat alteration from sea-level rise. A majority of the population nests on low-lying islands and atolls and it is predicted that with climate change and the resulting rise in sea-level, there will be significant inundation and loss nesting habitat (Storlazzi et al. 2013, Reynolds et al. 2015). Other threats include pollution from oil spills, organochlorine, lead and plastic ingestion, as well as invasive species, human disturbance and conflicts with aircrafts (Harrison 1990, Ludwig et al. 1998, Finkelstein et al. 2003, Finkelstein 2006, Young et al. 2014). Chicks with large volumes of proventricular plastic have been reported to have fledging weights significantly lower than chicks with low amounts of plastic, and there is some evidence to suggest it may have affected survival rates in 1986, when the volume of plastic ingestion was at its highest (Sievert and Sileo 2008). Up to 10,000 chicks per year are potentially affected by lead poisoning from paint on buildings at Midway Atoll (Finkelstein 2006), and 7% of chicks on Sand Island fail to fledge from lead poisoning each year, with a predicted impact of 16% reduction in population size over the course of 50 years equating to 190,000 fewer birds (Finkelstein et al. 2010). Avian pox virus affects chicks on Midway and the Main Hawaiian Islands where introduced mosquitoes are present, but the associated declines are negligible (VanderWerf and Young 2016). Invasive predators also pose a threat. Dogs Canis lupus familiaris kill adults and chicks on inhabited islands in Hawaii. Observations from Guadalupe Island, Mexico, in December 2002 recorded that, of the 490 adults on the island, 35 were killed by feral cats Felis catus (7% of the total island breeding population that year, and 30% of the Punta Sur colony) (Keitt et al. 2006). Cats were also responsible for a tripling in nest failure rate at this colony (49%) compared with the nearby cat free Negro Islet colony (13%) (Keitt et al. 2006). Cat control around the colony from Jan-Mar 2003 removed 18 cats and curtailed adult mortality from cat predation, although cats continued to be seen around the colony after the breeding season ended (Keitt et al. 2006). It is likely that the population here had not experienced high levels of predation prior to 2002, as otherwise it would have been extirpated. Other introduced predators (notably the Polynesian rat Rattus exulans; Jones et al. 2008) may pose a minor threat to colonies in Mexico and on the Main Hawaiian Islands. Rats have been recorded killing adults on rare occasions, but this mortality is minimal and hence not believed to be driving significant declines. House mice Mus musculus on Sand Island began attacking adult Laysan Albatross in 2015, with the behaviour spreading rapidly in the following breeding season. An eradication is planned and trapping around the colony has minimised chick losses. In 2002, observations on Clarion Island, Mexico, reported zero breeding success from the 46 nesting pairs, largely as a result of predation by several endemic species (e.g. Clarion Raven Corvus corax clarionensis and Clarion Racer Masticophis anthonyi; Wanless et al. 2009).","The population is estimated to be more than c. 800,000 breeding pairs, equivalent to c.1,600,000 mature individuals (Arata et al. 2009). Midway Atoll, Laysan Island and French Frigate Shoals support 90% of the global breeding population.",Stable,"Phoebastria immutabilis breeds at 16 sites (nine with populations of greater than 100 pairs), mostly in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.) and U.S. Minor Outlying Islands, with additional small colonies in Japan and Mexico. The population is estimated to be more than c. 800,000 breeding pairs, with the largest colony at Midway Atoll (666,044 pairs, https://www.fws.gov/uploadedFiles/Region_1/NWRS/Zone_1/Midway_Atoll/Documents/Hatch%20Year%202015%20NR_FINAL(4).pdf), followed by Laysan Island, both in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (Arata et al. 2009). Population sizes at monitored colonies increased between 1980 and 1995 but have never reached the densities observed prior to large-scale harvests for feathers in the early 1900s. Data indicated a 32% decline during 1992-2002 (3.2% per annum) of birds breeding on the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where 99% of the global population is found (Gilman and Freifeld 2003, USFWS data per B. Flint 2003 pers comm.), though data from 2004 and 2006 indicate that the breeding population then rebounded, and that the overall population trend for 1992-2005 is stable (Naughton et al. 2007). On Oahu, Hawaii the small population has increased 27% annually since 1991, and numbered 555 adults in 2015, due primarily to immigration with some local recruitment (Young et al. 2009a, VanderWerf and Young 2016). The island of Kauai contain ~1,000 birds scattered amongst more than a dozen sites with an increasing trend comparable to Oahu (Young et al. 2014). A population began nesting in Mexico in the 1980s and has been increasing since then. The current population is about 400 pairs at four sites (46 pairs on Clarion Island in 2002; Wanless et al. 2009), though this represents less than 0.1% of the global population (Arata et al. 2009). Breeding populations were extirpated from Wake and Johnston atolls (U.S.A.) and Minami Torishima (Japan) in the central Pacific. Ship-based observations, satellite tracking and fisheries bycatch reveal the wide distribution of Phoebastria immutabilis in the North Pacific, ranging from the northern Bering Sea to tropical waters in the South (10-15 degrees North) (Fisher and Fisher 1972, Fernandez et al. 2001, Hyrenbach et al. 2002, Shaffer et al. 2004). ","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions Underway All of the major Hawaiian breeding localities are part of the US National Wildlife Refuge system or State of Hawaii Seabird Sanctuaries and, in 2006, the Papahânaumokuâkea Marine National Monument was established, encompassing all of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Originally, Papahānaumokuākea protected an area of 362,073 km2; in August 2016, the National Marine Monument was expanded to 1,508,870 km2. Three breeding sites, supporting over 90% of the breeding population, are either counted directly or sampled at regular intervals. In 1991, a 50 Nautical Mile Protected Species Zone was established around the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (primarily to protect monk seals). No longline fishing is allowed in this zone. In 2001 and 2007, respectively, USA and Canada released National Plans of Action to reduce the bycatch of seabirds in longline fisheries (NMFS 2001, DFO 2007). In 2002, the use of tori (streamer) lines became a mandatory condition of licence in commercial halibut, sablefish, and rockfish Sebastes spp. longline fisheries on Canada’s west coast (DFO 2007). Awareness programmes and mitigation trials have been started in several major longline fleets operating within the foraging range of this species; for example, the Hawaiian longline fishing fleet is required to use measures to reduce bycatch of seabirds. In 2006, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission adopted a measure to require large longline vessels to use at least two seabird bycatch mitigation measures when fishing north of 23 degrees North. Predator control programs are conducted at colonies in Mexico and the main Hawaiian Islands (Young et al. 2013). Conservation Actions Proposed Continue monitoring population trends and demographic parameters. Continue satellite-tracking studies to assess temporal and spatial overlap with longline fisheries. Adopt best-practice mitigation measures in longline fisheries within the species's range. Continue and enhance awareness programmes in all longline fleets. Re-evaluate the location of the current boundary (23o N) for required use of seabird mitigation measures in the U.S. pelagic longline fisheries (Naughton et al. 2007). Continue and enhance control/eradication programs for Verbesina in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and introduced predators in Hawaii and Mexico. Continue and enhance lead-based paint removal from sites (e.g. USFWS 2005-2008 efforts to remove paint from about 14 out of 95 structures with lead-based paint on Sand Island; Finkelstein et al. 2010).",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Nests are a pedestal made of mud, peat, feathers and vegetation. Eggs are laid September to early October, and chicks fledge in late March to April. Young birds return to colonies from five years of age, and experienced breeders will attempt to breed in two of every three years. Breeding success ranges from 62-72% and 62-76% for Gough Island and Tristan de Cunha respectively (ACAP 2009). It usually breeds singly or in loose aggregations. It feeds by surface-seizing and occasionally diving, and also feeds in association with marine mammals or gamefish which bring baitfish to the surface. It is strongly attracted to fishing vessels and studies from shelf waters have shown scavenged food can comprise a large proportion of stomach contents. Habitat Breeding It builds nests built on tussock grass, on rocks and under trees. Diet When not scavenging, its diet is largely comprised of fish, but also cephalopods (ACAP 2009). In one study, cephalopods were predominant in the diet of birds caught by longlines, representing 73% of the total mass (Colabuono and Vooren 2007).","The main threat facing this species is incidental capture in commercial longline fisheries. There is an estimated bycatch mortality of at least 900 birds per annum off the coast of south-east Brazil, where it is known to be one of the most common species attending longline vessels (Olmos et al. 2000). It is also known to attend trawlers and longlining vessels off the west coast of southern Africa (Harrison 1985, Olmos 1997, Croxall and Gales 1998), where mortality has been recorded, but not quantified (Ryan et al. 2002). It is one of the most frequently killed species in longline fisheries off Namibia (Paterson et al. 2017). In addition, the species may still suffer some direct persecution; the harvest of chicks and adults on Tristan da Cunha was previously permitted under a local ordinance, but is now illegal and the practice appears to have discontinued, although some poaching of eggs and chicks may still occur (Rothwell 2005). Introduced House Mice Mus musculus are present on both Tristan da Cunha and Gough Island, and known to depredate seabird nests. Cuthbert et al. (2013) estimated that mice caused a minimum of 2% chick mortality on Gough Island. Despite low mean levels of predation, there was considerable local variation in chick mortality; at one site only 7% of chicks survived to fledge. Inspection of nests post-breeding revealed that c. 10% of nest cups had mouse burrow entrances directly into the cup (Cuthbert et al. 2013), suggesting that this mortality could be causing slow, significant declines.

The breeding season is protracted and eggs are laid asynchronously, with some pairs laying eggs while other pairs are in the midst of chick-rearing. At Southeast Farallon Island, Ashy Storm-petrels visit the colony year-round, and most breeding activity is concentrated in February through October (Ainley et al. 1990). At Santa Cruz Island, Ashy Storm-petrel nesting activity spans March through December (del Hoyo et al. 1992, S. Wolf in litt. 2007). Birds feed at sea on planktonic crustaceans and small fish and visit the colony at night. Foraging during the breeding season occurs mainly over continental shelves (92-98%), with aggregations coinciding spatially and seasonally with the spawning aggregations of sardines and anchovies (Adams and Takekawa 2008).","The species is threatened by increasing predation from native species. The seasonal residency of Burrowing Owls Athene cunicularia in the Farallons has increased, with autumn-visitant owls likely remaining through the winter due to the abundance of mice available since the eradication of rabbits has allowed more vegetation to go to seed. This has resulted in hyperpredation of Ashy Storm-petrels, especially following seasonal decreases in the mouse population (Mills 2016 and Nur et al. in press in Carter et al. 2016). Further declines in the Farallon colonies are thought to have occurred due to heavy predation by a large, and growing, population of Western Gulls Larus occidentalis (Ainley et al. 1974, Penniman et al. 1990, Sydeman et al. 1998 in Carter et al. 2016). Invasive species also pose a threat. On Anacapa Island, Ashy Storm-petrels were not confirmed breeding until after the eradication of House Rats Rattus rattus and appeared to be restricted to the most inaccessible locations on the island, while subsequently nesting records have been found in areas accessible to researchers (Harvey et al. 2016). House Rats remain present on several islands on which Ashy Storm-petrel has been recorded to breed (e.g. San Clemente and San Miguel), but the current impact is unclear (Carter et al. 2016). Mice Mus musculus are also suspected to depredate eggs and chicks (Ainley et al. 1990 in Angel et al. 2009). Introduced Barn Owls Tyto alba are known to predate upon Ashy Storm-petrels, representing their primary avian predator on Santa Cruz Island in 1995-1996 (McIver 2002); however, depredation by the Barn Owl was less significant in 2005-2007 (McIver et al. 2009). There is strong evidence for the impact of chemical pollution on the Ashy Storm-petrel. In 1992-1997, high levels of organochlorine pollutants, such as DDT and PCBs, were found in Ashy Storm-petrel eggs at Santa Cruz Island (Fry 1994, Carter et al. 2008a,b). This caused extensive eggshell thinning and potentially embryo mortality, leading to low hatching success, averaging 62% on the island between 1995 and 1998. Regulations in 1970 caused a decline in ocean pollutant levels around Santa Cruz Island, implying that the levels of contamination measured in the 1990s were not representative of the historic maximum. By 2008, pollutant levels in eggs on Santa Cruz had decreased (Carter et al. 2008a) and mean hatching success in 2005-2007 was significantly higher than that in 1995-1998 (McIver et al. 2009), similar to the mean seen in the less polluted Fallarones in 1972-1983 (Ainley et al. 1990b). Rising sea levels and increasing storm surge due to climate change is an increasing concern (National Research Council 2012) due to the potential increase in flooding of low-lying nesting habitat in sea caves and offshore rocks during the breeding season. High-water events in 2008, 2010 and 2011 in the Cave of Birds’ Eggs caused low levels of adult and chick mortality, as well as the loss of some areas of cave-floor nesting habitat (McIver et al. 2016). Storm-petrels have been demonstrated to be negatively impacted by the action of chronic and acute oil incidents, with effects extending to reduced reproductive success in the following season. However, most of the impacts do not appear to persist beyond a few years. Breeding populations are not generally suppressed, which may be explained by the recruitment of non-breeding individuals in a species that are limited by breeding sites. They are unlikely to be retrieved dead after an oil spill due to their small size and propensity for being scavenged (ATTC 2001) and, as such, will be underrepresented in counts of this type. The American Trader oil spill is thought to have had some effect on the Ashy Storm-petrel (ATTC 2001). Chronic oiling events do occur within the Ashy Storm-petrel’s range in central California, including the S.S. Jacob Luckenbach, sunk in the Gulf of the Farallones in 1954 and responsible for a number of oiling events since, as well as incidents of illegal offshore dumping of tank washing and bilge dumping (Hampton et al. 2003). The congregation of Ashy Storm-petrel in Monterey Bay in the autumn means major spill in this area would have the potential to affect relatively large numbers of birds (Sydeman et al. 1998). Lights on oil rigs and fishing boats represent a significant source of light pollution, with the entire Ashy Storm-petrel population subject to the impacts of squid boat lights while foraging (McIver et al. 2016), and 37% of the total population exposed to the effects of bright lighting on offshore energy platforms (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2015). This is likely to cause some level of mortality, but the effect on the population is unknown. Disturbance by kayakers also poses a threat to the Ashy Storm-petrel, with the lowest breeding success recorded at sites easily accessible by kayak. Natural and artificial nesting habitats are fragile and prone to movement or collapse if stepped upon. During the breeding season, which coincides with the peak numbers of kayakers, Storm-petrel adults, chicks, and eggs within nest sites are vulnerable to being crushed or disturbed by unaware human visitors (McIver et al. 2011). However, signs preventing tourists from entering caves have been deployed and no evidence of disturbance by the general public has been recorded since (McIver et al. 2011).","The population is estimated to number 5,200-10,000 individuals, equivalent to 3,500-6,700 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Hydrobates homochroa breeds on a small number of island groups and offshore rocks within the California Current System, the northernmost being off Mendocino County, California (U.S.A.) (~39°N) and the southernmost at Los Coronados Islands off northern Baja California, Mexico (~32°N) (Carter et al. 1992 unpublished data, McChesney et al. 2000, Brown et al. 2003, S. Wolf in litt. 2007). Breeding has been confirmed at only six major island groups (South Farallon, San Miguel, Santa Cruz, Santa Barbara, San Clemente, and Los Coronado Islands) and three groups of offshore rocks (Castle Rock/Hurricane Point, Double Point and Bird Rocks) (S. Wolf in litt. 2007). Major colonies, containing the vast majority of the world population, occur on the South Farallon Islands in central California and the Channel Islands in southern California, primarily at Prince Island off San Miguel Island, Santa Barbara Island, and Santa Cruz Island (Carter et al. 1992 unpublished data). Breeding is also suspected at one mainland site in California (Brown et al. 2003). At sea, Ashy Storm-petrels remain within the central and southern California Current System year-round, preferring continental slope waters (200-2000 m deep) that are within a few kilometres of the coast in some areas (e.g. Monterey Bay) and more than 50 km offshore in other areas (e.g. Gulf of the Farallones) (Ainley 1995, Howell and Webb 1995, S. Wolf in litt. 2007). High densities are known to congregate in some areas, e.g. the continental shelf-break in the western Santa Barbara Channel, and in the Santa Cruz Basin that separates Santa Cruz, San Nicolas, and Santa Barbara Islands (Carter et al. 2007). Autumn congregations of 4000-6000 birds have been recorded in Monterey Bay (Ainley 1995). The breeding population has been estimated at 5,200-10,000 individuals (Carter et al. 1992 unpublished data, Ainley 1995), with about half of the population breeding on the South Farallon Islands (Sydeman et al. 1998) and the other half in the Channel Islands (Carter et al. 1992 unpublished data). A study on the South Farallon Islands found declines in breeding birds of 42% in 1972-1992 (Sydeman et al. 1998), equivalent to c.23% in 10 years or 78% over three generations. On Santa Cruz Island, nest-site monitoring during 1995-2006 showed declines in the number of breeding birds at two of five monitored sites (S. Wolf in litt. 2007). Variation in per capita breeding productivity is thought to be related to fluctuating oceanographic conditions (Sydeman et al. 1998), but consistent declines in productivity were noted on Southeast Farallon between 1990 and 2006 (Ainley et al. 1990, S.

Diet It feeds mainly on fish and squid, and less frequently on crustaceans (Cherel and Klages 1998, ACAP 2009). Habitat Breeding It breeds on slopes or cliffs, typically in bare, rocky areas but sometimes in tussock-grass and ferns (Brooke 2004). Foraging range Satellite-tracking of birds from Amsterdam Island has shown that breeding birds forage up to 1,500 km from the colony (Pinaud and Weimerskirch 2007).","Incidental capture by commercial longline fisheries represents a major threat to the species. Estimates suggest that up to 600 birds are killed annually, comprising mainly adults in the winter months and immatures during the summer fishing season (Gales 1998, Weimerskirch and Jouventin 1998). Yellow-nosed Albatross species are killed in pelagic longline fisheries off southern Africa (Ryan et al. 2002), and occasionally in South African trawl fisheries (B. Watkins in litt. 2008). During the breeding season, it comes into contact with tuna longliners in subtropical waters (Weimerskirch and Jouventin 1998), and birds (mostly adult males) have been taken by Patagonian Toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides longliners in the vicinity of the Prince Edward Islands (Ryan and Boix-Hinzen 1999). Skewed sex ratios contributed to reducing the effective population size. The causative agents of avian cholera Pasteurella multocida and Erysipelas Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae are present in the species’ range and pose a potential risk to the population (ACAP 2009). Avian cholera appears to be the cause of the considerably high mortality rates of young chicks that have been recurring erratically but frequently in the population on Amsterdam Island, and has led to dramatic reductions in productivity over the past decade (Weimerskirch 2016). The disease mainly affects young chicks, but adults may also be affected (Weimerskirch 2004). Subsequent declines in certain colonies could be due to dispersal following failed breeding (Rolland et al. 2009). Erysipelas, while widespread, appears to have little impact on the population in comparison with avian cholera (Uhart et al. 2017). On Amsterdam Island, past habitat destruction by introduced cattle has degraded the breeding sites but fencing of cattle has reduced their impact in recent years (ACAP 2009).","The total population is estimated at 41,086 pairs per year, equating to c. 82,000 mature individuals, and perhaps more than 160,000 individuals of all age classes, using the ratios presented by Gales (1998).",Decreasing,"Thalassarche carteri breeds on Amsterdam, Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands, and St Paul Islands (French Southern Territories) and on Prince Edward Island (South Africa). In addition, two breeding pairs were recorded on The Pyramid in 2007. Colonies on Amsterdam Island were estimated at c. 27,000 pairs breeding per year in 2006 (Rolland et al. 2009). In addition, there were an estimated 7,000 pairs on Prince Edward Island in 2008 (Ryan et al. 2009), 7,030 pairs on Crozet Island in 1984 (ACAP 2009), 50 pairs on Kerguelen in 1987 (Weimerskirch and Jouventin 1998) and six pairs on St Paul in 2005, totalling 41,086 pairs per year, equating to c. 82,000 mature individuals, and perhaps more than 160,000 individuals of all age classes (Gales 1998). Colonies on Amsterdam Island declined on average by 58% between 1982 and 1995. The lowest numbers were recorded in 1995, after which some colonies on the island increased or stabilised between 1996 and 2005. The overall trend on Amsterdam is a decline of over 30% between 1982-2006 (Rolland et al. 2009). The population on Prince Edward appears stable: in 2001-2002, 4,170 pairs were counted, representing 7,500 pairs in total once early breeding failures were taken into account (Ryan et al. 2003). However, the figure for Prince Edward Island was recently revised to 7,000 pairs in 2008 (Ryan et al. 2009).  Decline over three generations is estimated at 51%, assuming a continuing decline on Amsterdam Island and populations elsewhere remaining stable. Outside the breeding season, the species disperses throughout the southern Indian Ocean between 30-50 degrees South, and birds are frequently observed off southern Africa and south-western Australia, extending east to the Tasman Sea and north-eastern New Zealand (Harrison 1985). ","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayACAP Annex 1. Population monitoring and foraging studies have been undertaken at Amsterdam Island. The Prince Edward Islands are a Special Nature Reserve. Vaccination has been tested, but cannot be carried out at a large scale (Weimerskirch 2004). In 2006, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission adopted a measure to require tuna longline fishing vessels to use a bird streamer line when fishing south of 30 degrees South. South Africa requires its longline vessels to use a range of mitigation measures. Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor trends at breeding localities, notably Amsterdam, Prince Edward and Crozet Islands. Conduct further research to explore potential for controlling and limiting impact of disease. Conduct further studies of foraging range and interaction with fisheries.

The effect of invasive species as well as of small-scale and industrial fisheries on the population is not known. The species may warrant uplisting to a higher threat category when more data on its population size and trends are acquired.,"Arriving at colonies in late February to March after an absence of some three months, the birds nest in hollows in cliffs and offshore rocks, and under large boulders (Murphy 1924, Hazevoet 1995). Its diet is composed mostly by Clupeidae (Sardinella maderensis), squid (Loligo sp.) and Carangidae (Selar crumenophthalmus) (Rodrigues 2014).","The species has been harvested for a long time, mostly on Raso and Branco, probably for several centuries (Murphy 1924, P. Donald in litt. 2003, C. Hazevoet in litt. 2003). Eighty years ago, ornithologists recorded 'boat-loads' of this species being taken by fishermen for consumption (Murphy 1924). In 2001, at least 500 chicks were taken on Raso in a single day (P. Donald in litt. 2003) and the remains of several thousand shearwaters have been found on Branco, which were probably accumulated over many years (C. Hazevoet in litt. 2003). The people behind Biosfera I (Environmental Association based in Cape Verde) have recently been quite successful in preventing the traditional October raids of nestlings of Cape Verde Shearwater on Raso by fishermen from Santo Antão (Hazevoet 2003). The species is also at risk from predation by invasive feral cats Felis catus (Nunes and Hazevoet 2001), bycatch in artisanal fisheries off the coast of Cape Verde as well as in industrial fleets operating on the African shelf.","A full island survey during the 2015 breeding season resulted in 6,312 breeding pairs counted on Raso and a further 3,500 birds on Branco (Biosfera unpubl. data). This is equivalent to c.24,000 individuals in total.",Decreasing,"Calonectris edwardsii has been split from Cory's Shearwater C. diomedea (Bretagnolle and Lequette 1990, Hazevoet 1995, Porter et al. 1997). It is considered locally common in Cape Verde (Hazevoet 1995), with large numbers frequently seen off the island of Raso (P. Donald in litt. 2003, C. Hazevoet in litt. 2003). The largest colonies are on Raso, Branco and Brava. Breeding is sparse on Santiago, São Nicolau and Santo Antão (C. Hazevoet in litt. 2003). The total population has been estimated to number c. 10,000 pairs since 1988-1993 (Hazevoet 1995, Nunes and Hazevoet 2001). Raso and Branco together hold the majority of the population, with 5,000-7,500 pairs estimated in 1988-1993 (Hazevoet 1995). A full island survey during the 2015 breeding season resulted in 6,312 breeding pairs counted on Raso and further 3,500 birds on Branco (Biosfera unpubl. data).During incubation, birds mostly target a discrete region off West Africa (off Dakar, Senegal), foraging over the shelf and shelf break of the African continent (Paiva et al. 2015). When rearing chicks, birds mostly forage within the surroundings of the colony, exploiting shallower areas within the Cape Verde Islands, with very few trips towards the African coast (Paiva et al. 2015). Individuals winter between the Brazil and Falklands Current, off the coast of southern Brazil and Uruguay (González-Solís et al. 2009).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is protected by law and unauthorised entrance to both Raso and Branco is officially illegal, but there is no real control (C. Hazevoet in litt. 2003). In 1991, the government declared Santa Luzia, Branco, Raso, Cima, Curral Velho and Baluarte as natural reserves (Nunes and Hazevoet 2001). However, the regulation of human activities has not been published and no wardening has been put in place (Nunes and Hazevoet 2001).Conservation Actions ProposedRe-assess the population size to acquire an up-to-date estimate. Monitor the harvest of the species. Employ wardens in protected areas to control human activities and enforce existing legislation (Nunes and Hazevoet 2001).

The population trend is difficult to determine however the population is not believed to be declining sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Pelagic movements are easily divided into frequent foraging trips around the breeding areas, rapid long-distance migrations, and smaller-scale movements within a well defined wintering ground (González-Solís et al. 2009). Breeding starts in April on barren offshore islands, where breeding pairs occupy cliffs, caves and boulder fields (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding individuals in the Canary Islands show a unimodal foraging strategy, concentrating on highly productive regions of the African continental shelf (Navarro and González-Solís 2009). Diet is mostly squid, which are obtained mainly by surface-seizing. The species is regularly attracted to trawlers to feed on offal (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","The primary threats to this species include interaction with small- (and large-) scale fisheries, and predation by invasive, non-native species. Together with C. diomedea, it is the main seabird species caught as bycatch by the Spanish longline fleet in the western Mediterranean (Báez et al. 2014). A study by Ramos et al. (2012), utilising long-term capture-recapture data and year-round tracking data for birds on Selvagem Grande, suggests that incidental bycatch by longline fisheries contributes to a decrease in adult survival probability during the breeding season. The species may also suffer the impacts of bycatch in its non-breeding range (e.g. Granadeiro et al. 2006). In addition, fledglings suffer direct persecution on the Canary Islands, with negative effects on breeding success (Lopez-Darias et al. 2011), and c. 500-1,500 chicks poached annually on the Azores (Fontaine et al. 2011). A range of invasive predators are present in the species’ range, but their impacts have largely been unaccounted for. The effect of rats on the species not fully understood. In some colonies a high abundance of rats has been shown to have significant negative effects on reproductive success, while in others the opposite effect has been found and is attributed to the rats providing an alternative food source for cats, thereby reducing pressure on chicks (Thibault 2005). Pascal et al. (2008) found a substantial difference in breeding success of Cory’s Shearwaters in areas with (0.82%) and without (0.45%) rat control (see also Thibault 1995). Feral cats Felis catus predate large numbers of juveniles and chicks in colonies on the Azores and Madeira, however the impact on breeding success has not been comprehensively assessed (Hervias et al. 2013). Predation of eggs and chicks by House Mice Mus musculus is thought to cause slow but significant reductions in breeding success in parts of the range (Hervias et al. 2013). In one colony, chicks are predated by Madeiran Wall Lizards Teira dugessii which have been recorded in up to 10% of nests, but no overall impact on breeding success has been found (Matias et al. 2009). Lizard predation appears to be a local phenomenon and is highly unlikely to have an impact on the species on a population level. Light pollution, and consequent grounding, predominantly of immature individuals, is another threat contributing to the slow, steady decline of the species across its range (Fontaine et al. 2011).","The European population is estimated at 252,000-253,000 pairs, which equates to 504,000-507,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"This species breeds in the Azores and Madeira (&gt;85% of the global population, plus a few pairs on the Berlengas Islands off the Portuguese mainland), Portugal, and on the Canary Islands, Spain (c.15% of the global population [Granadeiro et al. 2006, Derhé 2012]). The vast majority of the population spends the non-breeding season in the Atlantic.A population recovery is reported for Selvagem Grande (Savage Islands, Madeira archipelago), the largest colony of Cory's Shearwaters in the world, with an estimated increase of 4.6% per year since 1980 (Granadeiro et al. 2006). This follows a series of mass culling events in the 1970s, carried out by Portuguese and Spanish fishermen, which reduced the colony by c.90% from c.140,000 pairs. Since 1977, strict protection has been enforced and the population started a steady recovery; however, between 1995 and 1998 a decline of more than 13% was reported, before monitoring work was interrupted. Following fieldwork in 2005, the colony was estimated to number c.30,000 pairs (Granadeiro et al. 2006), which implies an overall decline of c.110,000 pairs since the mid-20th century. Following the surveys in 2005, it was estimated that assuming an annual growth rate of 5%, it would take another 35 years for the colony to reach its numbers prior to the culling events (Granadeiro et al. 2006). The largest colony in the Azores is on the island of Corvo, where the latest population estimate was &gt;6,000 pairs (3,735-10,524) in 2012; however, the colony may have been much larger in the past (Oppel et al. 2014).The population trend is difficult to determine owing to gaps in the data, and is therefore considered unknown according to the European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015). The population in the Azores was reported to be stable between 2001 and 2012 (BirdLife International 2015). However, rapid declines have been reported in the Azores (43% decline during 1996-2001; Bolton 2001) which may be caused by inter-annual variation in colony attendance (Jenouvrier et al. 2005), along with behavioural differences between census years (Bolton 2001, Fontaine et al. 2011). The taxon has been listed as Vulnerable at the national level in Spain, owing to an estimated and projected decline of at least 30% over three generations (Lorenzo 2004).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe following information refers to the species's European range only: In Europe, most important breeding areas are in protected areas (Madroño et al. 2004, Cabral 2005). In Spain, sporadic counts of breeding populations occur in some colonies, mostly in the Balearic Islands, but in the Columbretes counts are more regular. Reproductive success is also monitored in the Chafarinas (Madroño et al. 2004). A study of the incidental mortality of seabirds in waters around the Columbretes Islands (SEO/BirdLife, General Secretariat of Fisheries) found high numbers of this species were killed by longline fisheries; however, mortality could be reduced by avoiding setting lines around sunrise and sunset (Belda and Sanchez 2001). Research projects and awareness campaigns, some of which were financed through the LIFE Programme have taken place in Portugal (Cabral 2005).Conservation Actions ProposedThe following information refers to the species's European range only: Adequate protection (e.g. through SPAs) of all breeding areas, both current and historical, should be ensured. Actively managing the breeding colonies (eliminating predators, recreating the breeding habitat) and removing predators from the former breeding colonies to promote the natural return of the species, will also help secure the species. The proper use of corrective measures in longline fisheries to avoid accidental capture of birds should be promoted and specific corrective measures to prevent accidental capture of the species in longline fisheries should be developed, in collaboration with the fishing industry. Marine areas which are important for the conservation of the species should be designated SPAs. Assessments of the environmental impact of new developments and activities that are planned need to be established. National censuses of this species should be conducted and breeding colonies monitored to determine accurate population trends. Water sports in the vicinity of breeding colonies should be regulated, especially at night, in order to avoid disturbing the birds. The regulation of artificial lighting in the breeding areas and adjacent coastal areas is important to minimize their impact particularly on young birds at the time of fledging (Madroño et al. 2004).",Afrotropical|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Its diet is comprised mostly of fish, causing great congregations in areas with abundant prey. Prey species include sardines and anchovies, but has been seem to take shrimps and carrion, and even nestling egrets. It regularly feeds by plunge-diving and is often the victim of kleptoparasites. The timing of breeding varies depending on latitude, breeding in spring in the extreme north of its range compared to all year round in the tropics. Brown Pelicans are colonial, with some colonies being maintained over several years. It mostly nests on the ground, sometimes on cliffs and less often in small trees or bushes. Movements and migrations depend on local conditions (e.g. northern populations migrate south) (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","This species is highly sensitive to organochlorine pesticides (Blus 1982). In the past, bioaccumulation of DDT in the marine environment severely impaired the species’ reproductive success through eggshell thinning and breakage (Blus 1982, 1984) and increased adult mortality (Keith et al. 1971). Following the ban on general use of DDT in the US (Environmental Protection Agency 1972), eggshell thickness, productivity and population sizes increased (Mendenhall and Prouty 1978, Blus 1982).Ongoing threats include injuries caused by entanglement in fishing hooks and lines (Hanson et al. 2014), the collapse of sardine populations along the west coast of America, unintentional disturbance from tourists of birds in breeding colonies, as well as intentional disturbance from fishermen (Elliott et al. 2018). There is evidence for human disturbance causing reduced breeding success in colonies nesting in the Gulf of California (Anderson and Keith 1980), Mexico (Anderson 1988) and Costa Rica (Stiles 1984).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is highly migratory (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992) and breeds from mid-May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) in solitary pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005), with neighbouring nests as close as 3 m apart (Snow and Perrins 1998). It occasionally nests in association with gull or tern colonies (Kear 2005). Non-breeding birds spend the breeding season in flocks on open water (Flint et al. 1984). After breeding (from June onwards [Scott and Rose 1996]) the adults migrate to moulting sites (males travelling and moulting before the females) (Madge and Burn 1988), where they become flightless for 3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996). When moulting and overwintering the species is highly sociable and can occur in large flocks (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996) of several thousands of individuals (Scott and Rose 1996), although it is more common in small scattered groups of c.100 individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species mainly forages by diving and may feed at depths of 30-40 m during the winter (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on wooded coastlines (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005), small freshwater lakes (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005), pools and rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998) in northern coniferous forests (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005), wooded Arctic tundra (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) and alpine zones (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005); especially where there are boulder-covered or small rocky islands available for nesting with extensive herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and low trees (Johnsgard 1978, Kear 2005). Non-breeding The majority winter at sea on shallow inshore coastal waters (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992), especially in estuaries or inlets where there are large mussel-beds (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also occur on freshwater lakes and estuaries during migration (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, as well as crustaceans, worms, echinoderms (del Hoyo et al. 1992), amphipods, isopods (Kear 2005), small fish, and (in freshwater habitats) adult and larval insects (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species may also consume plant material on its breeding grounds (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (e.g. leaves and shoots) (Flint et al. 1984). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression positioned on the ground (del Hoyo et al. 1992) in tall grass, among hummocks or under bushes (Flint et al. 1984), usually within 100 m of open water (occasionally up to 2-3 km away) (Kear 2005).","Hunting poses a significant threat to the species, with an estimated harvest of 6,000 – 14,000 individuals in the 10-year period from 2004-2014 in US and Canada, but with a downward trend (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2015). A recent estimate suggests that the harvest of White-winged Scoters may be 29-37% over the maximum sustainable rate (Koneff et al. 2017). The species feeds at depths of 30–40 m and is therefore highly susceptible to bycatch in fishing nets, as documented by Good et al. (2009) in the Salient Sea, Washington. Moulting and wintering populations are also vulnerable to oil spills as they often occur in high densities in close proximity to oil transportation routes. One catastrophic spill could impact a large proportion of the population. Oil pollution can also cause the long-term disruption of food supplies which may have more serious effects on populations in the long-term than direct mortality from oiling. Lance (2001) documented evidence for a long-term negative effect as a result of the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident. The disturbance and habitat degradation caused by increasing levels of oil and gas exploration in the Arctic will likely have only minor or negligible impacts on this species (Poland et al. 2003, Henderson and Loe 2014). In some locations in the Pacific Northwest, sea ducks could be exposed to toxicologically significant levels of cadmium associated with mussels foraged from aquaculture structures, which raises the possibility that such exposure could be contributing to observed population declines (Bendell 2011). Climate change is an additional threat, with remote sensing showing the shrinkage of ponds in subarctic Alaska (Riordan et al. 2006), with these wetlands providing important breeding grounds for the species at present. In general, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region (Fox et al. 2015). Decreasing spring snow cover duration in boreal regions has been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch, projected to cause a 31.0% population decline between 1980 and 2080 (Drever et al. 2011). Ocean acidification may lead to declines in molluscs which form a large part of White-winged Scoter diet (Steinacher et al. 2009, del Hoyo et al. 2017).","There is apparently no reliable estimate of this species's total population, and further research is needed.",Decreasing,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It occupies a very small range on only one island when breeding and is susceptible to human impacts, introduced species and stochastic events, which could drive the species towards extinction in a very short time.","The species breeds at 80-300 m, usually in burrows excavated in the soil, although nests can also be found in rock crevices in areas where soil is not present (D. Menezes and P. Oliveira in litt. 2007). Birds return to their breeding grounds in early June. Incubation occurs between mid-July and mid-August and juveniles fledge throughout November-December (D. Menezes and P. Oliveira in litt. 2007, Ramírez et al. 2013, Ramos et al. 2016). ","The main threat to the species is the loss of burrows and nesting birds to severe storms and subsequent erosion, which are occurring with increasing frequency. However, only a proportion of the colony has previously been affected and this has caused only minor short-term population impacts, suggesting that non-breeders likely buffer the population to a degree. Predation and disturbance by Yellow-legged Gulls Larus michahellis are potential threats on Bugio. Historically, the species has been predated by invasive feral cats and its breeding sites have been affected by habitat degradation caused by introduced goats, rabbits and mice (D. Menezes and P. Oliveira in litt. 2007). These threats were targeted through EU-funds during the period 2006-2010 (LIFE06 NAT/P/000184) and have been monitored since then. These invasive species have not been recorded in the breeding plateau since 2008 (D. Menezes pers. comm. 2016, F. Zino pers. comm. 2016).

The tracking of a total of 43 individuals between 2007 and 2013 has cast light on the species’s non-breeding distribution. Individuals remain in the North Atlantic during the pre-laying exodus, incubation and chick-rearing periods, and winter in five areas: two off the Brazilian coast, one around the Cape Verde archipelago, one off the south-eastern coast of the U.S.A., and one in pelagic waters in the central South Atlantic (Ramírez et al. 2013, 2015).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayA European action plan was published in 1996 (Zino et al. 1996) and its implementation reviewed in 2010 (Barov and Derhé 2011). Since 2006, an eradication programme for rabbits and mice has been in force; it is believed that these species may not longer inhabit Bugio Island, yet no official communication has been made by Natural Park Authorities, so the island is not yet declared alien-free (I. Ramírez pers. comm. 2016). The threat from Larus michahellis is being monitored (D. Menezes and P. Oliveira in litt. 2007). Natural vegetation replanting, together with  anti-erosion blankets and building of artificial nests were all part of a successful EU-funded project (2006-2010, LIFE06 NAT/P/000184). Wardening and monitoring have since been in place on Bugio’s south plateau (Menezes 2007, Menezes et al. 2011), yet an increase in the monitoring effort of both natural and artificial nests is yet needed. Geolocators are being attached to breeding individuals from 2007 onward on a yearly basis to investigate foraging ecology (Ramirez et al. 2013, Ramírez et al. 2015, Ramos et al. 2016). In 2016, GPS-loggers were also fitted to some breeding individuals (I. Ramírez pers.comm.). Monitoring of the species is carried out by staff from the Madeiran Natural Park and other researchers, although such work requires great efforts, as the southern plateau of Bugio is extremely remote (I. Ramirez in litt. 2014).Conservation Actions ProposedConduct coordinated surveys to obtain an up-to-date estimate for the total breeding population. Continue annual surveys to monitor population trends, adult survival and breeding success. Increase efforts to monitor soil erosion and continue to build/replace artificial nests. Refine the characterisation of the at-sea distribution of the species, using high-resolution tracking devices. Continue monitoring measures against rabbits and mice.

Cats caused a rapid decline in the species on Marion Island prior to their eradication in 1991 (Cooper et al. 1995). Despite cat eradication, subsequent recovery on Marion has been slower than expected, possibly due to breeding success remaining unexpectedly low.

It breeds on oceanic islands and rocky offshore islets, occupying cliffs and earthy slopes, usually with little more than herbaceous vegetation, or amongst rocks. In the north-east Atlantic, it breeds mainly late February to March (Carboneras et al. 2014). It breeds from late January. Birds from the Salvages (Madeira) arrive at colonies in July. The species is colonial, often nesting at low densities and in small numbers, sometimes in mixed colonies with other species, for example Calonectris diomedea, which out-competes the present species for burrows in the Azores (Monteiro et al. 1996). It nests in rock crevices or self-excavated burrows. The clutch is a single egg. It feeds mainly on fish, squid and crustaceans. Little is known about the species’s movements. Adults are thought to be largely sedentary, while immatures are probably more dispersive (Carboneras et al. 2014).","Introduced House Rats Rattus rattus pose a considerable threat to this species, as demonstrated by the increased breeding success (from 0 to 85-90%) following rat control programmes on the Sainte-Anne Islets, French West Indies (Pascal et al. 2003). The species is also vulnerable to human disturbance and developments. Habitat destruction may have been responsible for some local extinctions and near-extinctions. Mortality from attraction to artificial lights and subsequent grounding has been reported on the Canary Islands (Carboneras et al. 2014). Other potential threats include marine pollution, harvesting for consumption, bycatch by fisheries, development for tourism and recreational activities (Madroño et al. 2004).","The nominate subspecies has been estimated to number 7,400-20,500 pairs (Mackin 2016), with subspecies boydi estimated at 5,000 pairs on the Cape Verde Islands, and subspecies baroli numbering 895-1,741 pairs on the Azores (BirdLife International 2015), c.1,642 pairs in the Madeira region (BirdLife International 2015) (most recent estimate of c.300 pairs in the Desertas Islands, 1,500-2,200 in the Savage Islands [reviewed by Brooke 2004]) and c.400 pairs and declining in the Canary Islands (Rodríguez et al. 2012, BirdLife International 2015).

If it is found to be breeding at more than five locations, the species may warrant downlisting to a lower threat category.","It nests on steep sea-slopes, canyons and cliffs with a sparse cover of herbaceous and shrubby plants (Drost and Lewis 1995). It is a generalist predator, and may exploit higher prey concentrations around pelagic convergence lines (Hamilton et al. 2004). Nesting persists through mid-June with peak nesting from late March to late April (Jones et al. 2005). Clutches consist of two eggs laid approximately eight days apart with replacement of lost clutches unusual. Incubation takes c. 34 days (Jones et al. 2005).","Invasive mammalian predators represent the most important threat to this species. Historically, cats Felis catus are thought to have extirpated Murrelets from several islands and is currently a significant barrier to recolonization and recovery (Keitt 2005, B. Tershy in litt. 2007). Cats likely extirpated, or at the very least, significantly reduced the population on the main island of Guadalupe (B. Tershy in litt. 2007). Substantial numbers of cat-killed Murrelet cadavers have been identified on Baja California islands (Keitt 2005). Introduced House Rats Rattus rattus represent another major threat; in 2002, 96% of artificial nests were depredated on control islands (rats present) with rats accounting for most of the predation, Nest predation on the treatment island (rats eradicated) was significantly lower with only 8% of artificial nests depredated, mostly by endemic Deer Mice Peromyscus maniculatus (Jones et al. 2005). Predation levels by Deer Mice appear to be low enough to not have any significant impact on the species (USFW 2016). In 2003, following rat eradication on the remaining islands (Middle and West Anacapa Islets), nest predation was reduced from 96% in 2002 to 3% in 2003 (note: these studies were done on Xantus' Murrelet Synthliboramphus hypoleucus scrippsi which is commonly lumped with Guadalupe Murrelet [Nettleship and Kirwan 2018] and, although it is not confirmed whether the Guadalupe Murrelet breeds on the studied islands, impacts are likely comparable). Alcids appear to be extremely susceptible to oiling and often comprise the bulk of seabird mortality from oil spills in western North America. The threat of oil pollution to (Xantus’) Murrelets in the Southern California Bight has risen substantially since the early 1960s with increased oil tanker traffic. From 1963 to 1989, 35 offshore oil platforms were built in federal and state waters (eight of which were removed between 1974 and 1996). Examples of past oil spills within the species’ range include the 1986 Apex Houston barge oil spill and the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill. In addition to direct mortality from oiling, the species is at risk from chronic oil contamination, with high chronic oiling of seabirds occurring in the Santa Barbara Channel and in offshore waters off central and southern California (Carter et al. 2000). At present, organochlorine pollutants are considered not to have a significant effect on (Scripps’) Murrelets breeding at Catalina, but may have caused reduced reproduction or population size in the past, especially between the 1940s and 1970s, prior to the end of production and dumping of DDT in southern California waters (Drost and Lewis 1995, Whitworth et al. 2014). Compared to pre-1947 conditions, recent studies of (Xantus’) Murrelet eggs collected in 1992 have shown low levels of egg-shell thinning (i.e. 1.5%) and pollutants (i.e. 0.86 ppm total DDT, 0.35 ppm total PCB), compared to other seabird species (Burger and Fry 1993, Kiff 1994). Current effects from organochlorine pollution on related species of Murrelets appear to be low (Carter et al. 2000). Climate change and bycatch mortality may pose additional risks to the population, but are apparently not driving any significant declines at present. Temperature extremes may impact the species through food resource loss in El Niño years, however impacts on Synthliboramphus spp. appear modest due to their generalist prey (USFWS 2016). Gill-net fisheries are well known for incidental bycatch of alcids (Nettleship et al. 1984, DeGange et al. 1993) and entanglement in gill-nets may kill small numbers of Murrelets in the Southern California Bight, but is unlikely to be causing significant mortality levels (Carter et al. 2000). Bycatch was considered to currently operate at a very low impact level on Guadalupe Murrelet (USFWS 2016), and most is likely to occur in small-scale gill-net fisheries.","It is estimated to number fewer than 5,000 breeding birds (Birt et al. 2012), which are presumed to form one sub-population. Until further data are obtained, an estimate of 5,000 mature individuals is used in this assessment, which is assumed here to equate to c.7,500 individuals in total.",Decreasing,"Synthliboramphus hypoleucus breeds along the west coast of Mexico, on the three San Benito Islands, Guadalupe Island and at least two associated offshore rocks (Birt et al. 2012, Chesser et al. 2012). Cat predation is thought to have caused the extirpation, or at the very least, significantly reduced the population on the main island of Guadalupe (Keitt et al. 2006), which is considered the most important historical site for the species (B. Tershy in litt. 2007). Other likely former breeding colonies (Cedros, Natividad, Asunción and San Roque) are thought to have been extirpated by invasive animals (B. Keitt and D. Whitworth in litt. 2003). Breeding is unconfirmed on San Martín Island, Baja California, and San Clemente and Santa Barbara islands, California (Chesser et al. 2012). The species winters offshore, with presumably the majority of the population remaining in the vicinity of the breeding range along the western coast of Baja California (Chesser et al. 2012). Some post-breeding birds disperse north to the coasts of California and Oregon, U.S.A. (Gaston and Jones 1998).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe most important remaining conservation action is to eradicate cats from Guadalupe Island. Guadalupe Island has been declared a Biosphere Reserve (thanks to Conservación de Islas) (B. Tershy in litt. 1999).

It mainly feeds on fish, which it catches by pursuit-diving, and sometimes fishing co-operatively forming large aggregations. Laying occurs mainly from March to July, with individuals forming colonies sometimes alongside other seabirds. It nests on rocks, islands and sandy beaches, usually on slopes, headlands and cliff tops (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","Dramatic reductions in productivity following climatic extremes, suggest high vulnerability to climate change. The largest sub-colony on Alcatraz Island (Laundry Building) has been monitored since 1995, and the two worst years on record were 2009 (total breeding failure) and 2010 (0.5 chick fledged per pair). High air temperatures in 2008, poor ocean productivity in 2009 and the El Niño event in 2010 are proposed explanations. After these three unfavourable years, the 2010 count of 145 nesting pairs amounted to less than half of the peak population size in 2008 (Acosta et al. 2010).Human disturbance from recreational activities in the species's range may have detrimental impacts on the population. Buxton et al. (2017) showed that visitor noise alters cormorant behaviour and decreases colony attendance, particularly in the presence of nest predating gulls.","The population is estimated at 230,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"Brandt's Cormorant occupies the Pacific coast of North America, ranging from south-east Alaska (U.S.A.) to Baja California (Mexico) (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

It favours willow (Salix) mires with small creeks, sedge (Carex) marshes and peat mounds, both above the treeline and within mountain birch (Betula) forest (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Egg-laying occurs from early to mid-June or July in the north of the range and from the end of May in the south (Tyler 2018). The nest is built by the female, although the initial hollow is made by the male and both sexes bring material. The nest consists of a cup of grass leaves and stems, some moss and dead leaves at the base, lined with finer grass, hair and feathers, and is sited on the ground on a hummock or bank. Sometimes it is placed at the end of a short tunnel. Clutch size varies between two and seven eggs, but usually five or six. The species forages on the ground. It mainly feeds on insects, but also on other invertebrates and some vegetable matter (Tyler 2018). The species is migratory. European populations mostly winter in sub-Saharan Africa, but scattered wintering sites exist in south-east Italy, Turkey and North Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). Eastern populations migrate mainly to south-east Asia, south-east China and Taiwan (China) (Tyler 2018).","The species's distribution in Finland contracted markedly between 1974-1978 and 1986-1989 and disappeared from Finnish Lapland, but the reasons for this decline are unknown (Tyler 2018).

It is also often found in towns and villages. It mostly breeds from early April to August, starting later in the north. The species is monogamous. Both sexes build the nest, which is a rough cup of twigs, grass stems, leaves, rootlets and mosses, lined with hair, wool or feathers. It is placed in a hole or crevice in a riverbank, wall or bridge. White Wagtail also often nests in buildings or even in machinery. Clutches consist of three to eight eggs. The species feeds on a wide range of small terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, as well as fish fry, crumbs and other household scraps.

It requires cavity nest-sites, typically in woodland or on man-made structures, close to open areas of short grassland for foraging. At other times, it exploits a wide range of habitats, including moorland, saltmarshes, seashore and tidal flats, stubble fields, orchards, refuse dumps and sewage-treatment works. It roosts in reedbeds, scrub and trees, as well as bridges and buildings and even in town centres. Breeding occurs mostly between March and July. The nest is a bulky structure of dry grass, conifer needles, twigs, string and other materials and the cup is lined with softer materials such as grass, feathers, moss, wool, hair and paper, fresh green leaves and flowers. It is typically built in a hole in a tree, cliff, building or other structure and nestboxes are also readily used. Clutches normally consist of four to six eggs (Craig and Feare 2015). Common Starling is omnivorous, taking animal and plant material all year round, but during the spring animal food predominates and is fed almost exclusively to nestlings (Snow and Perrins 1998). The northern and eastern populations are migratory, whereas southern and western populations as well as those in urban areas tend to be resident (Craig and Feare 2015).","The species is thought to be declining in some areas owing to the intensification and specialization of agriculture and subsequent changes in rural habitats (Craig and Feare 2015), such as decreases in fallow and grassland and increases in autumn-sown arable crops (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).

It breeds in ecotone habitats between forests and plain or open areas at the tree-line, including wooded tundra, mountain steppe, subalpine scrub, marshland with low woody cover, clumps of willow (Salix), alder (Alnus) and birch (Betula) on floodplains, riverbank thickets, reedy and shrub-dominated lakeshores, bushy sites near water. The breeding season lasts from late April to July in central Europe, from late May in Scandinavia, early April to June in Armenia, June to July in Ladakh, May to July in China and May/June to August in North America. The nest is a deep cup of leaves, small twigs, dry grass, rootlets, plant down and moss, which is occasionally lined with animal hair. It is placed among grass and scrub on wet ground and is commonly associated with topographic features such as a hummock, gulley, lip of a bank, or tussock. Clutches consist of four to seven eggs. The diet is principally invertebrates, particularly insects, but it does take some seeds and fruit in the autumn (Collar 2015). The species is mainly migratory, with west Palearctic populations wintering in patches across the Mediterranean Basin and the northern Afrotropics and eastern populations in the Indian subcontinent (Snow and Perrins 1998).","In Europe, Bluethroat experiences pronounced, but largely unexplained, population fluctuations (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Collar 2015). Some negative trends appear to be explained by natural succession in marshland, drainage and management practices such as reed-cutting, seedling removal and cattle grazing (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), but recovery has taken place without the reversal of these circumstances. In Spain, during the 1990s Bluethroat may have suffered from degradation of habitat through grazing. In Austria, significant losses occurred during the 19th century due to drainage. Now, the species faces threats there due to the stabilization of lake levels and the subsequent loss of the reed-belt, as well as due to the occupation of secondary habitats on arable land and subsequent elevated nest predation (Collar 2015).","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number 4,460,000-7,760,000 pairs, which equates to 8,930,000-15,500,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Europe forms approximately 25% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 35,720,000-62,000,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

It prefers open country, such as farmland where buildings provide nesting sites and where water is nearby. It is primarily a rural species in Europe and North America, whilst in north Africa and Asia it often breeds in towns and cities (Turner and Christie 2012). In Europe, it is superseded by the House Martin (Delichon urbicum) in urban areas (Turner and Rose 1989). The breeding season lasts from May to August. The nest is built by both sexes and is a cup or half-cup, made from mud pellets mixed with fibres such as dry grass, straw and horsehair and lined with dry grass and white feathers. Originally, nests were built in caves or on cliffs, but now almost always on artificial structures. Clutches consist of two to seven eggs (Turner and Christie 2012). Barn Swallow feeds almost entirely on flying insects (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is migratory, with European birds wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997), although some individuals winter in southern and western Europe (Snow and Perrins 1998). Birds breeding in North America winter in South America, whilst birds breeding in East Asia winter in South Asia (Turner and Christie 2012).","The main threat to the species is the intensification of agriculture. Changes in farming practices, such as the abandonment of traditional milk and beef production, have resulted in a loss of suitable foraging areas. In addition, intensive livestock rearing, land drainage and the use of herbicides and pesticides all reduce the numbers of insect prey available. Suitable nest sites are often scarcer on modern farms. The species is susceptible to changes in climate, with bad weather in the wintering areas as well as the breeding grounds affecting breeding success (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is occasionally hunted for sport, and nests are sometimes removed as a nuisance. In North America, introduced House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) are serious nest-site competitors, taking over nests and destroying eggs and nestlings (Turner and Christie 2012).","The European population is estimated at 29-48.7 million pairs, which equates to 58-97.4 million mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). Europe forms approximately 20% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 290-487 million mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. National population estimates include: 10,000-1 million breeding pairs and &gt;1,000 individuals on migration in China; 10,000-100,000 breeding pairs, &gt;10,000 individuals on migration and &lt;50 wintering individuals in Taiwan; 10,000-1 million breeding pairs and &gt;1,000 individuals on migration in Korea; 10,000-1 million breeding pairs, &gt;1,000 individuals on migration and 50-1,000 wintering individuals in Japan, as well as 10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and 1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayBern Convention Appendix II.

In particular, this requires extensive livestock rearing, a reduction in pesticide use and the preservation of wetland areas and waterbodies (Tucker and Heath 1994). Nesting can be encouraged by providing wooden ledges or artificial nest cups made of cement and sawdust or papier maché (Turner and Christie 2012).

Throughout its range, it prefers mainly barren terrain with very short vegetation. In Eurasia, it breeds mainly in arctic tundra, dry stony patches in lichen tundra, barren steppes and arctic-alpine zones. It also occupies open coasts and dunes in the non-breeding season. In western Europe, migrants of the subspecies flava are largely confined to open coastal habitats around the North Sea in winter. In North America, Horned Lark is widely distributed across most open habitats from sea-level up to c.4,000 m. In the Andes, the subspecies peregrina uses short-grass pastureland and bare fields to at least 3,100 m. In Eurasia, Horned Lark breeds from late May to mid-July in Scandinavia, but from mid-June in Arctic Russia. In North America, it breeds from mid-February in southern USA and from mid-May in the Canadian Arctic. The female builds the nest in an excavated cavity or natural depression on the ground, which is filled with woven plant material, lined with feathers or other fine material and has stones, bark, clods of earth, animal dung and other materials placed around it. The nest is usually positioned to reduce wind flow across it to as little as a tenth of ambient wind speed and to maximize shade. Clutches consist of one to eight eggs, but mostly two to five, although clutch size increases with latitude. Horned Lark feeds on a wide range of invertebrates in summer and plant material in winter. Nestlings are fed almost entirely with invertebrates. The species is migratory or partially migratory in the north and mostly resident or an altitudinal migrant in the south. Across the Holarctic Region, subspecies in the far north are wholly migratory, with much or all of breeding range abandoned in winter. In the south of the range, Horned Lark is an altitudinal migrant (Donald and de Juana 2014).","In Europe, drastic declines were noted since 1950s in northern Fennoscandia, especially Finland, which were believed to be due to overgrazing of lichen by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) (Donald and de Juana 2014). The subspecies peregrina in the Colombian Andes is threatened by the introduced Kikuyu Grass (Cenchrus clandestinus), unfavourable agricultural practices and unrestricted use of pesticides. In North America, changes in agriculture are considered a threat, including the replacement of arable crops by biomass-fuel production and the change from conventional tillage to minimum tillage. Agricultural abandonment and direct poisoning by pesticides are also considered threats (Donald and de Juana 2014).","Partners in Flight estimate the global population to number 140,000,000 mature individuals (A. Panjabi in litt. 2017). The European population is estimated at 2,140,000-6,510,000 pairs, which equates to 4,280,000-13,000,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

It is also nomadic in parts of its wintering range (e.g. southern Africa), moving as habitats flood or are overgrown (Hockey et al. 2005). Autumn movements to wintering grounds occur between July and November; the return migration occurring mid-May to early-June, with breeding occurring between late-June and early-July (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Many immatures also remain in the wintering grounds all year round (del Hoyo et al. 1996). This species is gregarious outside of the breeding season and occurs in small groups in its winter range, often aggregating into larger flocks to roost at high tide or at night (Urban et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998, Hockey et al. 2005). A typical migratory flock can be as large as 20-30 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding pairs sometimes nest as close as 5 pairs/ha, but more often they are dispersed (around 10 pairs/km2) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding During the breeding season this species inhabits low altitude tundra in the high Arctic (although it exceptionally occurs above 1,000 m in the west of its range) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for dry ground among dwarf willows near swampy areas or saltmarshes, or areas where mosses and sedges are interspersed with hummocks covered by Empetrum (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It avoids areas where annual rainfall exceeds 250 mm (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding On migration this species is found along the muddy edges of small inland lakes, reservoirs, sewage farms, riverbanks and seasonal pools, as well as on coastal mudflats and seashores (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). In its winter range the species mainly inhabits coastal areas such as estuarine mudflats and sandflats, enclosed lagoons, tidal creeks and saltpans, but it also occurs at inland freshwater wetlands such as open pools in marshes, paddyfields, jheels (and other small bodies of water covered with vegetation), small dams, floodwater margins and sandbanks along rinvers (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Hockey et al. 2005). Diet The diet of this species consists chiefly of invertebrates (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding During the breeding season larval and adult Diptera and small beetles are the primary foods, particularly the larvae of mosquitoes and craneflies (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the diet becomes more varied, with ants, Hymenoptera, waterbugs, annelids, small molluscs, crustaceans, freshwater mites and plant material being taken as well as Diptera and beetles (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow cup on the ground in the open, sometimes covered with vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).","The species is threatened on the south-east coast of India (Point Calimere) by illegal hunting (bird trapping), reservoir and marshland habitat alteration by salt-industries, and habitat degradation by diminishing rainfall (changing the salt regime) (Balachandran 2006). It is threatened at Walvis Bay in Namibia, a key wetland site in southern Africa, by habitat degradation (e.g. through changes in the flood regime due to road building, and wetland reclamation for suburb and port development), and disturbance from tourism (Wearne and Underhill 2007). This species is also susceptible to avian malaria (Mendes et al. 2005) and avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.","The global population is estimated to number c.1,500,000-1,600,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). This roughly equates to 1,000,000-1,100,000 mature individuals. The European population is estimated at 48,200-76,000 pairs, which equates to 96,400-152,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

It also has a very large estimated population size (1,800,000 to 2,650,000 individuals; Wetlands International 2023), and so does not approach Criteria C or D thresholds. Considering its population trend in North America over three generations (c. 22 years), the data presented in Smith et al. (2023) indicate a rapid decline of c. 70%. This is much steeper than the c. 23% decline reported by the Breeding Bird Survey (Ziolkowski et al. 2022), while numbers recorded by the Christmas Bird Count have remained broadly stable (Meehan et al. 2022). However, all of these North American sources relate to just two of the nine flyway populations globally, and together represent &lt;5% of the global total (Wetlands International 2023). Elsewhere, the three large flyway populations that breed in Iceland, N Europe and W Siberia and winter in Africa are all considered to be stable (van Roomen et al. 2022; Wetlands International 2023). As these three populations together represent c. 90% of the global total, there is no evidence that the population is declining at a rate approaching Criterion A thresholds. Hence, the species continues to warrant listing as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory and travels over land on a broad front utilising few staging areas on route (in autumn no known concentrated staging occurs) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It breeds from May to August (Hayman et al. 1986) either in well-dispersed (Johnsgard 1981) solitary pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996) or in loose groups depending on the topography of the land (Snow and Perrins 1998). The autumn migration occurs from July onwards (Hayman et al. 1986) with the return passage to the breeding grounds occurring chiefly between March and May (Hayman et al. 1986) (non-breeders may also remain on the wintering grounds all year round) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). When not breeding the species usually forages singly or in small groups (del Hoyo et al. 1996), flying in small parties (Johnsgard 1981) or larger flocks on migration (Flint et al. 1984, Snow and Perrins 1998)and roosting communally at night in mangrove trees or in shallow water (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on dry scrub heathland (Snow and Perrins 1998), moss and lichen tundra with stunted bushes (Johnsgard 1981), sedge meadows (Johnsgard 1981), wet moorland (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) and mossy hummock bogs (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984) in open areas, river valleys (del Hoyo et al. 1996), along the shores of tundra lakes (Flint et al. 1984), in birch forest near the Arctic treeline (del Hoyo et al. 1996), burned areas of forest (Flint et al. 1984) and open montane forest (del Hoyo et al. 1996) in the boreal, subarctic and subalpine zones (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It generally avoids extremes of cold and wet, steep slopes, bare rock and gravel expanses or tall dense vegetation (e.g. dense forest) (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding On passage in the autumn and spring the species frequents wetlands, tidal flats (del Hoyo et al. 1996), short-sward wet and dry grasslands (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996), farmland (Hayman et al. 1986) and heathland with Empetrum spp., generally occupying coastal habitats in the winter such as muddy, rocky or sandy beaches (del Hoyo et al. 1996), coral shores (Urban et al. 1986), exposed reefs, tidal mudflats (del Hoyo et al. 1996), sandflats (Urban et al. 1986), mangrove swamps (del Hoyo et al. 1996), tidal marshes (Johnsgard 1981) and lagoons (Urban et al. 1986). Diet When inland on migration and during the breeding season its diet consists of adult and larval insects (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996) (e.g. Coleoptera, Orthoptera and cranefly larvae), spiders, millipedes, earthworms, snails, slugs, seeds, leaves and berries (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (e.g. of ericaceous plants) (Johnsgard 1981). On the coast during the winter the species takes crustaceans (e.g. crabs), molluscs, large polychaete worms and occasionally fish, reptiles or young birds (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) often positioned on hummocks or in short heather or grass (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984) in dry exposed locations (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996) sometimes far from water (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984). When the breeding habitat (e.g. tundra or heathland) is flat and open the species nests in solitary pairs, but where irregular features such as hummocks and tall vegetation patches give more visual isolation the species may nest in loose groups (Snow and Perrins 1998). Management information A study in the Shetland Islands, UK found that when trying to enhance the grazing quality of heathlands by re-seeding (e.g. with high quality grass-seed mixtures) it is better to apply lime, grass-seed and inorganic fertiliser directly to the surface of the ground rather than ploughing and harrowing the ground first, as the latter maintains more natural vegetation hummocks and heather used by the species for nesting (Grant 1992). Re-seeding of heathland with prior ploughing and harrowing may improve feeding conditions for pre-breeding adults however (Grant et al. 1992).","","The estimated population size of this species is quite large, ranging between 1,800,000 to 2,650,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2023).",Decreasing,"The species has a Holarctic breeding range with two disjunct populations. The western population breeds along coastal Alaska, Yukon Territory, and southwestern Alaska and Yukon. The eastern population breeds west and south of Hudson Bay, extending from northern Manitoba to northern Ontario. During summer, they are found sporadically along the Atlantic coast of the United States, from South Carolina to Florida, and along the Pacific coast from British Columbia to southern Chile and the Falkland Islands. In winter, they irregularly occur along the Pacific coast from southern Vancouver Island to Baja California, and along the Atlantic coast from South Carolina to Florida. They also winter in Central and South America, the Caribbean, and extend across the Old World from Europe to Australia, including various islands in between (Skeel and Mallory 2020).","Hunting has been recorded in northern South America and the Caribbean (AFSI 2020) and it is inevitably caught occasionally along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway given high levels of hunting (Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020, Yong et al. 2022).

Adults leave their young in July before they are fully fledged and migrate south to the wintering grounds; juveniles then leave the breeding grounds in early-August (Snow and Perrins 1998). Some individuals also winter in Europe as far north as Britain, breeding between late-May and early-July on returning to the breeding range (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species feeds singly or in groups of up to 30 individuals and migrates singly or in small parties, although between 100 and 250 individuals have been encountered at some European staging sites (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding This species breeds in arctic tundra, shrub tundra and forest tundra along flood-plains, although it avoids extremely cold conditions and exposed coasts (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It is mainly found near coastal inlets, fjords, deltas, rivers or streams from sea level to 250 m, but also occurs up to 1,200 m inland on flat, clear ground with little vegetation, areas covered with short grass and interspersed with patches of scrub, areas with grasses, sedges or Empetrum, and scrub willow or birch thickets with sandy or gravelly stretches (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Both dry and wet areas are used, but habitats with elevated locations such as boulders or buildings are preferred because of their use as song perches (Johnsgard 1981). In Scandinavia the species also breeds near fishing huts and houses, and in industrial workings (Ronka 1996). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species inhabits inland freshwater wetlands such as flood-lands, irrigated fields, sewage farms, densely vegetated wetlands, ditches, muddy marshes and lake edges, and on the coast shows a strong preference for mudflats in sheltered inlets, estuaries and saltmarshes, whilst tending to avoid open and sandy beaches (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet On the breeding grounds and in inland habitats the diet of this species consists primarily of insects and their larvae (especially beetles and Diptera such as craneflies and midges), as well as the occasional plant matter (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). On the coasts the species takes annelids, crustaceans (such as sand fleas) and small molluscs (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow cup on the ground in the open or amongst low vegetation, often at the base of small willows, junipers or other shrubs (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).","This species is threatened by nest predation (Koivula and Ronka 1998, Ronka et al. 2006) from Common Gull Larus canus and Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres (Ronka et al. 2006), as well as from Hooded Crow Corvus corone cornix, weasel Mustela nivalis, American mink Mustela vison and fox Vulpes vulpes in Finland (Ronka 1996). It is also threatened in its Scandinavian breeding range by shrinkage and deterioration of suitable habitats (due to eutrophication and the overgrazing of shore meadows), and by increased human recreational disturbance due to the building up of breeding sites (trampling and disturbance often lead to increased hatchling predation and abandonment of nests) (Ronka 1996). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza and may therefore be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","The global population is estimated to number c.165,000-1,255,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

It consequently qualifies as Endangered.","The species inhabits lush areas in arid lowlands and foothills, especially gallery forest, deciduous woodland and dry, open pine-oak woodland on ridges up to 1,000 m. In central Tamaulipas it has been observed in mixed landscapes of wooded mountain slopes with adjacent mixed scrub, citrus or villages (T. Brush in litt. 2016). Smaller numbers occur in agricultural landscapes with a few large trees. Nests are usually in tree-cavities, with breeding from March-May. Clutches of 2-5 eggs are incubated for 25-31 days (Enkerlin-Hoeflich and Hogan 1997). It is nomadic in winter, with large flocks moving south (and apparently north) and to higher elevations. It feeds largely on the fruits of dominant tree species (Enkerlin-Hoeflich and Hogan 1997).","In 1970-1982, 16,490 birds (mostly nestlings) were legally imported into the USA. Illegal exports from Mexico and a pre-export mortality of &gt;50% equates to 5,000 birds per year (Enkerlin-Hoeflich and Hogan 1997). Trappers damage nests when extracting chicks (sometimes felling entire trees), reducing nest-site availability and leading to permanent site abandonment (Snyder et al. 2000). Many gallery forests have been cleared or degraded, with over 80% of Tamaulipas lowlands cleared for agriculture (especially sorghum) and pasture. Tree cover loss within the range is currently estimated at 7% over three generations (Global Forest Watch 2021). Habitat is now patchily distributed on cattle-ranches, where trapping pressure is greatest (Enkerlin-Hoeflich and Hogan 1997). Urban intensification may also present a threat to this species as despite the establishment of urban populations, removal of dead palms by landscapers could harm the species (K. Berg in litt. 2016), and widespread poaching of chicks from well-known urban nest sites could significantly harm these populations in the future (K. Berg in litt. 2016).","In 1992-1994, estimated densities in one area in Mexico indicated a wild population of 3,000-6,500 birds (E. C. Enkerlin-Hoeflich in litt. 1994). This estimate roughly equates to 2,000-4,300 mature individuals. The population has however declined since, and therefore the value is taken as a maximum. A more up-to-date estimate of the wild population is urgently required.From the spatial spread of observational records (per eBird 2021) it appears that the wild population is concentrated in three areas in north-eastern Mexico. However, particularly during the non-breeding season the species is known to move over large areas, and observational records in the intervening areas suggest that there is connectivity among the population. As such, the species is tentatively assessed as forming only one subpopulation.",Decreasing,"Amazona viridigenalis is locally and seasonally fairly common to common on the Atlantic slope of north-east Mexico (Howell and Webb 1995), mostly in Tamaulipas and San Luis Potosí, with small colonies in extreme north-east Querétaro (A. G. Navarro in litt. 1998). In 1992-1994, densities in one area were estimated at 5.7 individuals/km2, indicating a wild population of 3,000-6,500 birds (E. C. Enkerlin-Hoeflich in litt. 1994, Enkerlin-Hoeflich 1995). This compares with 25.2 individuals/km2 reported in the 1970s (Castro 1976). Based on field surveys and ecological niche models generated with MaxEnt models, the species has lost potentially 57% of their former historical distribution, although records for the species were obtained from Nuevo León, Veracruz, where it had previously been thought to have disappeared (Monterrubio-Rico 2012, Monterrubio-Rico et al. 2016). The population recently established in urban areas of the Lower Rio Grande Valley (Texas), USA, is considered by some to consist of wild birds (T. Brush in litt. 2003). Introduced or feral populations are also established (and mostly increasing) in Florida and California (USA), Puerto Rico (to USA), O'ahu (Hawaii) and several suburban parts of Mexico (Enkerlin-Hoeflich and Hogan 1997, Shaffer 2018).","The species is threatened by trapping and illegal trade.

However, the rate of decline in the U.S.A. is now not as severe as it formerly was and overall declines may be slowing.","The species inhabits well-drained short‐ and mixed‐grass native prairies, usually in patches of at least 65 ha with low canopy cover and a low amount of woody vegetation (Environment Canada 2012, Muller et al. 2018, S. Davis in litt. 2020). Population density increases with pasture size (Davis 2004), especially with sparse to intermediate grass densities and intermediate grass heights, moderate litter depths, few shrubs and little woody vegetation (Dechant et al. 1999, Environment Canada 2012, Davis et al. 2020); pipit densities have been shown to be over 6 times higher in areas surrounded by at least 50% grassland (Environment Canada 2012). The species also breeds in planted grasslands in some parts of its range (Davis 2018), predominantly in those with similar vegetation characteristics to native grasslands. In particular, planted fields with a low amount of alfalfa and suitable vegetation height (20–30 cm) are likely suitable breeding sites (Fisher and Davis 2011a). On migration, the species also occurs in stubble and fallow fields. In winter, it occupies a wider variety of grasslands, including non-native, planted and anthropogenic grasslands (Muller et al. 2018). It arrives late April to mid-May on the breeding grounds, and late September to early November on the wintering grounds (Robbins and Dale 1999, Davis et al. 2020).","Conversion of prairie to seeded pasture, hayfields and cropland, and inappropriate grazing are responsible for habitat loss, degradation of remaining grassland, increased juvenile mortality and rapid declines in population (Fisher and Davis 2011b, Davis et al. 2020). Since the early 1800s, the prairies of North America have declined by ~79% and the negative effects of such conversion can spread into the surrounding grasslands, now considered the most endangered ecosystem in North America (Roch and Jaeger 2014, Davis et al. 2020). As a result, birds are potentially responding to edge to area ratio (Davis 2004); distance to crops/hay (Koper and Schmiegelow 2006); or the amount of grassland in the surrounding landscape (Davis et al. 2013); as much as to area per se. Additionally, linear anthropogenic changes are associated with lowered densities (roads [Sutter et al. 2000], gas wells, pipelines, and trails [Linnen et al. 2006, Ludlow et al. 2015]). The large-scale introduction of non-native plant species and their subsequent invasion of native prairie have reduced breeding densities and breeding success (Ludlow et al. 2015, Davis et al. 2016, Davis 2017, Davis et al. 2020). Grazing and burning can have positive or negative impacts on suitable habitat depending on moisture, soil-types, plant species, intensity and frequency (Davis et al. 2020). Nests may be destroyed by haying prior to the fledging period, though the species rarely nests in hayfields. Virtual cessation of burning in the breeding zone and intensive grazing in the wintering zone has led to encroachment by shrubs and trees (Davis et al. 2020), and the preferred short prairie grass in wintering areas such as Texas is not conserved (J. Grantham in litt. 2003). Brood-parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds Molothrus ater is comparatively low, but is highest in fragmented habitat (Davis et al. 2020). Climate change is projected to cause a major range shift northwards, with possibly detrimental effects on the species due to limited availability of suitable habitat in the shifted range (Nixon et al. 2016).",Partners in Flight (2019) estimate the global population to number 1.4 million mature individuals.,Decreasing,"Anthus spragueii breeds relatively commonly in grasslands of south-east Alberta, southern Saskatchewan, south-west Manitoba and occasionally southern British Columbia, Canada, and north and central Montana, North Dakota, and locally South Dakota, casually to north-west Minnesota, U.S.A. (Prescott 1997, Prescott and Davis 1998, Robbins and Dale 1999, Davis et al. 2020). It winters throughout much of the southern U.S.A, particularly Arizona and Louisiana, and northern Mexico to Guerrero and Veracruz (Prescott and Davis 1998, Davis et al. 2014). The population has declined considerably since 1966 (Prescott 1997, Prescott and Davis 1998, D. R. C. Prescott in litt. 1999, Pardieck et al. 2018), but the most significant declines probably occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Robbins and Dale 1999, Davis et al. 2020); declines in Canada are considered to outweigh those in the USA (Pardieck et al. 2018).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIt is listed as Threatened in Canada (COSEWIC 1999). Most habitat is unprotected, but large areas are included in military reserves, national parks and on remaining provincial lands (Prescott and Davis 1998, Lipsey et al. 2015, R. Fisher and S. Davis in litt. 2016). These are relatively well protected against conversion to non-native cover. Agriculture censuses have provided some information on land-use trends, and breeding distribution and post-fledging movements are relatively well studied in Canada where monitoring programs and radio-tracking are underway (S. Jones in litt. 2003, Davis and Fisher 2009). This species forms part of many grassland conservation programmes in Canada (R. Fisher in litt. 2016), and receives some protection as part of the Migratory Bird Convention Act in Canada, which is part of the Migratory Bird Treaty with the U.S.A. (R. Fisher in litt. 2016). They are also incorporated in the Federal Provincial South of the Divide Action Plan for Multiple Species At Risk, and there is a recovery plan in place in Canada (see Environment Canada 2012, Environment and Climate Change Canada 2016)Conservation Actions ProposedDetermine breeding distribution, centres of winter abundance, population size and decline rates. Monitor habitat conversion rates. Assess threats on wintering grounds. Protect large tracts of native grasslands (Dechant et al. 1999). The size of habitat required is disputed, with a minimum size of 65 ha suggested (S. Jones in litt. 2003, Davis 2004, Environment Canada 2012, Davis et al. 2020). Manage grasslands by removing invasive woody vegetation, and graze to maintain good to excellent range condition. A short burning rotation may be beneficial in more mesic areas or where growing conditions are good, but would have negative consequences in more arid locations/conditions and at sites with unproductive soils (S. Jones in litt. 2003, Davis et al. 2020). Manage livestock grazing and burning regimes to allow the grassland vegetation to reach a certain height and density, particularly on the wintering grounds (Muller et al. 2018). Potentially delay hayfield mowing until 15 July although this habitat is not thought to be of significant importance for breeding birds (McMaster et al. 2005, Davis 2018).

Various adjacent habitats are required in the 2,300 m intermontane basin (J. R. Young in litt. 1999, Storch 2000). These differ seasonally and for age and sex classes (J. R. Young in litt. 1999). The species is totally reliant on sagebrush Artemisia spp. for seasonal cover and winter foraging (Young et al. 2000), but it also uses areas where sagebrush occurs together with more deciduous shrubs, e.g. Quercus spp., Amelanchier spp., Prunus spp. (Braun et al. 2014). Lek sites have low vegetation with sparse shrubs, and are often surrounded by the big sagebrush-dominated plant communities required for nesting (BLM 1999). Broods are reared (May to autumn) in adjacent riparian plant communities and in mesic upland sites (BLM 1999, J. R. Young in litt. 2005). Nesting success is relatively high and apparently unrelated or only weakly related to local-scale and landscape-scale features (Stanley et al. 2015). Similarly, adult survival was found to be constant across years and between populations (Davis et al. 2015). In winter, the species associates with watercourses on southerly or westerly slopes and ridge tops where deep snow is less likely (BLM 1999).","Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation is resulting from conversion to roads, reservoirs, livestock-grazing, hay and other crops, real estate developments, powerlines, land treatments and increased deer populations (BLM 1999, J. R. Young in litt. 1999). Many winter sites are directly threatened and being enclosed by urbanisation (Storch 2000). Inbreeding depression appears to be occurring due to the skewed mating system at leks: six of the seven extant populations now appear to be low enough to be suffering from this (Stiver et al. 2008). Severe winters and potentially droughts may represent survival bottlenecks (e.g. in 1984, less than 10% of sagebrush emerged above the snow [Storch 2000]), as may other habitat factors influencing chick survival (J. R. Young in litt. 2005). Calls to increase gas prospecting in areas of sagebrush habitat represent a potential future threat. Overhunting and poaching have contributed to the severe population declines in the past, but hunting of the species has been entirely banned since 2000 (Young et al. 2020).","Population size estimates vary for this species, ranging from roughly 3,300 mature individuals (Young et al. 2020) to 8,400 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019). High counts (3-year average; USFWS 2019) give numbers of 885 males on leks. Assuming an equal sex ratio, this would equate to 1,770 mature individuals. No information on detectability is given, but it is likely that the true population size is larger than this number. Studies have detected low levels of gene flow between sites; therefore the species is tentatively assessed as forming only one subpopulation (USFWS 2019, Zimmerman et al. 2019 and references therein).",Decreasing,"Centrocercus minimus is confined to the Gunnison basin in Gunnison and Saguache counties, south-west Colorado, with small, fragmented populations in Colorado and one in south-east Utah, U.S.A. (Storch 2000, Young et al. 2000, USFWS 2019). Historically, it presumably also occurred in Arizona, Oklahoma and New Mexico, but following intense habitat loss due to land-use change as well as hunting it is now confined to only 8% of its original range (BLM 1999, Schroeder et al. 2004, Braun et al. 2014, Young et al. 2020). 85-90% of the population occur in one site in the Gunnison Basin, with a further seven small populations in the vicinity (USFWS 2019, Zimmerman et al. 2019).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In 1995 a working group was formed and, in 1998, a conservation plan identified over 200 actions (BLM 1999, J. R. Young in litt. 1999). By 2004, over 95% of the population was covered by local working groups' conservation plans (J. R. Young in litt. 2005). While the success of such local efforts may be controversial, hunting has ceased and significant gains have been made in land protection through conservation easements and land acquisitions (J. R. Young in litt. 2005). Current actions include lek enhancement, riparian area restoration, nest habitat treatments, improved livestock management, nest predator research, and education (J. R. Young in litt. 1999, Young et al. 2020). Education measures include sponsored grouse viewing, information brochures and talks given in local schools and fairs (W. Martinson in litt. 2003). Radio-telemetry and graduate research is helping to determine winter habitat use, and lek sites have been protected (W. Martinson in litt. 2003). Hunting of the species has been stopped (C. Braun in litt. 2005, J. R. Young in litt. 2005). In 2005 state and federal employees drafted a 'Rangewide Plan' and have begun contact with local landowners to present voluntary conservation agreements (J. R. Young in litt. 2005). Conservation Actions ProposedRestore and improve habitat. Prevent further habitat loss and fragmentation. Continue population monitoring at key sites. Conduct further ecological research, focussing on survival, dispersal and habitat use at different life stages. Encourage and facilitate the implementation of local and range-wide management plans.

The species occurs between sea level and 800 m (Quintero and Jetz 2018).","In its wintering range in Australia the major threat is from drought (Clemens 2017), the frequency and severity of which are predicted to increase as the climate changes (Evans et al. 2017). Elsewhere, the main threats are changes to coastal stopover locations, particularly along the coast of the Yellow Sea where there is rapid development for aquaculture and industry, invasion by cord grass Spartina alterniflora, pollution from domestic, industrial and aquaculture discharges, oil and pesticides, and hunting and incidental drowning in fishing nets and traps. The habitat area is also shrinking through a combination of restricted inflow of sediments from increasingly dammed rivers (Murray et al. 2014, Melville et al. 2016) and sea level rise with sea walls at many sites preventing suitable habitat migrating inland. There is little understanding of how to manage these threats, whilst there is limited attempts to implement such management knowledge as is available. China stopped major reclamation in early 2018, and designation of migratory bird sanctuaries along the coast of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Gulf as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Melville 2018, UNESCO 2019) should reduce some risks, although major political, social and economic hurdles remain.","Hansen et al.

The species has been evidenced to be positively associated with lowland forest, herbaceous and wetland habitat at the expense of higher elevation coniferous forest in the central Appalachians (Slover and Katzner 2016) whilst the species also exhibits negative associations with higher elevation Appalachian sites within its range to the north (Hunt 2006). Some lower elevation sites from which the species was identified in the central Appalachians in 2017 were however, actually situated at a greater altitude than the highest elevation sites from which the species was identified in 2006 in the northern Appalachians, suggesting that the species utilised progressively higher elevation sites as your progress southwards through its range (Hunt 2006, Slover and Katzner 2016, T. Katzner in litt. 2020). There is little information about habitat preferences during migration and in the non-breeding range, but in south-eastern U.S.A. it is mainly found in mixed woodland (Cink et al. 2017), occupying forest habitats to a greater degree than agricultural landscapes (Ross and Driscoll 2019). It feeds during moonlit times of the night as well as at dawn and dusk, usually sallying after insect prey (Cink et al. 2017). It nests directly in the leaf litter, not building a nest, and two clutches may be attempted; with the first being in April-early June and the second brood being attempted c.30-35 days after the first (see Cink et al. 2017).","Whilst the species is thought to be able to tolerate some habitat degradation, the predominant threat is considered to be forest loss and degradation (Slover and Katzner 2016). Tracewski et al. (2016) estimate forest loss of ~5.3% across three generations throughout this species's range and it is this loss of forest, predominantly to agriculture and increased pressures from grazing and urbanisation, that is thought to have driven the species's witnessed declines; grazing of forest underbrush (used as nesting cover by the species) by sheep may have led to its disappearance in some areas whilst habitat loss (and by-product increases in predation) due to urbanisation may have led to the species's disappearance from south-east Pennsylvania (Cink et al. 2017). A. vociferus however, requires a mosaic of young forest and open areas for nesting therefore declines are thought to occur not only in response to forest loss, but also through the succession of open habitat and formerly fragmented semi-natural landscapes to dense forest and closure of forest gaps that prevent successful nesting by the species (Hunt 2013, Slaver and Katzner 2016, Cink et al. 2017). The species also sits at the side of roads, which means it is at high risk from traffic collision, and there are untested theories that industrial pollution and pesticide use could be reducing prey abundance (see Cink et al. 2017).","Partners in Flight (2020) estimate the population size to be 1,800,000 mature individuals.",Stable,"Antrostomus vociferus is a migratory species, breeding from southern central to eastern Canada and through central to eastern U.S.A.. The species overwinters in south-eastern U.S.A., Mexico and into Central America.","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThis species is listed as a Threatened species in Kansas (Platt 1974), and is placed on the Yellow watch list by Partners in Flight (Rosenberg et al. 2016).Conservation Actions ProposedConduct research to better understand the threats to this species.

C. Torres-Mura in litt. 1999, Reyes-Arriagada et al. 2012). Breeding begins in November. One egg is laid in late November-early December with hatching in late January-mid February. Fledging occurs in May. The species forms mixed-species colonies with Juan Fernandez Petrel P. externa (Carboneras 1992), typically forming small monospecific clusters of burrows in shallow soils within the larger P. externa colony (Hodum and Wainstein 2003, 2004; Reyes-Arriagada et al. 2012).

C. Torres-Mura in litt.1999, Hodum and Wainstein 2003, 2004, Hodum 2009). Stejneger's Petrel appears to be disproportionately preyed upon in comparison with the larger Juan Fernandez Petrel and there is the suggestion that a population decline has occurred, most likely driven by predation at breeding sites (Shirahai et al. 2015). Additionally, feral cats prey on near-fledging chicks when they are on the surface exercising their flight muscles, although predation rates have not been quantified (Hodum 2009). Rodents also contribute to slowing native forest regeneration by eating fruit, seeds and seedlings. Cattle are a potential problem, causing defoliation, accelerated soil erosion and compaction, their impact however, seems to be limited to lower elevations than Stejneger’s Petrel is known to nest. Due to being a restricted range species, Stejneger’s Petrel is very vulnerable to habitat shifting and alteration due to climate change, as well as extreme weather events, such as four landslides caused by a storm in 2002.","In 1986, the population was estimated at 131,000 pairs (Carboneras 1992), implying a world population in excess of 400,000 individuals.

It usually nests in burrows associated with the root structure of trees, including Ohia lehua (Metrosideros polymorpha) and a dominant understory of densely matted uluhe fern (Dicranopteris linearis) in montane mesic forests on steep slopes (Ainley et al. 1997, N. Holmes in litt. 2007). In general, it can nest in any habitat that is free of predators (Troy et al. 2016, D. Ainley in litt. 2016).The breeding season begins in April, when birds return to prospect for nest sites and, following an exodus in late April, egg-laying in early June is highly synchronised (NSWG 2005). Pairs produce one egg, which is incubated for an average of 53-54 days, followed by a fledging period of 81-94 days (NSWG 2005). Most young fledge by November (Mitchell et al. 2005). The age at first breeding is around six or seven years (Mitchell et al. 2005). The species's diet is not well known, although it likely consists of fish and squid, particularly flyingfish and Purpleback Flying Squid (Mitchell et al. 2005, Ainley et al. 2014). It forages for hundreds of kilometres offshore, often in large, mixed species flocks associated with schools of large, predatory fish that drive prey species to the ocean surface (Mitchell et al. 2005, NSWG 2005).","The main threat to this species is thought to be predation by non-native species (D. Ainley in litt. 1999, Mitchell et al. 2005, NSWG 2005). Predation of adults and juveniles by feral cats Felis catus and Barn Owls Tyto alba has been documented on almost every colony on Kaua'i, including the most remote sites (NSWG 2005, Griesmer and Holmes 2011). Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans, Black Rats R. rattus, Brown Rats R. rattus and House Mice Mus musculus were inadvertently introduced to the Hawaiian islands as a result of human activity and shipwrecks (Duffy 2010) and may depredate eggs and chicks (NSWG 2005). Brown Rats appear to be more associated with human settlement and do not appear to be as severe a threat as the other two introduced rat species (Raine et al. 2017). Another potential predator, the Small Indian Mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, has recently been discovered on Kaua'i (NSWG 2005), and could potentially be a greater threat than cats as its smaller size means it may be able to enter breeding burrows more easily (Duffy and Capece 2014). It is yet to establish a permanent presence on the island (D. Ainley in litt. 2016), although it has a history of incursions onto Kaua'i and one was trapped there in 2016 (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). When the Two-spotted Leafhopper Sophonia rufofascia first established on the Hawaiian Islands, it led to habitat loss through feeding on the Uluhe Fern Dicranopteris linearis which provide cover for shearwater burrows (Cooper and Day 1998). The leafhopper was a cause for great concern not only for shearwaters, but also for agricultural crops and native flora; hence a biological control programme was initiated and the insect is now hard to find on Hawai'i (Coll and Wajnberg 2017). Dogs have been shot at Ka'ena Point, while attacking nestling albatrosses and shearwaters (Duffy 2010), but the scale of their impact is unknown. Habitat loss due to conversion and introduction of herbivores like domesticated goats and pigs pose another threat on the Hawaiian Islands (Reed et al. 2012), and have been suggested as a contributing factor for the recent abandonment of some colonies (Troy and Holmes 2008, N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). On Kaua'i, hurricanes Iwa and Iniki devastated the forests in 1982 and 1992, dramatically reducing available nesting habitat and reducing breeding attempts for Newell’s Shearwaters (Ainley et al. 1997, Griesmer and Holmes 2011). Given that a large proportion of the population breeds on Kaua'i, catastrophic events, like hurricanes, represent a serious threat (Mitchell et al. 2005). During the 1980s and 1990s an estimated 70 adults and 280 subadults each summer, and at least 340 fledglings each autumn, died as a result of collisions with power-lines and communications towers, or indirectly because of light attraction (Podolsky et al. 1998, Anon. 2007). In the surveyed areas on eastern and southern Kaua'i, 350 adults are reported dead each year from collisions with power lines (Podolsky et al. 1998). Fledglings on their first flight to the ocean are particularly susceptible to attraction to artificial light. The birds are attracted and disoriented by coastal street lights and once grounded, unable to fly and often killed by cars, cats or dogs, or die from starvation or dehydration (Mitchell et al. 2005). Between 1978 and 1981, more than 5,000 individuals were grounded on Kaua'i, and more than 30,000 have been found as victims of fallout since 1971 (Anon. 2007, Griesemer and Holmes 2011). Intense rescue programmes have been initiated to find grounded birds and return them to the sea (Everett and Pitman 1993). On Kaua'i, approximately 1,500 fledglings are recovered annually after becoming grounded (Mitchell et al. 2005), although with the suspected steep population decline on Kaua'i, the number of grounded birds is expected to have decreased proportionately (D. Ainley in litt. 2016). Collision with artificial structures (such as powerlines and wind turbines) is another key threat to the species, particularly in flight corridors for subadult and adult birds accessing inland colonies. Nine communications towers have recently been constructed on the Hawaiian Islands without proper consultation, and these are now the subject of an ongoing lawsuit (Anon. 2007). A field of wind generators was planned for Kaua'i and Lana'i (Department of Business, Economic Development and Tourism 2009 in Duffy 2010), without accounting for the potential impacts on this species. Although wind farms have been shown to have only minor effects on other bird species elsewhere, night-flying Shearwaters may be particularly vulnerable and the cumulative effects of construction and maintenance, erosion, vegetation clearing and noise should be accounted for (Duffy 2010). It is not confirmed whether the wind farm projects will be realised (T. Holmes in litt. 2007, A. Raine in litt. 2016). Plastic pollution poses yet another threat. On Kaua'i, 50% of Newell’s Shearwater fledglings necropsied during 2007–2014 contained plastic items in their digestive tract and there is evidence that the mass and the number of items ingested per bird have also increased since the 1980s (Kain et al. 2016). It is thought that consumption of even small quantities of plastic, including fibres and small fragments, exposes birds at all stages of the breeding cycle to plastic-associated co-pollutants and associated impacts survival (Kain et al. 2016). On Hawai'i, cinder mining has resulted in habitat loss at several colonies (US Fish and Wildlife Service 1983 in Reynolds and Ritchotte 1997, Mitchell et al. 2005) and together with other causes of habitat degradation (invasive vegetation, agriculture and urbanisation) contributes to the exposure and increased predation of ground-nesting birds (Reynolds and Ritchotte 1997). The species is also likely to be impacted by the commercial fishery through bycatch and indirect ecosystem effects resulting from overfishing of tuna Tunnus spp. (Mitchell et al. 2005, Waugh et al. 2012).","There have been several population size estimates for this species (see Griesemer and Holmes 2011), but the most recent gives a minimum population estimate of 27,011 individuals (Joyce 2016), which roughly equates to 18,000 mature individuals. However, given the decline on Kauai and near extirpation from Maui, the population size could now be far smaller (D. Ainley in litt. 2016). The population size is therefore precautionarily placed in the band 10,000-19,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Puffinus newelli nests principally on the mountains of Kaua`i in the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.). Small colonies exist on Moloka'i, Hawai`i and possibly Maui, with unconfirmed records from Lana`i. After not having been recorded on Oahu since the 1700s, a survey carried out in 2016-2017 located the species in two sites at Mount Kaala and at Poamoho, suggesting that it regularly visits or even breeds on the island (Young et al. 2019).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIn the late 1970s, a cross-fostering experiment was carried out at Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge (Kaua'i), in which 90 eggs were placed in nests of the Wedge-tailed Shearwater (Ardenna pacifica) (Anon. 2007). Subsequently, 30 young were fledged. Four breeding pairs nesting in 2006 were believed to be descendents of fostered birds (Anon. 2007). Between 2006 and 2013, colony calls were played at the Kilauea Point National Wildlife Refuge and artificial burrows constructed to attract nesting pairs, as there is a low threat from alien predators or collisions with artificial structures (Anon. 2007). Subsequently, up to 13 pairs have been recorded there (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). After the construction of a predator-proof fence in 2015 within the Refuge, 8 chicks were translocated to the site from montane colonies and were raised to fledging (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). It is planned to translocate up to 50 chicks to the Refuge over a five year period (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). Also since 2015, social attraction has also been employed in an attempt to save the population on Maui. While the results are looking favourable, it is too soon to evaluate success (D. Ainley in litt. 2016).In total, predator control and monitoring activities are in place at six colonies on Kaua'i, which involve the control of cats, rats, pigs and Barn Owls as well as monitoring the effectiveness of these activities through the use of cameras and acoustic monitoring devices (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). On Kauai', Barn Owl control is also carried out at another five colonies located along the Na Pali coast, Kalaheo/Kahili and Hanalei valley (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). The effectiveness of Barn Owl control is being monitored through the deployment of acoustic recording devices via helicopter in management areas (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016).There is an active programme to control lights across Kaua'i. Building's lighting has been effectively re-designed to reduce collisions (Ainley et al. 1997). A ruling brought by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2006 under the U.S. Endangered Species Act has enforced a campaign, in which all non-essential lights on Kaua`i are required to be turned off or shielded between 15 September and 15 December when young birds leave their nests (Appel 2006). In the course of the campaign, also street lights are darkened or turned off by the island's electricity company. Moreover, the electricity company of Kaua'i has started incorporating a range of measures to reduce powerline collisions, including moving lines underground, lowering them, fitting diverters and testing a ‘laser fence’ on key lines to make them more visible to birds moving at night (Griesmer and Holmes 2011, N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). Several lawsuits have already been brought forward for violations under the Endangered Species Act (Harrison 2009), including against a hotel which was responsible for over one quarter of all birds downed as a result of light pollution. However, there is still a considerable amount of infrastructure that needs to be modified. It is not expected that the threat posed by artificial lighting will ever be completely eliminated (N. Holmes in litt. 2007). Yet overall, significant improvements have been made to reduce light attraction and collision (N. Holmes in litt. 2007). Over 30,000 downed birds have been rescued and released through the Save Our Shearwaters programme since 1979 (Raine et al. 2017), although few of these birds have subsequently been found again (NSWG 2005, D. Ainley in litt. 2016). Conservation Actions ProposedEnforce regulatory compliance to minimize light attraction (N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). Continue predator control in remaining populations in north-west Kaua'i (Ainley et al. 1997, N. Holmes in litt. 2007, N. Holmes and A. Raine in litt. 2016). Establish predator-free colonies through fencing, trapping of predators, and use social attraction to entice shearwaters to nest within (Griesemer and Holmes 2011, D. Ainley in litt. 2016). Continue to use radar observations to monitor population trends and develop methods to monitor breeding success (Mitchell et al. 2005, NSWG 2005). Conduct long-term demographic studies to measure the success of habitat and predator management (Mitchell et al. 2005). Continue to retrieve grounded birds (N. Holmes in litt. 2007). Evaluate the survival rates of released birds and test alternative rehabilitation practices (NSWG 2005). Continue to search for additional breeding areas and carry out further research into foraging range and feeding behaviour (Mitchell et al. 2005, NSWG 2005). Initiate studies into the potential effects of the tuna fishery on the species's populations, perhaps by modelling interactions (Mitchell et al. 2005, NSWG 2005).",Nearctic|Oceanian,,false,false,Global

Recent information suggest that these declines may have stopped by now, but in the absence of further evidence to show a stable population, the species is conservatively retained as declining. Thus, as the rate of decline does not meet the threshold for Vulnerable anymore, the species has been downlisted to Near Threatened.","The species generally occurs in dense, dry deciduous shrubland maintained by disturbances, such as fire, in forest-grassland ecotone and in successional vegetation (Grzybowski 1995, Brewer 2018). Its habitat is dominated by densely foliated shrubs like Diospyros texana, Rhus virens and Sophora segundiflora and oaks (M. Lockwood in litt. 1999). In Oklahoma and Texas, it is found in deciduous and oak-juniper woodlands, but also in xeric thornscrub, while juveniles show a preference for riparian vegetation (Grzybowski 1995, Smith et al. 2012a, Dittmar 2014). In Mexico, it breeds in chaparral and submontane thornscrub at elevations of 920-2,000 m, but it may also use patches of suitable habitat within urban areas (Howell and Webb 1995, Contreras-Balderas et al. 2012, González-Rojas et al. 2014, J. I. González-Rojas in litt. 2016). Little is known of the species's migration routes. It likely migrates through the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Transvolcanic Mexican Belt, although further research is needed to confirm this (MacGregor-Fors et al. 2012, I. MacGregor-Fors in litt. 2016). The species winters in tropical dry forests and pine-oak forests from the lowlands up to 1,600 m, preferring tropical deciduous forest associated with rivers and streams (Howell and Webb 1995, Gonzalez-Medina et al. 2009, Colón et al. 2015). Wintering density in Sinaloa has been calculated to be 8 individuals per km2 (Gonzalez-Medina et al. 2009).","The species is threatened by several processes. Habitat loss and degradation are thought to be the key threats. Among these, fire suppression is probably the most serious threat, but also urban development, intensive grazing and browsing by livestock and native and introduced ungulates, and agricultural conversion have caused significant habitat loss in North America (Grzybowski 1995, J. Lyons in litt. 1999, USFWS 2018a). In the wintering range, habitat has been cleared for agriculture and grazing, reducing the potential suitable area or causing habitat fragmentation and declines in habitat quality (Miles et al. 2006, González-Medina et al. 2009). Further threats include brood parasitism. Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) inflict rates of parasitism of up to 100% at some sites (Grzybowski 1995, Farrell et al. 2011). Rates of nest predation as high as 50% in some locations have been reported. Snakes and birds are the primary predators of this species, with mammals, ants (e.g. fire ants Solenopsis spp.) and katydids also found to predate the species (Stake and Cimprich 2003, Campomizzi et al. 2009, Conkling et al. 2012, Smith et al. 2012b). Furthermore, habitat may be fragmented by the development of oil and gas pipelines as well as access corridors for windfarms (L. O'Donnell in litt. 2019). The high return rates of birds to breeding territories suggests few threats on the wintering grounds, even though less than 10% of the wintering area is protected (Grzybowski 1995, Vega Rivera et al. 2011, USFWS 2018a). Deforestation along the presumed migratory routes may potentially have a negative impact on the species (I. MacGregor-Fors in litt. 2016).","The global population size is difficult to determine. Rosenberg et al. (2016) estimate the global population size to be 24,000 mature individuals. This number is based on an estimate of c.12,000 mature individuals in U.S.A. (Wilkins et al. 2006) and recent discoveries of high-density breeding populations in Mexico, which could mean that a doubling of the U.S.A. estimate may be appropriate (Rosenberg et al. 2016). It should be noted, though, that while Benson and Benson (1990) estimate c.6,300 ± 3,200 pairs in northern Coahuila, other estimates for Mexican populations have been very low. Wilkins et al. (2006) estimated only 259 males in Mexico, and Morrison and González-Rojas (2014) found only 341 individuals in three states of Mexico. Therefore, the global population size is here tentatively placed in the range 10,000-19,999 mature individuals. All individuals belong to the same subpopulation (Zink et al. 2010).",Decreasing,"This species once bred from Kansas through Oklahoma and Texas (U.S.A.) into central Coahuila, northwestern and southern Nuevo Leon and southwestern Tamaulipas (Mexico) (Contreras-Balderas et al. 2012,  González-Rojas et al. 2014, J. I. González-Rojas in litt. 2016). Its breeding range has contracted though, and it is now thought to be absent from Kansas, and is only found in isolated patches in the Wichita Mountains in Oklahoma (Grzybowski 1995, T. McFarland in litt. 2016). In Texas, the species is known to occur in 57 counties, being more common in the western part of the state (McFarland et al. 2012). In the non-breeding season, it migrates to the west of Mexico along the Pacific coast, where it winters from Sinaloa to Oaxaca (Grzybowski 1995, Howell and Webb 1995, S. N. G. Howell in litt. 1998, Vega Rivera et al. 2011, Colón et al. 2015). Winter records from Sonora likely refer to individuals on migration (Powell 2013).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayConservation actions are occurring on public and private land. Management programs to restore vegetation have occurred at various locations including Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge, Fort Hood, Ker Wildlife Management Area and Wichita Mountains (Grzybowski 1995, Sexton 1997, Kostecke et al. 2005). On private land, conservation has occurred through various programs including Habitat Conservation Plans, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department’s Wildlife Management Plans, the Landowner Incentive Program, and the Leon River Restoration Project. Brown-headed Cowbirds are trapped to reduce brood-parasitism. Research is ongoing on breeding and wintering areas in Mexico and the USA. Modelling work on the species's migration is ongoing (I. MacGregor-Fors in litt. 2016). The species is included on the 'Watch List' of the State of North America's Birds as a species of high conservation concern (NABCI 2016). In the U.S.A., it was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 1987, but de-listed in 2018 following the recovery of the population (USFWS 2018b).Conservation Actions ProposedMonitor the population size and trend. Clarify the distribution in Mexico and estimate breeding numbers. Continue to study the species's migration routes (MacGregor-Fors et al. 2012) and identify important stopover sites (I. MacGregor-Fors in litt. 2016). Research the species's ability to adapt to habitat changes and urban environments (A. J. Contreras Balderas in litt. 2016). Investigate dispersal and survival of juveniles during migration and on wintering grounds (Dittmar 2014). Develop conservation actions through engagement with private landowners to balance conservation actions with other land uses. Assess threats on wintering grounds (J. Lyons in litt. 1999). Coordinate a range-wide action plan (J. A. Grzybowski in litt. 1999). Restore suitable habitat within the breeding range, including managing areas to promote dense deciduous cover for nesting (Bailey and Thompson 2007) and protect riparian vegetation (Dittmar 2014). Continue to manage cowbird populations, as research suggests that recovery of the species relies on such management (Campomizzi et al. 2013, Wilsey et al. 2013, T. McFarland in litt. 2016).

However, it declined rapidly between 1975 and 1985, predominantly due to invasive species and disease. By mid-1997 only three individuals remained. One was captured in 2004, but it died later that year. The other two individuals have not been reported since 2003 and 2004, with no others reported despite intensive surveys. A set of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017) laid out methods for quantitatively estimating a species’s probability of extinction based on parameters associated with threats, in addition to records and surveys. Based on the application of these methods (Butchart et al. 2018), this species is regarded as extinct.","It was found in remote `ohi`a forest (T. Pratt in litt. 1999) at 1,400-2,100 m, but this may be suboptimal habitat as subfossil evidence indicates that it occurred in much drier habitat at 300-1,500 m (Mountainspring et al. 1990, Reilly 1998, P. Baker in litt. 1999). It fed primarily on snails, insects and spiders, and occasionally fruit (Pratt et al. 1997, M. Collins in litt. 1999). The two known nests were found in `ohi`a trees (Pratt et al. 1997).","Habitat destruction and modification, and the rapid spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes in the lowlands are thought to be responsible for past declines (Mountainspring et al. 1990, T. Pratt in litt. 1999). The precise causes of the recent population decline are unknown (Rosa et al. 1998), although a correlation with a concurrent 473% increase in pig activity within the Hanawi NAR has been hypothesised, as indexed by ground-cover disturbance (Mountainspring et al. 1990). Predation by introduced rats, cats and small Indian mongooses Herpestes auropunctatus is also possible. Rats and the introduced garlic snail (Oxychilus alliarius) have been blamed for the decline of native land snails, an important food source for the Poo-uli (Groombridge et al. 2004).",One of the last three known individuals died in captivity in 2004. The other two have not been seen since 2003 and 2004 respectively. No new individuals have been found since 1998 (K.

During 1975-1985, there was a rapid decline in density in the upper Hanawi watershed (Mountainspring et al. 1990), the last area from which it was known. In 1995, only five to seven birds were known but, by mid-1997, only three individuals could be found (two male, one possibly female), each with distinct home ranges in Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (NAR) and the immediately adjacent Haleakala National Park (Baker 2001). One of three known individuals (male) was captured in September 2004 but died on 28 November 2004 (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006, VanderWerf et al. 2006). The two other individuals may both have been male, but neither have been seen since 2003 and 2004 (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006) and are likely to have now died (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006). No other individuals have been located since 1998 despite almost constant presence of researchers in the field in recent years (K. Swinnerton in litt. 2006).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIn 1986, the 30 km2 Hanawi NAR was created to protect this species and, during 1990-1997, all feral pigs were systematically eradicated from three fenced areas (Anderson and Stone 1993, Pratt et al. 1997, Reilly 1998, Rosa et al. 1998). In 2006, the East Maui Watershed Partnership (EMWP) completed a c.5000 ha fenced unit adjacent to and east of Hanawi NAR incorporating the Ko'olau Forest Preserve, Haiku Uka and Waikamoi Forest Preserve, between about 1,000 m and 2,400 m elevation. Feral ungulate control was completed by 2012, although continued maintenance and ungulate surveys continue regularly.Two wild birds were briefly united when one was caught and moved into the home range of another. However, after just one day the translocated bird had returned to its own territory (Groombridge et al. 2004).

The northern populations of this species are migratory, dispersing widely after breeding before travelling southwards to the wintering grounds (del Hoyo et al. 1996).  Habitat Breeding It breeds in a variety of locations with bare or sparsely vegetated islands, banks, flats, or spits of dry mud and sand including barrier beaches (shoals), dunes, saltmarshes, saltpans, freshwater lagoons, estuaries, deltas, inland lakes, rivers, marshes and swamps (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). During this season, it may also feed on emerging insects over lakes, agricultural fields, grasslands and even over semi-desert regions (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding On passage the species typically forages over saltpans, coastal lagoons, mudflats, marshes and wet fields, overwintering on estuaries, saltpans, lagoons and saltmarshes, or in more inland sites such as large rivers, lakes, rice-fields, sewage ponds, reservoirs, saltpans and irrigation canals (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet It is an opportunistic feeder and is largely insectivorous taking adult and larval terrestrial and aquatic insects (such as Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera) as well as spiders, earthworms, small reptiles, frogs, small fish (6-9 cm long), aquatic invertebrates and rarely voles and small birds (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a scrape in dried mud, sand or gravel on beaches, dry mudflats, dykes, sea-wrack on the tideline or on floating vegetation (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996).","This species has been identified as particularly susceptible to abandonment of breeding sites due to human disturbance (Molina et al. 2014), although early dispersal from breeding sites appears to be a behavioural trait of the species that may mitigate the impact of disturbance.","The global population of G. nilotica and G. macrotarsa combined is estimated to number c.150,000-420,000 individuals (Delany and Scott 2006), but the global population of G. nilotica has not been estimated separately following the taxonomic split. The European population is estimated at 16,600-21,200 pairs, which equates to 33,200-42,400 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II.

Males undergo a post-breeding moult migration from early-May to early-June (females moulting one month later) during which they are flightless for 3-4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996). The autumn migration chiefly occurs between September and October (western Europe), during which the species is likely to travel on a broad front (e.g. across Arabia and into Africa) (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is usually found in pairs or small parties, although it often congregates when feeding (flocks of 20 or 30 to several hundred individuals occur in favoured areas in Africa and large concentrations form at stop-over sites on migration) (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005). The species forages diurnally and roosts communally at night (Brown et al. 1982). Habitat It inhabits permanent shallow freshwater wetlands from sea level up to 2,900 m (Ethiopia), preferred sites being those surrounded by dense stands of reeds or other emergent vegetation whilst being free of overhanging trees or fringing forest (Brown et al. 1982, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). Copious submerged aquatic vegetation sheltering abundant planktonic invertebrates is a valuable habitat characteristic (Johnsgard 1978). Suitable habitats include well-vegetated lakes and marshes and with muddy shores and substrates in open country (e.g. grasslands), as well as oxbow lakes, channels and swamps (former U.S.S.R.) (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Flint et al. 1984, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005). It also frequents artificial waters bordered by lush grassland such as sewage farms, rice-fields and fish ponds (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005, Musil 2006). In the winter it can be found on coastal brackish lagoons, tidal muflats, estuaries, coastal shorelines, fresh and brackish estuarine marshes, inland seas and brackish or saline inland waters, occasionally occurring (briefly) on marine waters during migration (although it generally avoids very saline habitats) (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). Diet Its diet consists of small aquatic invertebrates such as adult and larval insects (e.g. caddisfly larvae, damselfly and dragonfly nymphs, adult beetles, bugs and flies), molluscs, planktonic crustaceans, the seeds of emergent and aquatic plants (e.g. bulrushes and waterweeds), annelids, amphibian spawn, tadpoles, spiders, fish and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (e.g. duckweeds) (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). Breeding site The nest is a scrape or depression on the ground in tall grass, among hummocks, in the open or (rarely) in bulrush marshes (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005). Usually the species nests close to water but if grass cover is unavailable in the wetland site it may also nest far away from water under bushes, in hayfields or in meadows (Flint et al. 1984, Kear 2005). Although it is not a colonial species, several pairs may nest in close proximity (Madge and Burn 1988). Management information A study in the Czech Republic found that fish ponds with a fish stock density of less than 400 kg/ha, water transparency of more than 50 cm, mixed fish stocks (e.g. tench and pike or perch) rather than monospecific stocks (e.g. of carp), and systems that include ponds with fish fry (to provide areas with low fish competition and high invertebrate availability) are more successful in supporting breeding pairs of this species (Musil 2006). The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK attracted nesting pairs to the area by causing an increase in invertebrate food availability and an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994).","The species is threatened by habitat loss in Britain and Ireland (Kear 2005), is occasionally killed by collisions with power transmission lines (Malcolm 1982), and suffers from nest predation by American mink Neovison vison (Opermanis et al. 2001, Nordström et al. 2002, Bartoszewicz and Zalewski 2003). It is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007) and avian botulism (Forrester et al. 1980), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. The species may suffer from reproductive impairment as a result of selenium accumulation in liver tissues (selenium contained in sub-surface agricultural drain-water used for wetland management in California led to bioaccumulation of the element in the food chain) (Paveglio et al. 1997). The species suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (Camargue, France and Spain [Mateo et al. 1998, Mondain-Monval et al. 2002]). Utilisation The species is a favoured quarry species throughout most of the world, but is rarely taken in large numbers (Kear 2005). It is hunted for sport in North America (Baldassarre and Bolen 1994), Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006) and the Po delta, Italy (Sorrenti et al. 2006), and is hunted commercially and recreationally in Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006). The eggs of this species used to be (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).","The global population is estimated to number 6,500,000-7,000,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). This roughly equates to 4,300,000-4,700,000 mature individuals.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory, and is likely to migrate without stopping on a broad front between breeding and non-breeding areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Migratory flocks form after the end of breeding between mid-June and early-August, and arrive in the wintering grounds between mid-July and November (adults and immature birds arriving before juveniles) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Those birds wintering in South-East Asia start moving northwards to the breeding grounds in late-February (the migration peaking in March to early-April), arriving from mid-March to May; whereas those wintering in East Africa and southern Asia depart for breeding grounds from mid-April to early-May (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Most non-adult wintering birds remain in the wintering areas during the breeding season (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species is typically gregarious, feeding in flocks of 2-50, and sometimes congregating in groups of up to 1,000 when roosting (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding During the breeding season, this species is predominantly found in open, dry, treeless, uncultivated areas up to 3,000 m, including dried mud, silt and clay flats, hard salt-pans overgrown with halophytic plants, and rocky plains near mountains in desert or semi-desert (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). In Turkey the species frequents heavily grazed saline steppe (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species usually breeds near water, but exceptionally it will nest up to 20 km away from it (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding During the non-breeding season, the species shows a preference for littoral habitats with mixed sand and mud substrata (Urban et al. 1986, Hockey et al. 2005). It is found on sheltered sandy, shelly or muddy beaches, large intertidal mudflats, sandbanks, salt-marshes, estuaries, coral reefs, rocky islands, tidal lagoons and dunes near the coast, although it may sometimes feed on coastal grasslands (Hayman et al. 1986, Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Hockey et al. 2005). Whilst on migration the species will occasionally utilise inland habitats such as salt-lakes and brackish swamps, usually roosting on sandbanks and spits (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet This species is carnivorous: during the breeding season its diet consists mainly of terrestrial insects and their larvae (especially beetles, termites, midges and ants), and occasionally lizards; whereas during the non-breeding season its diet contains mainly marine invertebrates such as molluscs (snails), worms and crustaceans (such as shrimps and crabs) (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground amongst sand-hills, gravel, or on other barren substrates (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996).","In some parts of its breeding range this species is threatened by the destruction of wetlands and bordering fallow steppe through drainage and water extraction for irrigation (Turkey) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is threatened by habitat degradation and loss throughout its non-breeding range: in Australia agricultural developments are reducing the area of coastal and inland habitat, and hydrological changes to estuaries are modifying important intertidal areas (National Parks and Wildlife Service 1999); key wetland sites in southern Africa (for example Walvis Bay, Namibia) are being degraded through wetland reclamation for suburb and port development, and changes in the flood regime due to road building (Wearne and Underhill 2005). Favoured migration staging posts, such as the Çukurova delta in southern Turkey are under increasing pressure from hunting, tourism and industrial activities and are often polluted along the coast with oil (Tucker and Heath 1994). One of the species's migratory staging areas in China (Chongming Island) is undergoing significant habitat loss and degradation through conversion to aquaculture ponds, farmlands and vegetable gardens, the cultivation of the alien plant Spartina alterniflora on tidal flats (promoting rapid sedimentation with the intention of reclaiming the area), and the Three Gorges Dam on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River reducing the supply of river-borne sediment to mudflats in the area (Ma et al. 2002). The species is also susceptible to disturbance from tourists in its non-breeding range (National Parks and Wildlife Service 1999, Wearne and Underhill 2005), and commercial hunting (for sale at market or to restaurants) is a major threat in the area of Chongming Island, China (Ma et al. 2002).","The global population is estimated to number c.150,000-340,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016). This roughly equates to 100,000-225,000 mature individuals.

It breeds in solitary pairs or loose groups from April to June, with males leaving the breeding areas first from May to early-June to undertake extensive moult migrations (females following later) (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996). During moult, large sexually segregated flocks gather in moulting areas (e.g. in the Netherlands and Russia), although small gatherings are also possible (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005). The flightless moult period lasts for around 4 weeks between July and August, after which flocks move southwards to winter quarters from mid-August onwards (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996). The species is highly gregarious in winter and on passage, often forming enormous concentrations (although the size of flock depends on the size of the wetland) (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It feeds nocturnally; flocks are roosting by day on open water (Brown et al. 1982, Hockey et al. 2005).  Habitat The species shows a preference for open lowland grassland, prairie or tundra habitats containing freshwater, brackish and saline wetlands with shallow water (10-30 cm deep) to facilitate dabbling (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). Wetland habitats include shallow freshwater marshes, small marshy lakes, slow-flowing rivers, wet meadows, flood-plains and sewage ponds (southern Africa), especially favouring ponds with low, dense marginal vegetation and wetlands interspersed with brushy thickets or copses (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Hockey et al. 2005). During the winter, it also frequents large inland lakes, brackish coastal lagoons, brackish and saline marshes, shallow fresh or brackish estuaries, tidal flats and river deltas with adjacent agricultural land (e.g. stubble fields) and scattered impoundments (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Steele et al. 1997, Snow and Perrins 1998).  Diet This species is omnivorous and opportunistic, its diet consisting of algae, seeds (e.g. cereals and rice), tubers (e.g. potatoes), and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants, sedges and grasses, as well as aquatic invertebrates (e.g. insects, molluscs and crustaceans), amphibians and small fish (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Hockey et al. 2005).  Breeding site The nest is a slight hollow on the ground amongst vegetation (e.g. rushes, grass or low scrub) and can be close to or more than 1 km away from water (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). The species is not normally colonial, but neighbours may nest as close as 2-3 m apart (Kear 2005).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat loss on its breeding and wintering grounds (Scott and Rose 1996). Reclamation of coastal areas for industrial development poses a threat in Europe, and major river diversion and irrigation schemes threaten wintering areas in Niger and Nigeria (Scott and Rose 1996). The species is also threatened by petroleum pollution, wetland drainage, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reeds in Russia (Grishanov 2006). Over-exploitation is a concern in Europe (Kear 2005). It also suffers poisoning from lead shot ingestion in North America (Baldassarre and Bolen 1994), poisoning from white phosphorous (from firearms) ingestion in Alaska (Steele et al. 1997), and reproductive impairment as a result of selenium accumulation in liver tissues (selenium contained in sub-surface agricultural drain-water used for wetland management in California led to bioaccumulation of the element in the food chain (Paveglio et al. 1997). The species is predated by feral cats Felis catus and rats Rattus norvegicus on islands (del Hoyo et al. 1992), and it is susceptible to avian botulism and avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Rocke 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. Utilisation The species is hunted for sport widely across its range; for example in North America (Baldassarre and Bolen 1994, Schmidt 2006), Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006) and the Po delta, Italy (Sorrenti et al. 2006), and it is also hunted commercially and recreationally in Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006).

The species is predominantly insectivorous (Straight and Cooper 2012, Cleere and Kirwan 2018). It breeds generally from mid-April to July, although commencement of breeding varies according to location, with individuals in the south of the breeding range starting even in early March, whereas in the north of the range breeding may not start until mid-May (Cleere and Kirwan 2018). The species is susceptible to disturbance during the nesting stage, and it has been reported that it may even move chicks and eggs in its mouth, although this behaviour has not been witnessed since the 19th Century (see Straight and Cooper 2012).","The species appears to be threatened by a range of factors. These include habitat degradation due to urban development, and the species’s habit of utilising roads for dust baths etc. at night means it is at risk from collisions with cars (see Straight and Cooper 2012). Forest loss within the species's range is currently estimated at ~8% per three generations (Tracewski et al. 2016). Chuck-will’s-widow is also very sensitive to disturbance (although this may just result in the moving of the nest rather than nest abandonment [see Straight and Cooper 2012]), and could be affected by pesticide use as it is insectivorous, and will feed over pasture (see Straight and Cooper 2012). It has also been suggested that changes in habitat may be bringing the species more into contact with competitors, such as Eastern Whip-poor-will. As the latter’s range alters it may potentially be causing indirect impacts on Chuck-will’s-widow, although there is little direct evidence for this currently (see Straight and Cooper 2012), and Eastern Whip-poor-will itself is thought to be declining moderately rapidly (Rosenberg et al. 2016), so it is highly unclear whether this species is having any impact on Chuck-will's-widow, and as such is not coded as a threat here.","Partners in Flight (2019) estimated the global population of mature individuals at 5,700,000.",Decreasing,"Antrostomus carolinensis is a migratory species that is considered generally common, breeding in eastern U.S.A., locally in southern Canada (extreme southern Ontario), and in the northern Bahamas (see Cleere and Kirwan 2018).

Today, fluctuations occur at some colonies, apparently relating to predators which can cause rapid declines; recoveries have been observed following predator control. Further threats to the species include habitat shifting and alteration from sea-level rise and subsidence, habitat degradation from recreational and commercial boating and shipping, disturbance from tourism and residential development, and coastal engineering (Wilson et al. 2012). ","Recent estimates suggest that the majority of the population is found in Mexico and Texas, USA (C. Green in litt. 2016). Surveys in western Mexico identified 43 breeding sites including 20 active nesting sites in Baja California, seven in Sinaloa, five in Baja California, eight in Sonora, and three in Chiapas/Oaxaca. The largest colony in western Mexico supports 258 breeding pairs while the average colony size was 18 pairs. The population estimate for the Pacific coast of Mexico is 1,108 breeding pairs (Palacios et al. 2018).

It has an extremely large range within which global declines of 10-29% are suspected, largely in response to habitat loss and degradation, hunting and disturbance, but perhaps also other as-yet-unidentified threats associated with climate change.","The species breeds in the high Arctic (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Piersma 2007, Piersma et al. 2005, Piersma and van Gils 2011) on dry upland tundra including weathered sandstone ridges, upland areas with scattered willows Salix spp., Dryas spp. and poppy, moist marshy slopes and flats in foothills, well-drained slopes hummocked with Dryas spp. (Johnsgard 1981) and upland glacial gravel close to streams or ponds (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The nest is an open shallow depression (Flint et al. 1984) either positioned on hummocks surrounded by mud and water or on stony or gravelly ground or even coastal spits (Johnsgard 1981, Lappo et al. 2012) on open vegetated tundra or stone ridges (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Outside of the breeding season the species is strictly coastal, frequenting tidal mudflats or sandflats, sandy beaches of sheltered coasts, rocky shelves, bays, lagoons and harbours, occasionally also oceanic beaches and saltmarshes (del Hoyo et al. 1996).During the breeding season it feeds predominantly on insects (mainly adult and larval Diptera, Lepidoptera, Trichoptera, Coleoptera and bees) and crustaceans and hard-shelled prey, as well as spiders, snails and worms (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Piersma et al. 2005). When it first arrives on the breeding grounds, however, the species is dependent upon vegetation (including the seeds of sedges, horsetails Equisetum spp. and grass shoots) owing to the initial lack of insect prey (Johnsgard 1981). Outside of the breeding season the species takes intertidal invertebrates such as bivalve and gastropod molluscs, crustaceans (del Hoyo et al.1996) (e.g. horseshoe crab Limulus spp. eggs) (Karpanty et al. 2006), annelid worms and insects, rarely also taking fish and seeds (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It is a full long-distance migrant that utilises few stopover sites or staging areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","Numerous threats have been identified, but the extent to which any of them are driving observed declines is unknown, with much more research needed before threats can be targeted for mitigation.Climate change has been identified for several shorebird species as a threat that is driving reduced breeding productivity by a number of mechanisms (e.g. Meltofte et al. 2007, Eikelenboom 2016, Kubelka et al. 2018); more research for this species specifically is needed.The species is exposed to additional threats on its staging and wintering grounds, particularly habitat degradation and conversion. Significant numbers of C. canutus migrate down the Yellow and East China Seas where habitat loss and hunting are plausibly significant threats. The extent of reclaimed land along the Yellow Sea coastline now exceeds the extent of remaining intertidal mudflat (Murray et al. 2014, IUCN 2023), suggesting that this may have contributed greatly to declines in this species (Melville et al. 2016). The rate of habitat lost to land reclamation has slowed since a peak in c. 2013, in particular in recent years due to the promised near-ceasing of land reclamation in China in early 2018 (Melville 2018); however, recent satellite data suggests that the extent of intertidal mudflat has continued to decrease, in large part due to continued reclamations in the Korean Peninsula (IUCN 2023). Mudflats have also continued to degrade in suitability for this species and other shorebirds because of the invasive alien Spartina alterniflora cordgrass, which appears to be spreading; in recent (post 2020) years, this threat has probably driven greater declines than planned land reclamation. In addition to land reclamation, coastal development and a rapid increase in the human population along the coastline of the Yellow Sea has led to widespread degradation of mudflats and coastal habitats used by this species; IUCN (2023) (and references therein) cite the following as additional drivers of mudflat loss and degradation: 'processes such as changes in sediment supply, loss of coastal vegetation associated with development...erosion, redistribution of sediments due to storms, and compaction and subsidence (sinking) caused by subsurface resource and groundwater extraction are also likely to be factors'. Offshore windfarms may have a so far unquantified impact on birds due to collisions (unlikely) and displacement and disturbance of feeding birds (more likely). Disturbance on mudflats by fishermen and others using the mudflats may also be reasonably considered a threat. Hunting is also possibly a significant threat impacting this and other shorebird species on passage (Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020).The species is also threatened by the over-exploitation of shellfish (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Goldfeder and Blanco 2006, van Gils et al. 2006, Kraan et al. 2010) which leads directly and indirectly to reductions in prey availability (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Piersma 2007). Across its non-breeding range the species also suffers from disturbance in the non-breeding season as a result of tourism (Goldfeder and Blanco 2006), residential development (Leyrer et al. 2014) foot-traffic on beaches (Burton et al. 2002, Niles et al. 2010, Lilleyman et al. 2016), recreational activities and over-flying aircraft, which together reduce the size of available foraging areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In the past, increased harvesting of Horseshoe Crab Limulus polyphemus in Delaware Bay, U.S.A. resulted in reduced prey availability (Baker et al. 2004, McGowan et al. 2011, Leyrer et al. 2014).","Extrapolating data from the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) surveys on the species' breeding grounds in Canada, Bart et al. (in prep.) estimated a population size of 1.2 million of islandica and rufa combined, a figure nearly 10 times higher than that calculated by Andres et al. (2012). This estimate does not include populations of islandica in northern Greenland. Taxon canutus was estimated by van Roomen et al. (2015) to number c.250,000, but was revised upwards by van Roomen et al. (2022) for the period 2016-2020 to 260,000-275,000; the latter is accepted here but may still be an underestimate based on breeding densities elsewhere (Bart et al. in prep.). Taxa piersmai and rogersi were estimated, respectively, to number 50,000-62,000 and 48,500-60,000 birds (Clemens et al. 2021), while roselaari probably numbers only c.17,000 (Andres et al. 2012). Combining all these estimates, the global population size is thought to number at least 2 million breeding birds, with an upper bound set to 3 million.",Decreasing,"The species has an extremely large range, breeding from Alaska (U.S.A.) across the Arctic to Greenland (Denmark) and northern Russia. It winters on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North and South America, north-western Europe, along the west coast of Africa from Tunisia and Morocco down to South Africa, across southern Asia and around Australasia (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996). There are six subspecies: C. c. canutus breeds in central and northern Siberia, the Taymyr Peninsula and possibly Yakutia, wintering in western and southern Africa and south Asia; C. c. piersmai breeds in the New Siberian Islands (Russia) and winters in north-west Australia; C. c. rogersi breeds on the Chukotskiy Peninsula and possibly further west, and winters in Australasia (Van Gils et al. 2017); C. c. roselaari breeds on Wrangel Island (off north-east Siberia) and north-west Alaska, wintering primarily in western Mexico, as well as the coast of south-east U.S.A., southern Panama and northern Venezuela; C. c. rufa breeds in the Canadian low Arctic and winters on the coasts of south Florida, Texas, northern Brazil (15,400 individuals [R.I.G. Morrison in litt. 2015]) and southern South America; C. c. islandica breeds on the islands of the Canadian high Arctic and north Greenland, it winters in western Europe (Van Gils and Wiersma 1996).","Hunting is a probable threat to this species in parts of its range, as the hunting of shorebirds across the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is not uncommon (see, e.g., Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020, Yong et al. 2022). The extent of hunting in the Arabian Peninsula region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet et al. 2016). Similarly, there is evidence for harvesting of shorebirds in Guyana (Andres et al. 2022), but no evidence was found for this species being targeted, or any broader quantification on the impact of shorebird hunting in the region.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayThis species is covered by the general protection regime provided by Article 1 of the European Union (EU) Birds Directive to all naturally occurring wild species in the EU, although it is also listed on Annex II/B of the Directive as a species that may be hunted in several EU Member States. It is also listed on Annex III (protected) of the pan-European Bern Convention, Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and Annex II of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). Across the EU, 251 Natura 2000 sites have been designated for the conservation of this species on passage and in winter (EEA 2024). It is included on the list of priority EU species that can benefit from a higher EU co-funding rate (up to 75%) under the LIFE Programme, although to date (June 2024) the LIFE project database does not list any projects that have taken practical conservation measures specifically for this species. Some habitats along flyway routes are protected. Active management is also underway at some Australian sites to combat cord grass invasion, as well as protective measures implemented to reduce disturbance at roost sites. The Australasian Wader Studies Group, along with BirdLife Australia's Shorebirds 2020 Project and committed volunteers continue to monitor migratory shorebirds within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (Vine and Maurer 2016). China is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to clear tidal mudflats of Spartina cordgrass, with the aim of eliminating 90% of it by 2025; locally, this has already been successful, for example at Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve (Stokstad 2023). The governments of China and South Korea have halted new projects that require or depend upon land reclamation, and across the Korean Peninsula the number of coastal wetlands has increased; moreover in China and South Korea, key areas for migratory shorebirds (including C. canutus) have been identified and prioritised by government and two World Heritage nominations have been made on these grounds (IUCN 2023). Although data on scale or impact are sparse, IUCN (2023) consider that ""support for coastal wetland conservation and wise-use appears to have increased over the last decade"". There has been a substantial increase in the number of volunteer groups and NGOs helping to monitor the migrations of shorebirds and other waterbirds, as well as increased media coverage and special events, demonstrating enhanced awareness among coastal communities (see also EAAFP 2016). North Korea became a Party to the Ramsar Convention and joined the EAAF Partnership in 2018. In 2021, the 'Regional Flyway Initiative' (RFI) was set up by the Asian Development Bank, with technical support from BirdLife International, with the aim of protecting and restoring priority wetland ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide in the East-Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), the most threatened flyway globally. The Initiative is slated for implementation in 10 East, South and South-East Asian countries: Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, all of which are used by C. canutus on northbound and southbound migrations between breeding and wintering areas, and many also for wintering. The RFI will mobilise large-scale financing to support the protection, sustainable management and restoration of at least 50 priority wetlands across ten Asian countries, with an initial financing commitment of $3 billion from the ADB (BirdLife International 2022). Over time, the RFI aims to enhance and expand the existing efforts in conserving and managing priority wetlands identified on the basis of supporting globally significant congregations of migratory waterbirds, and leverage on collaborative opportunities with stakeholders including national governments, civil society organizations, communities, regional organisations like the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership. A large portion of this species' breeding population is covered by PRISM surveys in North America, enabling regular monitoring.Conservation and Research Actions ProposedProtect key habitat across its range and ensure that the species is legally protected in all range states (Leyrer et al. 2014). Ensure sites are protected against the threats associated with oil and gas exploration. Recreation, pollution of wetland habitats, land reclamation, infrastructure development and human disturbance at key staging areas needs to be stopped. Include requirements for this species during planning for coastal development, and advocate the restoration of this species' habitat (Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2016). Shellfish fishing at wintering and stop-over habitats needs to be sustainably managed. Continue to aid in the recovery of horseshoe crab populations in Delaware Bay (Niles et al. 2010). Increase awareness of the species. Expand existing monitoring schemes and conduct research into migration patterns and requirements, ecology and threats (Niles et al. 2010, Leyrer et al. 2014, Threatened Species Scientific Committee 2016). In the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, the main action needed for this is the amelioration of threats on its migration. China needs to implement its plan to eliminate 90+% of Spartina cordgrass to prevent further loss of feeding habitat (much has already been lost to land reclamation; IUCN 2023). The discharge of toxic pollutants into coastal wetlands (especially where there are large shorebird congregations) needs to be controlled. Further degradation of mudflats needs to be stopped, including monitoring and preventing detrimental release of riverine sediments and responsible planning of offshore windfarms. Tools are available, such as AviStep (https://avistep.birdlife.org/) to ensure sustainable building of renewable energy infrastructure. Many of these threats, particularly development of coastal wetlands, apply also to the Arabian Peninsula where there is a need for sensible policy-making and implementation to reduce illegal killing and habitat loss (Brochet et al. 2016, de Fouw et al. 2018).",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

On passage, the species frequents secondary growth and forest edge. In its non-breeding range, it occupies the interior understorey of humid to semi-humid broad-leaved evergreen and semi-deciduous forest and mixed palm forest, also occurring in secondary growth, low-stature forest, thickets and plantations. It feeds mainly on soil-dwelling invertebrates, and takes fruit from late summer to early spring (Jirinec et al. 2016, Evans et al. 2020). It breeds from early May to late August, with pairs typically raising two broods. It is predominantly monogamous, with rare instances of polygyny. Pair bonds usually last for a single season. It is a long-distance nocturnal migrant, leaving its breeding areas in mid-August to mid-September and crossing the Gulf of Mexico on a broad front from Texas to Florida, and making landfall from Veracruz, Mexico to Costa Rica (del Hoyo et al. 2005, Stanley et al. 2015). Individuals leave the non-breeding region during April (Stanley et al. 2012) and most birds (&gt;70%) travel northwards through the central U.S. Gulf Coast (Stanley et al. 2015).","The species is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of its forest habitat both within the breeding and non-breeding ranges (Taylor and Stutchbury 2016, Evans et al. 2020). In fragmented habitats, breeding pairs suffer from lower reproductive success and higher prevalence of cowbird parasitism (Evans et al. 2020). Demographic models suggest that population declines are primarily driven by loss and fragmentation of non-breeding habitat in Central America (Taylor and Stutchbury 2016). Further threats include contamination by acid rain, disturbance at nest sites, pollution and window collisions (Evans et al. 2020).","The population is estimated to number 12,000,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour Most populations in warm and temperate regions are resident, often making nomadic dispersive movements according to changing water levels and seasonal rainfall (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Populations in northern Eurasia are fully migratory however, migrating on a broad front through continental Europe and across the Sahara (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Southward movements occur from mid-August to November, with the return passage occurring from late-February to May (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The species nests in dispersed solitary pairs, although it is largely gregarious with flocks (sometimes of several thousand individuals) frequently forming during the winter (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Adults undergo a post-breeding flightless moult period, with flocks of moulting birds congregating from June-September (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). The species is diurnally active and roosts at sunset solitarily or in flocks (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It may feed in flocks on land, especially when winds cause high waves on water (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat The species inhabits large, still or slow-flowing waters and shows a preference for shallow water with adjacent deeper water (e.g. &gt; 2 m) for diving, and muddy substrates, marginal, emergent, floating or submergent vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Habitats include eutrophic and mesotrophic lakes, pools, ponds, reservoirs, barrages, gravel-pits, canals, drainage ditches, dykes, oxbow lakes, fish ponds, creeks, rivers and river deltas, as well as open marshes, freshwater meadows, flood-lands, freshwater and saline lagoons, salt-pans, clay-pans and sewage ponds (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Taylor and van Perlo 1998, Musil 2006). It frequently exploits temporary pools and seasonally inundated marshes when breeding (Africa), and may extend to quiet estuaries or inshore waters in the winter (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It generally avoids closely overgrown, narrowly confined and very shallow waters, and those overshadowed by trees or cliffs (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). If solitary, the species roosts at sunset on small islets, mudbanks, sandbanks, rocks in water, floating mats of vegetation, floating logs, or branches of trees over water, preferring to roost on open water, in shore vegetation or in meadows adjacent to water if in flocks (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Diet This species is omnivorous, although its diet consists primarily of vegetable matter such as algae (e.g. Chara, Cladophora, Spirogyra), the vegetative pasts of aquatic and terrestrial plants (e.g. waterweeds, bulrushes, reeds and grasses), the seeds of waterweeds, sedges, water-lilies, grasses and cereal crops, clubmoss Selaginella and aquatic fungi (e.g. Leptomitus) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Animal matter in its diet includes molluscs, adult and larval insects (especially flies, caddisflies, Odonata, Lepidoptera, beetles and bugs), worms, leeches, shrimps, spiders, small fish, fish eggs, frogs, birds and bird eggs, and small mammals (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Breeding site The nest is a platform of vegetation that may be resting on the bottom of shallow water, floating or on a foundation of trampled plant matter in emergent vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species may also nest on artificial platforms, islands, rafts, tree stumps, tree forks or in bushes up to 3 m above the water (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Management information A study in the Czech Republic found that fish ponds with a fish stock density of less than 400 kg/ha, water transparency of more than 50 cm, mixed fish stocks (e.g. tench and pike or perch) rather than monospecific stocks (e.g. of carp), and systems that include ponds with fish fry (to provide areas with low fish competition and high invertebrate availability) are more successful in supporting breeding pairs of this species (Musil 2006). The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK (leaving small fish for piscivorous birds) resulted in increased winter use of the habitat by the species as result of an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994).","This species suffers disturbance and mortality (Azerbaijan) from hunting (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Evans and Day 2002), and is poisoned by ingesting lead shot (France) (Mondain-Monval et al. 2002). It is also threatened by oil and petroleum pollution (Azerbaijan (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and the Kaliningrad region, Russia (Grishanov 2006)), and by habitat degradation and loss due to agricultural drainage schemes (Pakistan) (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), wetland drainage, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reeds (Grishanov 2006). The species is often drowned in freshwater fishing nets with mesh sizes greater than 5 cm (China) (Quan et al. 2002), and suffers predation from American mink Neovison vison (Slonsk Reserve, Poland (Bartoszewicz and Zalewski 2003) and UK (Ferreras and MacDonald 1999)). It is also susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Utilisation The species is hunted for sport in the Mediterranean (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), Denmark (Bregnballe 2006), Northern Ireland (Evans and Day 2002) and Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006), and for food in the Mediterranean (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), Iran (Balmaki and Barati 2006), India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and neighbouring countries (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), especially when it is flightless during the post-breeding moult (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).","The global population is estimated to number c.7,950,000-9,750,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2016).

Burrows are dug for breeding under tussock grass, low scrub and on the Snares Islands under Olearia forest. Birds typically do not return to their natal colonies until the age of four. The species feeds on fish, crustacea and cephalopods, which are caught while diving. Short (1-3 days) and long (5-15 days) provisioning trips are made by parents; longer trips allow foraging along the Antarctic Polar Front, reducing competition close to breeding grounds and allowing vast colonies to persist (Weimerskirch 1998).","The species is at risk from incidental capture in longline, trawl and gill-net fisheries and suffers the additional effects of depletion of prey stocks (Uhlmann 2003). A large number of deaths occur as a result of interaction with fisheries both during the breeding season and the winter migration to the Northern Hemisphere (Uhlmann 2003). The species is also subject to direct persecution, and harvesting of young birds ('muttonbirding') currently accounts for the take of around a quarter of a million birds annually (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Heather and Robertson 1997, Newman et al. 2008, 2009), but is unlikely to account for the scale of the observed decline. Past investigation into the biological impact of climatic trends led to predictions of large-scale shifts in foraging distribution during the boreal summer and/or dramatic reductions in abundance and survival rate (Ainley et al. 1995, Veit et al. 1996, 1997, Spear and Ainley 1999, Wahl and Tweit 2000, Oedekoven et al. 2001, Hyrenbach and Veit 2003). Climate change is already affecting the foraging distribution of this species along the Californian coast (Veit et al. 1997). Evidence shows that birds are still visiting many of the same foraging areas, but are taking new routes to avoid altered current systems (Veit et al. 2003). Declines at monitored breeding sites appear to be linked to changed patterns in large scale oceanic cycles which reduce prey availability (Clucas 2011). Both Brown Rat Rattus norvegicus and House Rat R. rattus are present within the species breeding range, and although egg and chick predation by rats has been demonstrated, the extent of impact is unknown (Jones et al. 2008).","The global population totals at 4.4 million pairs, roughly equating to 19.0–23.6 million individuals (Newman et al. 2009, Waugh et al. 2013).",Decreasing,"Ardenna grisea is an abundant shearwater, breeding on islands off New Zealand, Australia and Chile, and the Falkland Islands (Malvinas). In Australia, there are colonies on 17 islands, all of which contain fewer than 1,000 pairs. In southern Chile, some colonies number up to 200,000 pairs, with the largest colony of up to 4 million individuals on Isla Guafo (Reyes-Arriagada et al. 2007). In the Falklands (Malvinas), 10,000-20,000 pairs have been recorded. New Zealand supports more than 180 colonies. The global population totals at 4.4 million pairs, roughly equating to 19.0–23.6 million individuals (Newman et al. 2009, Waugh et al. 2013). In 1970-1971, the colonies on the Snares Islands were estimated to support 2,750,000 breeding pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Heather and Robertson 1997). Although this is an extremely numerous species, there are persistent signs of a current decline (Brooke 2004). In New Zealand, the number of burrows in the largest colony on the Snares Islands declined by 37% between 1969-1971 and 1996-2000, and burrow occupancy may also have declined, indicating that an overall population decline may have occurred (Warham and Wilson 1982, Scofield and Christie 2002, Scott et al. 2008). Some colonies on mainland New Zealand have declined, and several colonies on offshore islands, especially in northern New Zealand, have not responded to predator control (Gaze 2000, Jones 2000, Waugh et al. 2013). However, other colonies in southern New Zealand have responded to sustained pest management with increasing numbers (Newman et al. 2009). The species migrates to the northern hemisphere during the austral winter (Shaffer et al. 2006, Hedd et al. 2012), and in the California Current, Sooty Shearwater numbers have fallen by 90% in the last 20 years (Veit et al. 1996). It remains uncertain whether this has resulted from population declines or distributional shifts (Spear and Ainley 1999).","",Terrestrial|Marine,Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is monitored at some sites and has been extensively studied in parts of its range.

As such it is assessed as Least Concern. Extensive monitoring across the native range is necessary for the timely detection of any potential increase in the rate of population reduction.","It is found in the temperate zone, steppe regions and open arable landscapes (Carroll et al. 2020). Its preferred habitat is open, low-intensity mixed farmland  and grasslands with small fields and hedges on grassy banks (Potts 1986, Birkan and Jacob 1988, Carroll et al. 2020). It is found in large tracts of grassland, or other ground cover that is only slightly taller than the bird itself with some dense shrubby patches at intervals such as hedgerows (Carroll et al. 2020). Given its preference of traditional agricultural practices where these hedgerows are maintained, and where pesticide use is minimal, the species can be found mostly across wheat-belts of northern Europe and North America (Carroll et al. 2020). Laying occurs from late April in the U.K., early May to June in central Europe and late May to June in Sweden with re-nesting until August or September (Carroll et al. 2020). It typically lays 15–17 eggs in the first clutch but fewer eggs when re-nesting. The nest is a shallow depression lined with plant material at the base of a hedge or other thick vegetation (Madge and McGowan 2002). It feeds on seeds of grains and weeds, cereals and clover and grass leaves as well as insects. The species is mainly sedentary however it is partially migratory in eastern Europe and performs altitudinal migration in the Caucasus moving to the foothills in October and November (Carroll et al. 2020).","In Europe since the early part of the 20th century, the species may have declined in all 31 countries in which it is found. In the U.K., the reduction in numbers is believed to be as high as 80%; causes probably include factors such as loss of nesting cover, predation, herbicides (chick survival rates in U.K. declined from 49% to 32% once their use became widespread) and pesticides that reduce insect abundance in the spring. All of these factors are the consequences of intensification of agricultural practices (Carroll et al. 2020), causing significant stressors despite the species' adaptability to agricultural habitats. Abandoning low-intensive agriculture, and therefore rewilding areas are also known to cause local declines (Novoa et al. 2002). The species is also hunted in many parts of Europe and is considered an economically important gamebird (Carroll et al. 2020). Changes in weather patterns may also have a significant impact on numbers (such as severe winters causing increased mortality; Potts 1986, Panek 1990, Carroll et al. 2020); exact extent of impacts are however currently unknown.","The European breeding population is estimated to be 1,140,000-1,880,000 pairs, which equates to 2,290,000-3,750,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2021). The European estimate covers approximately 70% of the global range, so a preliminary estimate of the global population size is 3,300,000-5,300,000 mature individuals. The introduced, non-native population in the U.S. is now estimated at 820,000 individuals (Partners in Flight 2021).",Decreasing,"The species occurs throughout much of the western Palearctic, with a native range encompassing Portugal, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Italy, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Romania, Moldova, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece, Türkiye, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan and China (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Carroll et al. 2020). The subspecies italica, endemic to parts of Italy, has been extinct since the 1980s as a result of hybridisation with introduced individuals of the nominate subspecies (Liukkonen-Anttila et al. 2002). Other subspecies (in addition to nominate subspecies perdix) include sphagnetorum (found in Netherlands and Germany), armoricana (found across areas of France), hispaniensis (occurring in Portugal and Spain), lucida (from Finland to Russia, the Black Sea, and Northern Caucasus), robusta (parts of Russia, to Kazakhastan, Siberia, and even Northwestern China), and canescens (occurring from Türkiye and the Caucasus to Iran) (Carrol et al. 2020).","Harvest numbers exist for parts of the species' range. In Europe, annual harvests of 2,150,000 individuals were estimated for France, 100,000 for Britain, and 100,000 for Poland (Potts 1986). The non-native population in North America also supports a considerable hunting offtake: during 1986-1988 in Northern Dakota, annual harvests were estimated to be c. 146,000 individuals, whilst in Saskatchewan 91,600 individuals were harvested, and 91,100 in Iowa (Vander Zouwen 1990a).",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayMace Lande: Safe.

In the U.K., supplementary winter feeding is also being attempted to benefit this, and other declining granivorous birds, on farmland (Carroll et al. 2020). Reintroduction programmed in the U.K. have not been significantly successful however (Vinicombe et al. 1993).

Population declines have also been attributed to loss of suitable habitat through overgrazing or conversion of native grassland into cultivated farmland, insensitive management, and increased tourism disturbing nest sites (Konrad et al. 2020). Predation by Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) is also a threat (Mebs and Schmidt 2006). In North America, falconers harvest a small number of Merlins each year, but this is carefully regulated and is unlikely to have a significant effect on populations (Millsap and Allen 2006).

It breeds in dense colonies with other terns or Black-headed Gulls Larus ridibundus and is gregarious throughout the year, often forming feeding flocks where prey is abundant or concentrated (although it may also feed solitarily) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding During the breeding season the species forms colonies on sandy islands, rocky calcareous islets, sand-spits, sand-dunes, shingle beaches and extensive deltas with immediate access to clear waters with shallow sandy substrates rich in surface-level fish (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for raised, open, unvegetated sand, gravel, mud or bare coral substrates for nesting (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species frequents sandy or rocky beaches, mudflats fringed by mangroves, estuaries, harbours and bays, often feeding over inlets and at sea (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of surface-dwelling marine fish 9-15 cm long as well as small shrimps, marine worms and shorebird nestlings (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding site The nest is a shallow scrape on raised, open, unvegetated sand, gravel, mud or bare coral substrates preferably far from upright vegetation on sandy islands, rocky calcareous islets, sand-spits, sand-dunes and shingle beaches (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species forms very dense colonies during the breeding season in which the eggs of neighbouring pairs may only be 20 cm apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Management information The species responds favourably to habitat management such as vegetation clearance, and can be readily attracted to suitable nesting habitats by the use of decoys (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding pairs are also known to be attracted to coastal locations where artificial nesting sites have been constructed (e.g. beaches of bare shingle and islands or rafts covered with sparse vegetation) (Burgess and Hirons 1992). A conservation scheme for the protection of gull and tern breeding colonies in coastal lagoons and deltas (e.g. Po Delta, Italy) involves protection from human disturbance, prevention of erosion of islet complexes, habitat maintenance and the creation of new islets for nest sites (Fasola and Canova 1996). The scheme particularly specifies that bare islets with 30-100 % cover of low vegetation (sward heights less than 20 cm) should be maintained or created as nesting sites (Fasola and Canova 1996).","As only a few colonies exist each year, this tern is highly vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbance (Garthe and Flore 2007) and is known to abandon eggs en masse (Gochfield et al. 2018).

Further south, populations tend to be sedentary or only partially migratory. Most migratory movements occur nocturnally, with birds moving in small parties or larger flocks of 200-250 (Brown et al. 1982). The species breeds January-May in the Palearctic Region, and in spring and summer in temperate areas, but mainly during the rains in Africa and the tropics (although here it may also breed in any month of the year) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It breeds in mixed colonies of hundreds or thousands of pairs (the largest colony in Europe is 800-1,300 pairs), although it may also nest solitarily or in small groups of 2-10 nests (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is typically a solitary feeder but at abundant temporary food sources, or where available feeding areas are restricted, large congregations may occur (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It feeds at any time day or night, but is most active at dawn or dusk, typically roosting communally or solitary during the middle of the day and at night in trees and on cliffs, low rocks, islets or along shores (Brown et al. 1982, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Habitat This species is a generalist in its habitat use, although shallow water, relatively large prey, and four or five months of ice-free breeding season are among the essential characteristics of its habitat (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occurs from sea-level up to 500 or even 1,000 m, occasionally breeding much higher (Snow and Perrins 1998) (2,000 m in Armenia, 3,500-4,000 m in Ladakh, north-west India), inhabits any kind of shallow water, either fresh, brackish or saline, both standing or flowing, and shows a preference for areas with trees as it is commonly an arboreal rooster and nester. Some degree of isolation and protection are also typical of places chosen for roosting and nesting (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is found inland on broad rivers, narrow streams, lake shores, ornamental ponds, fish-ponds, marshes, flood-plains, reeds swamps, rice-fields and other irrigated areas, river oxbows, reservoirs, ditches, canals, sewage farms, inland deltas, and on islets and emerging rocks (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). On the coast the species also frequents deltas, salt-marshes, mangroves, estuaries, tidal mudflats, muddy and sandy shores, and sand-spits (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of fish and eels 10-25 cm long, as well as amphibians, crabs, molluscs, crustaceans, aquatic insects, snakes, small rodents, small birds and plant matter (although this may be incidental, or only to aid in pellet formation) (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Breeding site The nest is a stick platform that is often re-used over successive years, usually positioned high in a tall tree up to 50 m, but also on the ground or on cliff edges, in reedbeds or in bushes. In reed-beds nests may be built of reeds, and ground nests may be reduced to a slight scrape, ringed with small stones and debris (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species commonly nests in colonies, and nesting sites are typically situated 2-38 km (convenient flying distance) from preferred feeding areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","In Europe, the species was heavily persecuted in the nineteenth century due to its consumption of fish, which resulted in competition with fishermen and fish farmers (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Although killing at aquaculture farms has not reduced the global population so far (possibly because it is young birds that are mostly killed), 800 individuals are estimated to have died per year at Scottish fish-farms between 1984 and 1987 by being shot, drowned or poisoned by fish farmers (Carss 1994, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Renewed hunting poses a threat to populations in Bavaria (Germany) by decreasing numbers to levels that inhibit recovery following severe winters (severe winters increase mortality rates for juveniles) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is vulnerable in Madagascar owing to its restricted range, exceedingly high levels of habitat alteration (from siltation and the need for agricultural land for rice and grazing), hunting, and predation at nesting colonies (Kushlan and Hafner 2000, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Timber harvesting is a threat throughout much of the species's range by removing trees used by nesting colonies and/or disturbing nearby colonies (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and avian botulism (van Heerden 1974), so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases. Utilisation The species is hunted and traded at traditional medicine markets in Nigeria (Nikolaus 2001).","The global population is estimated to number c.790,000-3,700,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). This roughly equates to 500,000-2,500,000 mature individuals. The European population is estimated at 223,000-391,000 pairs, which equates to 447,000-782,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). National population estimates include 100,000-1 million breeding pairs and &gt; 10,000 individuals on migration in China; 100-10,000 breeding pairs and 1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in Korea; 100,000-1 million breeding pairs and &gt; 10,000 wintering individuals in Japan; and 100,000-1 million breeding pairs and &gt; 10,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Unknown,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is not listed on priority lists of the Conventions. Conservation Actions ProposedThe following information refers to the species's European range only: Freshwater habitats need to be sustainably managed.

154671400,22693369,Calidris alba,Least Concern,,2024,2024-07-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has a very large geographic range size (extent of occurrence &gt;13 million km2 in both the breeding and non-breeding seasons), and so does not approach Criterion B thresholds. It also has a large estimated population size (900,000 to 1,200,000 mature individuals), and so does not approach Criteria C or D thresholds. Although the data presented in Smith et al. (2023) indicate rapid declines exceeding 40% over three generations (c. 19 years), other populations are evidently not declining as rapidly. In the East Atlantic Flyway (including Western Europe), van Roomen et al. (2022) recorded an increase in abundance between 1979 and 2020, while the trend of birds wintering in SW Asia, Eastern and Southern Africa appears relatively stable (Nagy and Langendoen 2020). These latter trends represent a majority of the species' global range. Moreover, the data in Smith et al. are presented with significant bounds of uncertainty, and eBird data (Fink et al. 2023) suggest, in contrast to Smith et al., a stable population trend. Collating all available data, the global population of this species is estimated to have declined by 0-19% over the past three generations. Although the population is declining, it does not currently appear to be declining at a rate approaching Criterion A thresholds. Hence, the species continues to warrant listing as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is a full long-distance migrant that travels mainly via offshore and coastal routes using a number of favoured stopover sites (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It breeds from June to mid-July in solitary pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996), departing the breeding grounds between mid-July and early-September (Hayman et al. 1986). The species usually occurs in small flocks on migration (Johnsgard 1981) although it may aggregate into larger flocks at stopover sites (Hayman et al. 1986), and in winter it forages in small to very large flocks (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding The species breeds in the high Arctic on barren, stony tundra with well-drained ridges (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996), gentle slopes or level alluvial plains supporting scattered vegetation of willow Salix spp., Dryas spp. and saxifrage Saxifraga spp. usually less than 200 m above sea-level (Johnsgard 1981). Non-breeding On passage the species may occur on inland freshwater or saline lakes (del Hoyo et al. 1996) but it is largely coastal during the winter, inhabiting open sandy beaches exposed to the sea, the outer reaches of estuaries, rocky and muddy shores, mudflats (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and coral reefs (Urban et al. 1986). Diet Breeding When breeding the species takes insects (especially adult and larval Diptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera) as well as spiders and crustaceans (del Hoyo et al. 1996). On arrival on the breeding grounds the species may also complement its diet with plant matter (e.g. seeds, saxifrage buds, moss and algae) (del Hoyo et al. 1996) before invertebrate prey becomes available (Johnsgard 1981). Non-breeding During the winter its diet consists of small molluscs, crustaceans, polychaete worms and adult, larval and pupal insects (e.g. Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hemiptera and Hymenoptera), as well as occasionally fish and carrion (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression on the bare earth (del Hoyo et al. 1996) of stony well-drained ridges, gentle slope or level alluvial plains (Johnsgard 1981).","Species is threatened by pollution, which alongside other anthropogenic threats at wintering and migratory stopover sites are thought to have been the cause of significant declines over the past 30 years. Oil pollution is particularly concerning due to frequent offshore petroleum activities, consistent small-scale spills, and potential long-term sublethal effects. These factors pose a serious threat to shorebird habitats (Labarrère, 2016). The extensive time that C. alba spends in marine environments heightens its susceptibility to oil spills, which disrupt both foraging and migration behaviours. Climate change poses another significant threat. A 17-year study focusing on C. alba breeding in Greenland (Reneerkens et al. 2016) highlighted that a substantial portion of the population depends heavily on the Wadden Sea during migration (Loonstra et al. 2016; Reneerkens et al. 2020). Over this period, the emergence of crucial food sources such as insects and spiders has shifted earlier due to earlier snow melt. However, the birds have not adjusted their breeding timing accordingly, leading to a phenological mismatch. This mismatch results in a critical misalignment between the peak food demand of C. alba chicks and the availability of sufficient food resources. Predicted increases in temperature due to climate change may also eliminate almost all nesting habitat and alter topography at such a rate that invertebrate prey will be negatively impacted (Myers 1988). Habitat degradation due to urban development and wetland loss further compounds these challenges, particularly in key staging areas like Delaware and Chesapeake Bays (Macwhirter et al. 2020). Disturbance poses a threat as they inhabit shoreline habitats extensively used by humans for recreation. Activities such as beach recreation can disrupt the species ability to forage and rest. The intensity of human disturbance varies across different sites and times of the year but is widespread and chronic in heavily populated areas. Off-road vehicles, pedestrians, and especially unleashed dogs often disturb the species (Thomas et al. 2003). While individual incidents may seem minor, the cumulative impact of continuous human disturbances compromises the quality of the species feeding and resting sites (Payne 2010).The species is also susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). In the Chinese, North Korean and South Korean regions of the Yellow Sea (East Asian flyway route) this species is threatened by the degradation and loss of wetland habitats through environmental pollution, reduced river flows and human disturbance (Kelin and Qiang 2006).","Population size very large. Bart et al. (in prep.) estimated a total of c.700,000 breeding adults in Arctic Canada, which is thought to comprise the majority of the global population. An additional population of at least 200,000 breeding individuals is suspected by summing populations from elsewhere (based on data collated by Wetlands International [2023]). The global population is therefore suspected to number 900,000-1,200,000 to account for uncertainty over the population size of birds in Siberia. The population size of birds using the East Asian-Australasian Flyway was estimated at 30,000 (Hansen et al. 2022).",Decreasing,"Breeds on high-arctic tundra including in Arctic Canada (which hosts majority of global population), northernmost Alaska (USA), Greenland, Norway and Siberian Russia. In winter can be found in suitable habitat almost anywhere in the world!","Subsistence hunting in south of U.S may be an issue but the extent and effects of this are unknown (Macwhirter et al. 2020). Similarly, there is evidence for harvesting of shorebirds, including this species, in Guyana (Andres et al. 2022) but there is no quantified data on the extent or impact of hunting in the Americas. Hunting probably affects this species along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, where trapping birds with nets along coastlines is commonplace (Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020, Yong et al. 2022).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed in Annex II of CMS. It is not listed on the annexes of the European Union (EU) Birds Directive, but is covered by the general protection regime provided by Article 1 of the Directive to all naturally occurring wild species in the EU. In 2021, the 'Regional Flyway Initiative' (RFI) was set up by the Asian Development Bank, with technical support from BirdLife International, with the aim of protecting and restoring priority wetland ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide in the East-Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), the most threatened flyway globally. The Initiative is slated for implementation in 10 East, South and South-East Asian countries: Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, all of which are used by C. alba on northbound and southbound migrations between breeding and wintering areas, and many also for wintering. The RFI will mobilise large-scale financing to support the protection, sustainable management and restoration of at least 50 priority wetlands across ten Asian countries, with an initial financing commitment of $3 billion from the ADB (BirdLife International 2022). Over time, the RFI aims to enhance and expand the existing efforts in conserving and managing priority wetlands identified on the basis of supporting globally significant congregations of migratory waterbirds, and leverage on collaborative opportunities with stakeholders including national governments, civil society organizations, communities, regional organisations like the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour Most populations are migratory and dispersive and abandon their breeding sites at the end of the breeding season to overwinter at sea (Higgins and Davies 1996, Haney et al. 1999). Its detailed migratory movements are largely unknown however, and some populations in the Indian Ocean are entirely sedentary or only partially migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Haney et al. 1999). The timing of breeding varies geographically, most populations breeding annually in groups of 2-30 pairs (sometimes up to 400-2,000 pairs) that are not strictly colonial but involve solitary pairs congregating in suitable habitat (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Haney et al. 1999). When nesting the species often associates with nesting Sooty Tern (Onychoprion fuscatus) or Greater Crested Tern (Thalasseus bergii) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). After breeding, the adults and newly fledged young leave the breeding colonies in loose flocks and migrate alone, in small groups of 10-12 individuals or more rarely in larger groups of up to 200 individuals (Higgins and Davies 1996, Haney et al. 1999). Outside of the breeding season, the species is thought to occur singly (Higgins and Davies 1996). Habitat The species inhabits offshore tropical and subtropical seas (Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding It breeds on the periphery of vegetated coastal and continental coral, rock or rubble islands and beaches, volcanic stacks and exposed reefs, foraging inshore and up to 50 km offshore (although mostly within 15 km of land) and feeding from the surface of the water or up to 20 cm below it (Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Haney et al. 1999). Non-breeding Away from the breeding grounds, the species is entirely pelagic and often associates with patches of macroalgae (e.g. Sargassum spp.) or flotsam which it uses for perching (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Haney et al. 1999). Its marine distribution is therefore linked to small- and medium-scale oceanographic features where water circulation aggregates such floating matter into patches (Haney et al. 1999). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of squid and surface-schooling fish less than 6 cm long as well as crustaceans and occasionally aquatic insects or molluscs (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). Breeding site The nest is a scrape or depression in shingle or sand that may be freshly excavated or re-used from a previous season (Higgins and Davies 1996). Nests are placed in a variety of concealed locations around the rim of oceanic islands (del Hoyo et al. 1996), including natural cavities amongst rocks or coral rubble, in vegetation (up to 75 % ground cover), in a crevice or cave up to 1.5 m deep, under a cliff ledge or on the ground beneath low bushes or shrubs (Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species is not strictly colonial but solitary pairs usually congregate in suitable habitats with neighbouring nests spaced according to nest-site availability (usually 1-5 m apart, minimum 30 cm) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Haney et al. 1999). Management information The species will become habituated to human presence in sites exposed to long term visitation, especially where human movements are predictable, groups sizes are kept consistent and human behaviour is reliable (Haney et al. 1999). Additional measures to reduce human disturbance of nesting colonies includes the erection of barriers and signs, the provision of walkways, and the supervision and education of visitors (Haney et al. 1999).","Bridled Tern is known to have abandoned breeding colonies when subject to severe human disturbance, although at sites exposed to long-term visitation it may become habituated to continuous and predictable human presence and activity (Haney et al. 1999). Eggs are harvested for subsistence in the Bahamas and the West Indies, and eggs and chicks are harvested on some islands in the Pacific by local residents and coastal shipping crews (Haney et al. 1999). Neither of these are considered to represent a significant threat to the population.","The global population is estimated to number 610,000-1,500,000 individuals (Delany and Scott 2006). This roughly equates to 400,000-1,000,000 mature individuals.

Its nest is usually a shallow depression, often on a stony riverbed, and there are usually four eggs in a clutch. In the non-breeding season it is found on sheltered coasts with reefs and rock platforms or with intertidal mudflats, as well as shorelines with rocks, shingle, gravel or shells, often roosting in mangroves.

On its breeding grounds, it feeds mainly on insects, with its diet in the non-breeding season largely comprising crabs, along with other crustaceans, polychaetes, molluscs, insects and occasionally fish (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","Previously the main threats at stopover sites and on the wintering grounds were the loss and degradation of wetlands, including from pollution, reclamation, and urban and industrial expansion, as well as disturbance and hunting (Garnett et al. 2011). However, in Australia there are no major threats with most birds spending the non-breeding season along sparsely populated coasts (Clemens et al. 2021).

The current rate of decline is thought to represent a minor improvement on that over the past three generations but remains very rapid and it still qualifies at the level of Endangered based on the estimated/projected current and future three-generation rate of population reduction. A number of factors are driving the decline, including habitat loss in its breeding, passage and wintering grounds, compounded by disturbance, pollution, and the effects of climate change, however the impact of indiscriminate shorebird hunting appears to be the most immediate and severe threat. Juvenile recruitment has, until recently, been very low, leading to fears that the population is ageing rapidly. Extensive conservation work has likely driven the slowing rate of decline, but much more work is required to prevent the extinction of this species.","The species has a very specialised breeding habitat, using only lagoon spits with crowberry-lichen vegetation or dwarf birch and willow sedges near lakes and marshes, together with adjacent estuary and mudflat habitats that are used as feeding sites by adults during nesting. It may also use stream-deposited gravel pits (Van Gils et al. 2020). The species has never been recorded breeding further than 5 km (and exceptionally once 7 km) from the sea shore. Breeding birds are very site-faithful. It breeds either in single pairs or loose aggregations (Zöckler et al. 2008). It nests in June-July (Tomkovich 1992, 1995, Van Gils et al. 2020), with failed breeders potentially leaving on migration before others (Zhang Lin 2016). During winter, it prefers mixed sandy tidal mudflats with an uneven surface and very shallow water, mainly in the outermost parts of river deltas and outer islands, often with a higher sand content and thin mud layer on top. In the areas with total coastal conversion, it favours certain stages in the management of saltpans (Zöckler et al. 2008). The species uses a variety of feeding techniques that includes a larger variety of food items across the range, including terrestrial insects, small seeds, larvae of beetles and small aquatic amphipods (Kelly et al. 2018, Van Gils et al. 2020). Evidence to support suspicions that immature birds spend their first summer on the wintering grounds until their second year come from ringing recoveries (Tomkovich 1995, Zöckler et al. 2010a), photographs of a second calendar-year bird in Thailand in July 2010 (G. Chutima in litt. 2010) and another individual in Bangladesh in June 2015 (S. U. Chowdhury in litt. 2016), as well as oversummering and passage birds in the Rudong mudflats (Clark et al. 2018, Zhang et al. 2019).  ","Throughout its migratory and wintering ranges, tidal flats are being reclaimed for coastal development (industry, leisure, infrastructure, aquaculture and agriculture) and are becoming increasingly polluted. The important staging area at Saemangeum and Geum estuary, South Korea, including the Mangyeung and Tongjin estuaries, has already been reclaimed, and remaining wetlands are under serious threat of reclamation in the near future (Zöckler et al. 2008). Since the reclamation at Saemangeum in 2007, only an average of a single individual has been recorded, in contrast to 'hundreds' prior to the development (Lee et al. 2018). Plans for a large-scale reclamation project on the Tiaozini Sandbanks, (part of the Rudong mudflats) were feared to threatened over 60,000 ha of mudflats used by the species by 2020 (Moores 2015, J. Li and M. Tong to C. Zöckler in litt. 2016, Peng et al. 2017), and elsewhere at Rudong new seawalls were being built in 2015 (Zöckler 2015, Peng et al. 2017). However, the national announcement of an end to the reclamation of intertidal land in January 2018 (Anon. 2018, Lei 2018) appears to be a dramatic shift towards alleviating new impacts from this threat and these sites are included in the World Heritage Site nomination.Smooth Cord-grass Spartina alterniflora is an invasive plant used to stabilise mudflats to assist in reclamation along the Chinese coast and rapidly leaves intertidal areas unsuitable for Spoon-billed Sandpipers, dramatically reducing habitat availability (Menxiu et al. 2012, Peng et al. 2017). At both Rudong and Dongling, Spartina alterniflora has formed dense stands with considerable spread noted between spring 2014 and autumn 2015 (Peng et al. 2017), and it has also been found on Leizhou mudflat (V. Fu in litt. 2017). The Rudong mudflats are also the site for development of the largest wind farm in Asia, which could prove to be another threat to this species (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010, Li et al. undated). Plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia and cross-dams along the coast of Bangladesh continue to pose threats (Bird et al. 2010a, Chowdhury et al. 2011, Zöckler 2015); however, this plan is currently on hold and plans to protect the area have been developed (Zöckler 2015).Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Myanmar (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, Zöckler and Htin Hla 2009, Bird et al. 2010b, Chowdhury 2010, C. Zöckler in litt. 2010, Zöckler et al. 2010b, Martinez &amp; Lewthaithe 2013), and this may be a particularly serious threat to birds wintering on Nan Thar Island and in the Gulf of Martaban, Myanmar (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010, Zöckler et al. 2010b). A survey of hunting activities in five villages around Sonadia Island, Bangladesh, in September 2010 found that of the 53 hunters interviewed, eight of them claimed to have caught a total of 22 Spoon-billed Sandpipers between October 2009 and April 2010 (Chowdhury 2010). Hunting in the species's non-breeding range could be a crucial factor in the poor rate of recruitment into the breeding population, as immature birds do not return to the breeding areas until they are two years old and thus are more exposed to capture (Zöckler et al. 2010b). However, recent conservation action aimed at reducing trapping on the wintering grounds appears to have been successful (Clark et al. 2014) and may have reduced this significant source of mortality (D. Pain in litt. 2016, Aung et al. 2016/2017). Large-scale wader trapping was observed at Fucheng, south-west Guangdong province, China, where four Spoon-billed Sandpiper were observed in December 2012 (BirdLife Asia 2013), but surveys for the species in south China in January 2017 did not find any illegal mist nets (V. Fu in litt. 2017). Monofilament fishing nets set over high tides were found to be a serious problem on the central Chinese coast, with multiple parallel lines of nets set at Tiaozini in autumn 2015 were found to have captured scores of birds after just one nocturnal high tide, including one juvenile Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Peng et al. 2017). Hunting with nets has also been reported from Viet Nam (Long 2015). Recently the scale of hunting in the Russian far northeast has been found to be much greater than previously assumed, and may impact the species during the immediate post-breeding period particularly.Between August and October 2014, more than a thousand dead wading birds, including two Spoon-billed Sandpipers, were found on the Tiaozini Sandbanks (Zöckler et al. 2015, Peng et al. 2017). Tests are ongoing to understand the cause of mortality; however, poisoned bait was discovered in the area.There are no immediate threats to the breeding grounds, but nests in the vicinity of villages are sometimes destroyed by dogs (E. Syroechkovskiy in litt. 2007). Poor breeding productivity in recent years has been attributed to heavy nest predation and bad weather (Syroechkovskiy et al. 2009). Significant habitat degradation has been observed in 5 of 30 visited breeding locations (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010). Human disturbance, both by residents and researchers, may cause increased levels of nest desertion and predation by foxes and skuas (Zöckler &amp; Bunting 2006). Shorebirds, including this species, are also occasionally killed by children with slingshots (Zöckler &amp; Bunting 2006); one male was also shot by a Russian hunter near the Chinese border in 2008 (Zöckler &amp; Syroechkovskiy 2008). Small but significant numbers of birds and their eggs have been collected for scientific purposes in the last 20 years, with one small colony completely wiped out due to this activity (Syroechkovsky 2005). Climate change and associated habitat shifts are expected to impact negatively on this species and other species dependent on tundra habitat for breeding. Modelling indicates that 57% of the breeding habitat for this species could be lost by 2070 (Zöckler &amp; Lysenko 2000). Recent observation on the breeding grounds unfortunately confirm a worrying trend of increasing bushes intruding on the coastal tundra habitats in the southern range, as well as drying of the tundra in the northern range with significant consequences on food access for breeding waders (C. Zöckler in litt. 2020)","A total of ten repeats of a Lincoln-Peterson method to estimate the global population have resulted in a weighted mean single global estimate of 490 mature individuals (95% confidence limits 360-620) for the six-year period between 2014-2019 (Green et al. 2021). However, the most recent winter counts suggest a total number of birds in the order of 330-340 individuals (Zöckler et al. 2021), indicating that the total of mature individuals may actually already have fallen below 250 if we assume fewer than three-quarters of these are mature individuals. As such the population is placed within a custom band of 240-620 mature individuals, with a best single value of 490 (Green et al. 2021) but noting that this figure may already be outdated.The trend of these estimates, albeit over a short-time frame, was a mean rate of reduction of 8% (Green et al. 2021), similar to the 9% estimated from surveys of the most important wintering population in Myanmar (Zöckler et al. 2010a). However, the confidence interval of the more recent trend estimates overlapped zero, such that there is low confidence in the accuracy of the trend magnitude. In the absence of better information, and noting the congruence with the rate of reduction estimated from wintering surveys, this rate of decline is taken to be the best estimate for the population as a whole for the current timeframe. This rate of reduction is equivalent (using an exponential model of decline) to a three-generation reduction of 68% (over 13.4 years), estimated as a rate of continuing decline of 31.5% in one generation (4.5 years) and 52.7% in two generations (9 years). However, prior to 2009 the rate of population reduction, based on counts of breeding pairs at surveyed locations, was reported to be extremely rapid at an annual rate of 26% between 2002-2008 (Zöckler et al. 2010a). As such, the past rate of reduction for the most recent three-generation period (2007-2021) is suspected to have been at a higher rate, and, given the uncertainty, is placed in a band of 70-80%.",Decreasing,"This species has a naturally limited breeding range on the Chukotsk peninsula and southwards to the isthmus of the Kamchatka peninsula, in north-eastern Russia (BirdLife International 2001, Zoeckler &amp; Lappo 2008). It migrates down the western Pacific coast through Russia, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, mainland China, Hong Kong (China), Taiwan (China) and Viet Nam, to its main wintering grounds in southern China, Viet Nam, Thailand, Bangladesh and Myanmar (Zöckler et al. 2016). It is a vagrant visitor in Cambodia and Indonesia (during non-breeding seasons here particularly; C. Zöckler in litt. 2020). Wintering birds have also been recorded from India (with a recent sighting in 2018 possibly the first for 14 years [Roy 2018]), Sri Lanka, the Fujian province in China (the Min Jiang estuary in Fujian has recently been identified as an important wintering site for the species [F. Cheung in litt. 2010, Bai et al. 2015, Zöckler et al. 2016]), Guangdong and Guangxi provinces of China ((Martinez &amp; Lewthwaite 2013, Fu 2015), and peninsular Malaysia. It occurs regularly at only a few sites within this wintering range, with important sites in Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar and China. Sonadia Island and Meghna Estuary (Bangladesh), the Gulf of Martaban and Nan Thar (Myanmar) were believed to support over half of the wintering population (Zöckler et al. 2010b, Zöckler et al. 2014, Zöckler et al. 2016, Chowdhury et al. 2018); over 80% of the entire population were considered to winter in Myanmar and Bangladesh (Zöckler et al. 2016). However, recent surveys show that the Southern China coast in Guandong and Guanxi Provinces also host significant numbers (Martinez &amp; Allcock 2016) and that the numbers in Bangladesh and Myanmar are falling more rapidly than at sites further north along the migratory route (Zöckler et al. 2021). It seems likely that the bulk of the population now winters along the Chinese coast.Records of wintering birds in Myanmar are of 84 individuals in 2008, 73 in January 2009, and 89 in 2010 (Zöckler et al. 2010b); 150-220 in the Bay of Martaban in 2010-2012 (Zöckler et al. 2010a, b, 2014) and approximately 155 in the upper bay of Martaban in January 2015 (Clark 2015). In 2016, an estimated 100-112 individuals were present in the upper Gulf of Mottama, Myanmar (Aung et al. 2016, 2020), a reduction from 244 individuals observed in 2009 (Aung et al. 2020). Recent counts reinforce this rapid reduction, with only 47 individuals counted in January 2021 despite high coverage (Zöckler et al. 2021).In March-April 2010, a minimum total of 49 individuals were recorded during targeted surveys along the coast of Bangladesh (Bird et al. 2010, Chowdhury et al. 2011). A new site along the Meghna Estuary was discovered in 2015, which supported a minimum of 48 individuals in February 2016 (Chowdhury et al. 2018). Surveys along the Bangladesh coast from December 2015 to February 2016 found a record number of a minimum of 76 individuals from different sites along the coast, the highest numbers recorded since 1989 in Bangladesh (Chowdhury 2016). However since 2016 numbers located in Bangladesh in winter have fallen rapidly, with fewer than ten counted in January 2021 (Zöckler et al. 2021).During the winter of 2015-2016, it was estimated that 10 adults used the Gulf of Thailand (K. Sutasha in litt. 2016). China Coastal Waterbird Surveys conducted between 2005 and 2013 (Bai et al. 2015) identified the following sites as of international importance for the species: Yalu Jliang estuarine wetland (Liaoning), Rudong coast (Jiangsu), Dongtai coast (Jiangsu), Dongling coast (Jiangsu), Minjiang Estuary National Nature Reserve (Fujian), Dadeng Island and Weitou Bay (Fujian) and Xitou coast (Guangdong). A total of 61 individuals was recorded wintering in southern China (present at ten of 36 surveyed sites) in the January 2021 coordinated surveys (Qing/Spoon-billed Sandpiper Alliance 2021). The Leizhou Peninsula has been identified as an important area, holding about 50 birds (Martinez &amp; Allcock 2016, C. Zöckler in litt. 2016): 33 were counted in January 2021 (Qing/Spoon-billed Sandpiper Alliance 2021). China is of primary importance during post-breeding and migration periods. It is likely that a large proportion of the adult population of the species spends time at Rudong, China, in both autumn and spring (Menxiu et al. 2012, Clark et al. 2014). It is currently the only known moulting site for the species (Bai et al. 2015, Peng et al. 2017). Counts of up to 103 individuals at Rudong in October 2011, 106 in October 2012, 140 in October 2013 (Zöckler and Li 2013), a minimum of 226 in September 2014 and 177-190 in October 2014 (Zöckler et al. 2015) are likely to have accounted for a substantial proportion of the global population (M. Tong in litt. 2011). A maximum of 100 birds were recorded on the Tiaozini mudflats (part of the Rudong mudflats), Dongtai County, in October 2014 (Zöckler et al. 2015), with more than 100 birds recorded at Tiaozini in October 2015 (Li and Chowdhury 2016). A survey in May 2015 on the Rudong mudflats recorded at least 62 individuals, including a number of head-started birds (Phillips 2015). Modelling work has shown Rudong to be too far for the species to reach in a single flight from its breeding grounds and work is underway to identify another stopover site in the Russian Far East (Clark et al. 2014).Due to its specialised breeding habitat requirements, it was probably always a scarce species, but numbers dropped rapidly, at least between 2000 and 2010 (D. Pain in litt. 2016). Surveys on the breeding grounds revealed a dramatic decline from 2,000-2,800 pairs in the 1970s (which assumes equal distribution of the species and may have potentially excluded unknown sites; C. Zöckler in litt. 2019) to fewer than 1,000 pairs in 2000, 402-572 pairs in 2003, 350-380 pairs in 2005 (Zöckler &amp; Bunting 2006) and not more than 150-320 pairs in 2008. The breeding population in 2009-2010 was optimistically estimated at 120-200 pairs (Bird et al. 2010, Zöckler et al. 2010a) in an estimated total population of 500-800 individuals, perhaps indicating an 88% decline since 2002, equating to an annual rate of decline of 26% (Zöckler et al. 2010a). These declines have taken place across all known breeding sites, and it is unlikely that significant colonies remain undiscovered (Zöckler 2005, Zöckler &amp; Bunting 2006). Declines were also observed at wintering grounds. For example, no birds were sighted wintering in Viet Nam in 2009 at a site that supported at least 27 birds in the mid 1990s (E. Syroechkovskiy et al. in litt. 2009). However, over the last few years (2013-2015), there are signs that active conservation interventions may have stemmed this rapid population decline and the small remaining population appears decline at a slower pace of still 8-10% (Aung et al. 2018, Aung et al. 2020).Breeding success is quite low: average productivity was 0.66 young fledged per nest in 2005, and much lower in 2007, and this is compounded by a very low rate of juveniles and adults returning to the breeding grounds. Until recently, the species has had an ageing and rapidly declining population with little recruitment (Zöckler et al. 2010). For example, data collected on birds at one breeding area from 2003 to 2009 suggest that recruitment into the adult breeding population was effectively zero in all years apart from 2005 and 2007 (Zöckler et al. 2010a). In 2013, for the first time there was no decline detected at the core breeding area of Meinypylgino, where the population was stable at c.10 pairs (Zöckler 2013). In June 2014, an expedition to Russkaya Koshka recorded an increase in the number of breeding territories recovering from a low of 1-2 pairs in previous years (Nitschke et al. 2015), but numbers are still not near levels known from the early 2000s (Tomkovich et al. 2002, C. Zöckler in litt. 2016). In July 2011 and 2016, an expedition in Kamchatka located each a previously unknown breeding area for the species (Heritage Expeditions 2016), with around 3 pairs each. ","Although not specifically targeted, the species is regularly caught in nets set to catch large waders for food in the key wintering areas of Bangladesh, China, Vietnam, and Myanmar (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, Zöckler and Htin Hla 2009, Bird et al. 2010, Chowdhury 2010, C. Zöckler in litt. 2010, Zöckler et al. 2010b, Martinez and Lewthaithe 2013). Trapping using monofilament nets is also frequent on the Chinese coast during migration periods and Spoon-billed Sandpipers have been observed being caught (Peng et al. 2017).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I and II. The species has been added to the list as a Class 1 protected species on the National Key Protected Wild Animal List of China: it is forbidden to hunt, capture, kill, sell, acquire and use the species (Choi 2021). Fourteen sites along the coast of Bohai Gulf and the Yellow Sea in China have been nominated for World Heritage Site status. Protected areas in its breeding, staging and wintering areas include Moroshechnaya and several local wildlife refuges on the Chukotsk peninsula (Russia), Yancheng and Chongming Dongtan (China), Mai Po (Hong Kong), Lanyang estuary (Taiwan, China), Point Calimere and Chilka lake (India), and Xuan Thuy Nature Reserve (Vietnam). In September 2019 the Bird Conservation Society of Thailand completed the purchase of 8 hectares to conserve habitat at Pak Thale, within the Pak Thale-Laem Phak Bia Flyway Network site recognised by the Government of Thailand (Jearwattanakanok &amp; Yong 2019). The Gulf of Mottama (160,000 ha), Myanmar has also been proposed as a Ramsar site and the area belonging to Mon State is soon to be designated (Clark et al. 2014, Zöckler 2015). This work across the Gulf of Mottama headed by the Spoon-billed Sandpiper Task Force, with support from the Swiss Development Cooperation and the Rainforest Trust, also ensure sustainable development in line with conservation goals (C. Zöckler in litt. 2020). The species is also legally protected under the Wildlife Act of Myanmar, however the law lacks full implementation (Aung et al. 2020). In 2019, the main stop over sites in Tiaozini (Rudong) were also included into the World Heritage Site nomination (C. Zöckler in litt. 2020). Hunters within the area have also signed agreements to surrender trapping equipment and engage in alternate livelihoods (Ceci 2017). Work by the group 'SBS in China' recently lead to the local government designating a 10,000 ha area for Spoon-billed Sandpipers in Rudong (Clark et al. 2014). The Chinese government have additionally declared a moratorium for future coastal development (P. Insua-Cao in litt. 2019). Shellfish protected areas have also been designated, which will provide suitable feeding habitat for birds and protect local livelihoods. Annual surveys of breeding sites on Chukotka are undertaken and over 450 adults and young have been ringed on the breeding grounds since 2000 (Zöckler et al. 2008). Annual searches of potential new breeding sites have taken place from 2011 to at least 2013 (Zöckler 2013). Recent advances on the protection of important site for the species have additionally accelerated. In Myanmar, 2 further Ramsar sites protects the species in the the Ayeyarwady Delta (50,000 ha) and Nan Thar Island (40,000), with a vast increase in the official protection level, including preparations for the last remaining site in the south of the country to be protected (C. Zöckler in litt. 2020).  Since 2018, the government of Chukotka is also supporting the development of a 300,000 ha large protected area that is adequately named the Land of the Spoon-billed Sandpiper (Syroechkovsky 2019). A range of awareness and outreach programmes have taken place. Local support groups have been established in some breeding areas and negotiations have taken place to reduce short-term hunting pressure at one of the key wintering sites in Myanmar (Zöckler &amp; Htin Hla 2009, Zöckler et al. 2010b). Researchers and a local environmentalist group convinced two villages on Nan Thar Island, Myanmar, to agree to a hunting ban of the species, with a view to develop an ecologically and economically sound alternative in the future (C. Zöckler in litt. 2007, 2009, 2010, Zöckler et al. 2010b). The development of ecotourism at Nan Thar generated extra income for local people and encouraged them to protect the birds (Clark et al. 2014, Zöckler et al. 2014). In the Bay of Martaban, socio-economic surveys carried out in early 2010 indicated that bird-hunting is undesirable and that most hunters would readily switch to alternative livelihoods if assisted (BANCA 2010). These surveys were swiftly followed by mitigation activities in the same year, in which hunters agreed to stop their activities in exchange for equipment to provide them with an alternative income source, and awareness-raising events and materials were provided for whole communities (BANCA in litt. 2010). On the eastern shore of the Gulf of Martaban, 9 out of 15 hunters targeted by the mitigation activities had increased their livelihood status, the remaining six had neither increased nor decreased their livelihood status (BANCA 2012). Conservationists in Bangladesh successfully raised funds to provide hunters with loans so that they could establish new livelihoods, such as farming (Chowdhury et al. 2014). The Bangladesh Spoon-billed Sandpiper Conservation Project conducted a one year awareness-raising project on Sonadia Island, an important wintering site for the species (Clark et al. 2014). Activities involved former hunters visiting schools to talk about conservation work, film showings, boat races, mural painting and photography exhibitions (S. U. Chowdhury in litt. 2016). In 2011, awareness-raising and advocacy activities including two training workshops took place in schools in China. Schoolchildren living close to the species's breeding grounds in Russia have also been taught about the species and sent letters to other schoolchildren living along the flyway asking them to protect the species (Clark et al. 2014). A Species Action Plan was produced in 2006 (Zöckler et al. 2008), and updated in 2008 (Zöckler et al. 2008) and 2010 (Zöckler et al. 2010b). At the fifth meeting of the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership in Cambodia in December 2010, the partners agreed to establish a Task Force for this species, charged with implementing the action plan (Fowlie 2011). In 2012, the 'Saving Spoony's Chinese Wetlands' project came top in a vote organised by the Disney Foundation, winning $100,000 to support conservation efforts for the species (Clark et al. 2014). Headstarting, or artificial incubation and captive rearing on the breeding grounds, avoids the high levels of natural predation that occur at egg and chick stage. This significantly increased breeding success, with the number of wild birds fledged increasing by approximately five times per pair (D. Pain in litt. 2016). In addition, by taking eggs within days of them being laid early in the season, some birds lay a second clutch that they incubate and raise themselves. Headstarting expeditions in 2012 and 2013 have resulted in the release of a total of 25 juveniles from 35 eggs collected (Zöckler 2013). In 2015, 37 eggs were collected for headstarting in Chukotka, of which 35 were fertile (B. Hughes in litt. 2015). In July 2016, the headstarting programme successfully released 30 fledglings, the most birds released in a single year. 22 chicks from 30 eggs survived to fledging in 2020, but despite continued releases the number of headstarted birds appears to have ceased offsetting the decline at the release site in 2019 (Syroechkovskiy et al. 2020).A captive-rearing and breeding programme started in 2011, when eggs were collected in Chukotka, and the young birds reared in captivity in Russia were subsequently transported to purpose-built conservation breeding facilities at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust headquarters at Slimbridge, UK (Pain 2010). In 2012, eggs were transported from Chukotka direct to Slimbridge (Pain et al. 2011, Donald et al. 2013). In May 2014 the captive population numbered 25 birds (Clark et al. 2014). Two pairs of captive birds at Slimbridge started to breed in 2016 (D. Pain in litt. 2016). One chick fledged in 2018 but unfortunately died shortly after, but two chicks were successfully reared fledging in 2019 and remain alive in 2021. No further successful breeding has occurred, and in 2020 several of the eight and nine year-old founders of the captive population died, possibly due at least in part to age (Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust 2021).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to develop captive breeding programmes and continue to monitor numbers at known breeding sites and carry out searches of suitable habitat in north Kamchatka. Continue to survey wintering sites to monitor the population and identify key sites in the East Asian Flyway to help ensure their protection. Campaign against the continued reclamation of intertidal mudflats along the entire migration route. Restore reclaimed wetland sites. Continue to search for stopover sites in the Russian Far East (Clark et al. 2014). Actively prevent collection of eggs and birds for scientific purposes, museums and private collections. Take measures to ensure that researcher activity does not increase mortality. Ensure effective legal protection of all known breeding sites. Survey existing and potential wintering sites in Myanmar and Bangladesh. Stop hunting and trapping at key sites in Myanmar, Bangladesh and Russia. Ensure awareness-raising activities are maintained in the long-term. Ensure protection of newly discovered sites and existing sites, especially in South Korea. Legally protect it in all range states. Identify and mitigate pressures at breeding grounds. Lobby against plans for a deep-water port at Sonadia, Bangladesh (Bird et al. 2010, Chowdhury 2012) and protect important sites along the Meghna Estuary, Bangladesh (Chowdhury et al. 2018). Pursue protected area status for the Bay of Martaban and other coastal sites in Myanmar (BANCA in litt. 2010, Zöckler et al. 2014). Encourage initiatives that promote opportunities for ex-hunters to become bird guides (P. Palmer in litt. 2020). ",Indomalayan|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It nests in burrows in sand or guano, under clumps of vegetation or in recesses in scree (Brooke 2004). In Hawaii, first egg laying occurs in December with the last chicks fledging in June (McClelland et al. 2008). The species has been known to live for at least 14 years (Marks and Leasure 1992).","The most serious past and ongoing threat to this species is predation by invasive mammals. In Japan, rats and cats limit breeding to small predator-free islets in the Ogasawara Archipelago (McClelland et al. 2008). House rats Rattus rattus have been implicated in dramatic declines in Tristram’s Storm-petrel numbers on multiple islets by predation of eggs and adults, as well as local extirpation on some islands (Kawakami 2008). House rat eradication programs are currently in progress in multiple areas (McClellend et al. 2008, Yabe et al. 2009). Polynesian rats Rattus exulans caused the extirpation of the population on Kure Atoll (Rauzon et al. 1985), to which it is yet to return despite eradication being completed (McClelland et al. 2008). Invasive Pharaoh Ants on Laysan have been shown to be a source of chick mortality; however, it is thought the effect of this is relatively minor (McClelland &amp; Jones 2008). Due to breeding in burrows on sandy islands, Tristram’s Storm-petrel suffers significant annual nest loss as a result of weather and the fragility of sand burrows (McClelland et al. 2008). Sea level rise and additional wave action associated with climate change are likely to impact the breeding success of this species, though no prediction as to the severity of this threat has been made as of yet. Tristram’s Storm-petrel experiences significant breeding failure due to interspecific competition. Shearwaters were the largest cause of chick loss on both Laysan and Tern Islands due to their aggressive eviction of Storm-petrels (McClelland et al. 2008). On Laysan, the large Bonin Petrel colony was the greatest cause of hatching failure due to competition for burrows (Fefer et al. 1984). Albatrosses are known to alter, block up and cause the collapse of Storm-petrel burrows (McClelland et al. 2008), possibly aggravating this competition. Laysan and Nihoa Finches predate unattended and abandoned eggs on their respective islands, enhancing the risk associated with the stress-related abandonment behaviour shown by Tristram’s Storm-petrel (Marks and Leasure 1992, McClelland et al. 2008). It is unclear whether, in the absence of finch predation, these eggs would have been further brooded (McClelland et al. 2008) and as such, this may not represent a loss of hatching success.","Population estimates for breeding colonies suggest that the world population is no greater than c.10,000 pairs (i.e. c.20,000 mature individuals) and c.30,000 birds (Brooke 2004), while the population in Japan has been estimated at c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 individuals on migration in Japan (Brazil 2009).",Stable,"Hydrobates tristrami breeds in the Hawaiian archipelago (U.S.A.) on Nihoa (2,000-3,000 pairs), Necker, French Frigate Shoals (max 280 pairs), Laysan (500-2,500 pairs), Pearl and Hermes Reef (1,000-2,000 pairs), and may also breed on Midway, Lisianski and Kure (Rauzon et al. 1985, Harrison 1990, Baker et al. 1997, Enticott and Tipling 1997, McClelland et al. 2008). It also breeds on a few small predator-free islets of the Bonin and Izu Islands, Japan (McClelland et al. 2008), including six islands in the Bonin group, three of which were newly identified in 2005. The species is not recorded on the Volcano Islands, where it bred before the Second World War (Chiba et al. 2007). The global population is likely no greater than 30,000 birds, including 10,000 pairs (Brooke 2004). The species is difficult to monitor due to its high sensitivity to human disturbance during the incubation phase (Marks and Leasure 1992) and due to its habit of breeding in the winter months, when access to its remote breeding colonies is more difficult. Little is known about its post-breeding dispersal, but some move north to the seas east of Japan (Carboneras 1992, Enticott and Tipling 1997).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayLimited research has been carried out into the species's life history and ecology. Most of the known breeding population is protected by the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, which is devoid of human habitation, except when researchers are present (Marks and Leasure 1992). A recent research project has investigated the potential threat from introduced ants (E. van der Werf in litt. 2007).

It may have been driven extinct by diseases spread by introduced mosquitoes and habitat destruction. A set of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017) laid out methods for quantitatively estimating a species’s probability of extinction based on parameters associated with threats, in addition to records and surveys. Based on the application of these methods (Butchart et al. 2018), this species would qualify for reclassification as Critically Endangered. However, the authors recommended retaining it as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) because the final site for the species (the Olokui natural area reserve) is only 6.6 km2, less than half of which is suitable habitat, and it has been isolated for so long that it is highly unlikely that any population has persisted.","It is a shy and retiring bird of the montane forest canopy, although in the late 1800s it was reported as ubiquitous in forests from the lowlands to the higher elevations on Moloka'i and Lana'i (Scott et al. 1986, Wakelee and Fancy 1999). Like its congeners, it is primarily frugivorous (Wakelee and Fancy 1999, K. Wakelee in litt. 1999).","This species's drastic decline is probably attributable to the introduction of disease-carrying mosquitoes and habitat destruction. Mosquitoes were, until recently, restricted to the lowlands, but have followed the penetration of feral pigs into remote native rainforests over the last 25 years (Pratt 1994). The uplands of Moloka'i are probably too small to provide disease-free refugia. Apart from spreading the parasite Plasmodium relictum throughout the Olomao's range, pigs also modify native forests, as they carry alien weeds to new areas, whose rooting destroys the shrub layer (Pratt 1994). Habitat degradation through introduced Axis Deer Axis axis pose an additional threat (Loope and Medeiros 1995).","Any remaining population is assumed to be tiny (numbering fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals), with no confirmed records since 1980.",Unknown,"Myadestes lanaiensis is endemic to the central Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A., where it is (or was) known from Maui, Lana'i and Moloka'i. The nominate subspecies of Lana'i was last seen in 1933 and is now extinct. The race rutha of Moloka'i and Maui is also likely to be extinct (Clement and Hathway 2000). It had been extirpated from Maui before ornithologists arrived, but possibly survived until the mid-19th century (J. Lepson in litt. 1999). Most of the historical range on Moloka'i in Kamako'u-Pelekunu has been resurveyed and the species has probably been extirpated from that area (DOFAW and PIERC 1995, Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001); the last confirmed record from Moloka'i was in 1980 (Pyle and Pyle 2017). However, the species cannot yet be presumed to be Extinct, because the remote Oloku'i Plateau has not been resurveyed recently and could conceivably still harbour some birds. However, at the moment visits to this area are discouraged to prevent any introduction of invasive species. No more than half of the Natural Area Reserve represents suitable habitat (E. VanderWerf in litt. 2017). Any remaining population is likely to be tiny.","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe Kamakou Preserve and neighbouring land have been partially fenced and control programmes exist for feral ungulates (H. Baker and P. Baker in litt. 1999). The Oloku'i Natural Area, established in 1986, protects pristine native forest (Scott et al. 1986) where M. lanaiensis may persist (Wakelee and Fancy 1999).Conservation Actions ProposedConduct surveys to locate any remaining individuals and, if found, urgently assess actions required for the species's recovery. However, care should be taken and currently visits to the Oloku'i Plateau are discouraged to prevent any introduction of invasive species (E. VanderWerf in litt. 2017). Should it be rediscovered, consideration should be given to establishing a captive population at high elevation on East Maui, where the habitat is relatively intact and free of threat from mosquitoes and avian disease (USFWS 2003).",Oceanian,1980,true,false,Global

In Siberia it breeds in willow thickets in floodplains. In some regions the species has colonised drier habitats such as young woodland and farmland (maize, cereals and oil-seed rape fields) (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Copete and Christie 2016). Oil-seed rape fields have even become the most important breeding habitat for the species in lowland Britain (Gruar et al. 2006). The breeding season starts in early April and ends in August, depending on latitude and altitude. The species is mostly monogamous. The nest is built by the female, mostly on the ground, but sometimes in shrubs. The clutch, usually four or five eggs is incubated by both sexes. The chicks hatch after 12–15 days. They are fed by both parents and leave the nest after 9–12 days. The diet consists mainly of invertebrates during the breeding season and mainly seeds and other plant material at other times of the year. Birds in the south of the range are resident or make short distance movements whilst northern populations are almost entirely migratory (Copete and Christie 2016).","Agricultural intensification is considered the main cause of the decline of the species in Europe and especially the endangered subspecies E. s. witherbyi and E. s. lusitanica (Vera et al. 2014). In particular the availability of winter food in farmland has declined as a consequence of crop change and the use of herbicides, resulting in the disappearance of weed-rich stubbles, and the use of advanced technologies reducing the amount of spilled grain (Peach et al. 1999, Orlowski and Czarnecka 2007). In addition the destruction of wetlands and unfavourable management (e.g. intensive reed cutting) is another important threat to the species, including the endangered subspecies E. s. witherbyi and E. s. lusitanica (Vera et al. 2014).","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number 4,060,000-7,020,000 pairs, which equates to 8,130,000-14,000,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

Wintering habitat should be improved by preserving stubble fields. In addition the presence of heavily overgrown root crop and vegetable stubbles should be allowed to ensure the spontaneous regeneration of plant cover on fallows. These objectives should be promoted as part of agri-environmental schemes or within set-aside land options (Orłowski and Czarnecka 2007).Special attention should be paid to safeguard the small remaining populations of the endangered subspecies E. s. witherbyi and E. s. lusitanica by conducting annual censuses of the subspecies's population numbers, protecting all wetlands where it still occurs and conducting research on its taxonomy and ecology, in particular the species habitat requirements and pressures limiting the population. Other measures include compiling a national subspecies action plan; promoting extensive agricultural practices in areas surrounding the species's habitat in particular with regard to the use of insecticides; and maintaining fallow and stubble fields near its breeding areas as wintering feeding habitat (Atienza and Copete 2014).",Indomalayan|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The species breeds solitarily or in loose colonies of 2-50 or occasionally up to several hundred pairs (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It is typically a gregarious species, occurring in small groups (Snow and Perrins 1998) (up to 15 individuals) (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996) or larger flocks of several hundred up to a thousand individuals on migration, during the winter (Urban et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998) and at nightly roosts (Urban et al. 1986). Habitat Breeding The species typically breeds in shallow freshwater and brackish wetlands with sand, mud or clay substrates and open margins, islets or spits near water level (Snow and Perrins 1998). Suitable habitats include marshes and swamps, shallow lake edges, riverbeds, flooded fields (del Hoyo et al. 1996), irrigated areas (Snow and Perrins 1998), sewage ponds (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and fish-ponds (Snow and Perrins 1998).

Other populations are fully migratory (Kear 2005b) with females and juveniles leaving the breeding grounds in the western Palearctic from September and returning as early as February (Kear 2005b). The species breeds between March and June (Madge and Burn 1988) in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo et al. 1992) although the exact timing varies with latitude (Madge and Burn 1988). While the females are incubating (Johnsgard 1978) (from mid-May) (Flint et al. 1984, Scott and Rose 1996) the males gather (Madge and Burn 1988) in small flocks and migrate to moulting areas (Flint et al. 1984) where they undergo a flightless moulting period lasting for c.4 weeks (Scott and Rose 1996) (females moult near the breeding grounds) (Flint et al. 1984). Outside of the breeding season the species can be found in small to very large flocks (Madge and Burn 1988) numbering up to several hundreds or even thousands of individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998) especially when moulting (Scott and Rose 1996), on migration (Snow and Perrins 1998) and during the winter (Kear 2005b). The species may also roost both nocturnally and diurnally in communal groups when not breeding (Brown et al. 1982). Habitat The species occurs in almost every wetland type (del Hoyo et al. 1992) although it generally avoids fast-flowing, oligotrophic (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), deep, exposed, rough, rockbound waters and hard unvegetated areas such as rocky ground, sand dunes and artificial surfacing (Snow and Perrins 1998). It requires water less than 1 m deep for foraging (Snow and Perrins 1998) and shows a preference for freshwater habitats (Madge and Burn 1988) although it may frequent shallow brackish waters as long as they provide the cover (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996) of submerged, floating, emergent or riparian vegetation, dense reedbeds or overhanging branches (Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitats commonly frequented include flooded swampy woodlands, seasonal floodlands (Snow and Perrins 1998), wet grassy swamps and meadows, oxbow lakes (Flint et al. 1984), open waters with mudflats, banks or spits, irrigation networks, reservoirs, ornamental waters (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), canals and sewage farms (Snow and Perrins 1998). During the winter the species may also be found in saline habitats along the coast (Madge and Burn 1988) where water is shallow, fairly sheltered and within site of land (Snow and Perrins 1998) (e.g. brackish lagoons [Snow and Perrins 1998], brackish estuaries [del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998] and bays [del Hoyo et al. 1992]). Diet The species is omnivorous and opportunistic (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998), feeding by dabbling in water and by grazing on the land (Snow and Perrins 1998). Its diet consists of seeds and the vegetative parts of aquatic and terrestrial plants (e.g. crops) (del Hoyo et al. 1992), as well as terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates (especially in the spring and summer) such as insects, molluscs, crustaceans, worms and occasionally amphibians and fish (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression (Snow and Perrins 1998) or bowl of vegetation that can be situated in many different locations such as within vegetation on the ground, in natural tree cavities (del Hoyo et al. 1992) up to 10 m high (Africa) (Brown et al. 1982), under fallen dead wood, on tree stumps (Flint et al. 1984), under bushes (Brown et al. 1982) and even in abandoned nests of other species (e.g. herons or crows) (Flint et al. 1984). Nests are generally placed close to water (Kear 2005b) although occasionally they may be some distance away (Madge and Burn 1988). Management information ""Extensive"" grazing of wetland grasslands (c.0.5 cows per hectare) was found to attract a higher abundance of the species in Hungary (Baldi et al. 2005). Studies in Danish coastal wetlands found that the spatial restriction of shore-based shooting was more successful at maintaining waterfowl population sizes than was the temporal restriction of shooting, and therefore that wildfowl reserves should incorporate shooting-free refuges that include adjacent marshland in order to ensure high waterfowl species diversity (Bregnballe et al. 2004). The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the UK resulted in an increase in invertebrate food availability and an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes, which in turn led to an increased use of the habitat for brood rearing by the species (Giles 1994). The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994). The species will also nest in artificial nest boxes (Brown et al. 1982, del Hoyo et al. 1992).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss from pollution (e.g. petroleum [Grishanov 2006] and pesticide pollution [Kwon et al. 2004]), wetland drainage, peat-extraction, changing wetland management practices (e.g. decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) and the burning and mowing of reedbeds (Grishanov 2006). The species also suffers mortality as a result of lead shot ingestion (e.g. in Spain [Mateo et al. 1999] and France [Mondain-Monval et al. 2002]) and poisoning from white phosphorous ingestion (from firearms) in Alaska (Steele 1997). It is also susceptible to duck virus enteritis (DVE) (Friend 2006), avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and avian botulism (Rocke 2006) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases (although it may be able to withstand sporadic losses due to its high reproductive potential) (Rocke 2006). The species is predated by American mink Neovison vison in Europe (Opermanis et al. 2001). Utilisation The species is hunted throughout the world (Kear 2005b) mainly for sport (Evans and Day 2002, Bregnballe et al. 2006, Mondain-Monval et al. 2006, Sorrenti et al. 2006), but also for commercial use (food) (Balmaki and Barati 2006). The eggs of this species were (and possibly still are) harvested in Iceland (Gudmundsson 1979).","The global population is estimated to number &gt; c.19,000,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 2,850,000-4,610,000 pairs, which equates to 5,700,000-9,220,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Increasing,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour All populations of this species undergo post-breeding dispersive movements (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Populations breeding in the tropics are sedentary (del Hoyo et al. 1992) or partially migratory (in relation to rainfall) (Brown et al. 1982), whereas Palearctic and Nearctic populations are migratory (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1992). The timing of the breeding season varies geographically (del Hoyo et al. 1992) although temperate breeders tend to nest in the spring and summer (e.g. April to July) and tropical breeders nest in the part of the rain cycle when food becomes maximally available (this may be during the rains or in the dry season) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species typically breeds in colonies of tens, hundreds or even a thousand pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), sometimes with other species (e.g. 450 pairs in a mixed colony of over 3,000 nests in Australia) (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Some populations also show a tendency to breed solitarily or in small groups (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Outside of the breeding season the species may feed solitarily (del Hoyo et al. 1992) or in small loose groups (Marchant and Higgins 1990) (e.g. of 12-50 individuals) (Brown et al. 1982), although flocks of hundreds or more individuals may form where food is abundant (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species is a diurnal feeder (del Hoyo et al. 1992) but is most active at dawn and dusk (although in coastal environments it feeding habits are determined by tidal stages) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and roosts at night in trees (Brown et al. 1982) alongside lakes or rivers or in mangroves, often with other species (Langrand 1990). Habitat The species inhabits all kinds of inland and coastal wetlands (del Hoyo et al. 1992) although it is mainly found along the coast in the winter (e.g. in the Palearctic Region) (Snow and Perrins 1998) or during droughts (e.g. in Australia) (Marchant and Higgins 1990). It frequents river margins, lakes shores, marshes, flood-plains (del Hoyo et al. 1992), oxbows, streams (Snow and Perrins 1998), damp meadows (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), rice-fields, drainage ditches (del Hoyo et al. 1992), aquaculture ponds, reservoirs (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and sewage works (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Hockey et al. 2005) inland, and the shallows of salt-lakes (Marchant and Higgins 1990), saltpans, mudflats, coastal swamps, mangroves (del Hoyo et al. 1992), saltmarshes, seagrass flats, offshore coral reefs, lagoons (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and estuaries when in coastal locations (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Diet In aquatic habitats its diet consists of fish, amphibians, snakes, aquatic insects and crustaceans although in drier habitats terrestrial insects, lizards, small birds and mammals are more commonly taken (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is constructed from sticks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and vegetation (Brown et al. 1982) and is normally positioned over water at a height of 1-15 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) in reedbeds, bamboos (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes, trees (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (e.g. willow Salix spp.), mangroves (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and other plants near water or on islands in sites that are protected from ground predators (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups where nests may be less than 1 m apart or touching, although they are usually placed more spread out in reedbeds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Breeding pairs may also reuse nests from previous years (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Management information Breeding site conservation should include colony protection, control of disturbance and vegetation management, and the conservation of feeding areas should include the management of hydrology, salt intrusion, contaminants and disturbance (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). An artificial island nesting site created in the Camargue, France succeeded in attracting nesting pairs to the area (Hafner 2000).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1992) for example through drainage, grazing, clearing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants (Marchant and Higgins 1990). Breeding colonies in Madagascar may be declining due to egg and chick gathering from colonies by local people (Langrand 1990, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and the species previously suffered from intense persecution for the plume trade (this is no longer a threat) (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","Estimate includes totals for 'Ardea modesta'. The European population of A. alba is estimated at 20,700-34,900 pairs, which equates to 41,500-69,900 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA).Conservation Actions ProposedThe following information refers to the species's European range only: Breeding site conservation should include colony protection, control of disturbance and vegetation management, and the conservation of feeding areas should include the management of hydrology, salt intrusion, contaminants and disturbance (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).

Based on this evidence, it is suspected that the population has declined by at least 20-29% over three generations. Thus the species is classified as Near Threatened.","The Flesh-footed Shearwater mainly occurs in the subtropics over continental shelves and slopes, and occasionally in inshore waters. Individuals also pass through the tropics and over deeper waters when on migration to the North Pacific and Indian Oceans (Brooke 2004). Individuals have been recorded over waters of 13–23°C in the south-western Pacific Ocean (Reid 2002) and over waters of 11–16°C in the northern Pacific Ocean (Reid 2010, Reid et al. 2013). Pairs breed on islands in burrows on sloping ground in coastal forest, scrubland, or grassland (Powell et al. 2007). Nests consist of enlarged chambers at the end of burrows (1-3 metres in length), with the entrance often covered by plant material (Waugh et al. 2014).","Records of bycatch in the Australian Eastern Tuna and Billfish Fishery (ETBF) have been very high; 0.38 birds caught per 1,000 hooks and an estimated 8,972 - 18,490 individuals killed in the period 1998-2002 (Baker and Wise 2005), sufficient to be driving significant declines. Considerable levels of bycatch from gill-nets, purse-seines, longlines and inshore trawl have been recorded across the species’s range (Japan, Australia, Russia and New Zealand) affecting the great majority of the population. Some mitigation methods have been put in place to reduce incidental capture, however the species is repeatedly found to be amongst the seabirds at greatest risk. In Baker and Wise’s (2005) findings, 91% of all birds taken were Flesh-footed Shearwaters. From 1992 to 1996, estimates of seabird bycatch rates on Japanese long-line vessels fishing within the southern Australian EEZ varied between 0.1 and 0.3 birds per 1,000 hooks, with Flesh-footed Shearwaters accounting for around 10% of the observed bycatch (Tuck et al. 2003). An additional 677 Flesh-footed Shearwaters are reportedly taken each year in the Japanese neon flying squid driftnet fishery (Ogi 2008) and 116 in the land-based salmon gillnet fishery (DeGange and Day 1991). In New Zealand, the species is frequently captured in commercial fisheries, ranked as the 3rd (out of 70) most at risk in 2013 (based on estimated annual potential fatalities vs. potential biological removal) (Richard and Abraham 2013), and 5th in 2014 (Richard and Abraham 2014). Mortality in the ETBF has evidently declined in recent years, but this is thought to be largely due to the fishery shifting north in 2006/07 due to a change in the targeted fish species (Reid et al. 2013b). Consequently, high mortality rates in the ETBF may occur again in future years if the fishery returns south. Recreational fisheries bycatch is also likely to be significant (Tennyson et al. 2012). Data on Flesh-footed Shearwater bycatch in the West and South Coast Purse Seine Managed Fisheries in Western Australia (six vessels operated in 2010) suggest up to six adult birds are killed per day per boat (DEF 2005) with more than 512 birds entangled in one season (Dunlop 2007). Rapid increases in the incidence of plastic ingestion by chicks over the past decade is suspected to be one of the drivers of decline at Lord Howe Island (90% of tested fledglings contained considerable quantities of plastic [Lavers and Bond 2016]) and in other colonies. Preliminary data from New Zealand indicates around 44% of adult birds contain plastic (Robertson et al. 2004). Individuals of all ages have been found to suffer lethal effects. A linear relationship between burrow density and plastic fragments suggests this species is particularly vulnerable to plastic pollution (Buxton et al. 2013). High levels of heavy metal contamination (silver, aluminium, copper, mercury, arsenic and cadmium) have been detected in multiple populations and may be co-pollutants linked to plastic consumption (Bond and Lavers 2011, Lavers et al. 2014, Lewis 2016). The habit of nesting and roosting in burrows on the ground also exposes the Flesh-footed Shearwater to interaction with terrestrial predators and other competitors. In the late 1930s, predation by Red Fox Vulpes vulpes was deemed responsible for completely eradicating a breeding population from mainland Western Australia (Warham 1958). Introduced House Rats Rattus rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus are present in parts of the breeding range and have minor effects on egg and chick mortality, representing an added stress factor on reproductive success (Taylor 2000, Gaze 2000, Pridell et al. 2006). On Breaksea Island, shearwaters compete with rabbits for burrows (Lavers 2015). Several roads pass through or run adjacent to breeding colonies on Lord Howe Island, and mortalities are frequently reported along the roadsides (Hutton 2003, DECC 2008). The density of carcasses adjacent to roads was 25 times greater than elsewhere in the colony, and an estimated 125 birds were killed on roads during the 2008/2009 breeding season (Reid 2010, Reid et al. 2013a). These rates are sufficient to drive slow population declines (Reid et al. 2013). The number of cars and tourists are increasing on the Island each year, suggesting this is a growing threat to affected populations. Extensive areas of Flesh-footed Shearwater habitat have been cleared for residential developments up to the recent past. As a result, the extent of suitable habitat on Lord Howe Island was considerably reduced (down 35% from 37.8 ha in 1978 to 24.3 ha in 2002 [Priddel et al. 2006]), but recent restrictions have been reported to have halted further conversion, despite an apparent continued decline in burrow density (Reid et al. 2013).","Brooke (2004) estimated the global population to number &gt;650,000 individuals, but this has recently been revised downward following the identification of a number of significant errors in the historical literature, as well as recent population surveys. Overall, the current global population is substantially smaller than previously thought, comprising only around 74,000 breeding pairs (Lavers 2015). In Australia, the population on Lord Howe Island had been estimated at c.20,000-40,000 breeding pairs in 1978 (Fullagar and Disney 1981) and 17,462 breeding pairs in 2003 (Priddel et al. 2003). In 2009, the population was estimated at 16,267 pairs (95%-confidence interval 11,649–21,250), representing a decline in the number of pairs of 6.8% since 2003, equalling a decline of approximately 1.3% per annum (Reid et al. 2013). In New Zealand, Robertson and Bell (1984) estimated the breeding population at 50,000-100,000 pairs in 1983, while Taylor (2000) considered the population to be at 25,000-50,000 pairs. Recent surveys suggest the population is closer to 10,000-15,000 pairs (Baker et al. 2010, Waugh et al. 2013). The Western Australian population was recently uplisted from Least Concern to Vulnerable (DPaW 2015). Following revision of the breeding population size, the species was recently up-listed to Near Threatened in Australia (Garnett et al. 2011) and to Nationally Vulnerable in New Zealand (Robertson et al. 2013).",Decreasing,"This species breeds on St Paul Island (French Southern Territories), Lord Howe Island (Australia), islands off south-west mainland Australia, south Australia (at two isolated colonies), and islands off North and South Islands (New Zealand). In the non-breeding season, it ranges north through the western Pacific Ocean to the seas off Japan, Russia and Korea, with small numbers reaching North America, and north through the Indian Ocean and west to the southern tip of Africa (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Rayner et al. 2011, Reid et al. 2013, Bond and Lavers 2015). ","",Terrestrial|Marine,Conservation Actions UnderwayLord Howe Island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour The species is sedentary on Atlantic islands (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996) and in some areas in south-western maritime countries (Snow and Perrins 1998) but is otherwise strongly migratory (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). The spring migration starts at the end of February (Ferrand et al. in prep) (the timing of this movement being closely related to temperature), with the species arriving on the breeding grounds between March and mid-May. In Europe, the species breeds from the end of February to July (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The autumn migration to the wintering grounds is largely governed by the timing of the first winter frosts (e.g. from October to November) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species is typically solitary and usually migrates singly or in groups of 5-6 (Snow and Perrins 1998). Individuals may also become aggregated by topography or weather conditions, especially when migrating overland or where food and shelter are restricted (Snow and Perrins 1998). It typically forages nocturnally during the winter (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat The distribution of earthworms is an important habitat characteristic for the species throughout the year (Johnsgard 1981). Breeding For breeding the species requires extensive unfragmented areas (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996) of broadleaved deciduous or mixed broadleaved/coniferous forest (Johnsgard 1981) containing a dense undergrowth of shrubs and ground cover (Lutz and Pagh Jensen in prep) (e.g. of brambles Rubus spp., holly Ilex aquifolium, hazel Corylus avellana, gorse Ulex spp., bracken Pteridium spp. or bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Lutz and Pagh Jensen in prep) and with a mosaic (del Hoyo et al. 1996) of dry, warm resting places, moist areas for foraging (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986) (e.g. streams, springs or damp, swampy patches) (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and clearings or other open areas as flight paths (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986). The species may also nest in swampy forests with mossy ground, brooks and other watercourses or alternatively in coniferous forest with moist leaf litter and an undergrowth of broadleaved shrubs and ferns (Johnsgard 1981). Non-breeding The species's habitats requirements during the daylight hours of the non-breeding season are similar to its breeding habitat requirements but are less restricted (del Hoyo et al. 1996). As well as extensive broadleaved or mixed broadleaved/coniferous forest (Johnsgard 1981) the species will also occupy young conifer plantations (del Hoyo et al. 1996), hedges with high densities of trees and shrubs (Duriez et al. 2005b), smaller woods, areas of scrub (Hayman et al. 1986) and coppiced habitats with coppice of between 7 and 20 years old (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It still shows a strong preference for woodlands with rich (e.g. mull) humus types that have high earthworm biomasses, and a dense shrub strata however (Duriez et al. 2005b). At night during this season the species gathers to roost and feed in damp, earthworm-rich, permanent grasslands (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Duriez et al. 2005b) sometimes 3-4 km away from woodland areas used for cover during the day (Hayman et al. 1986), showing a preference for grazed meadows compared to cultivated fields (as the latter contain higher earthworm biomasses) (Duriez et al. 2005b). The species may also feed on intertidal mud during freezing weather (Hayman et al. 1986). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of earthworms, especially during the non-breeding season (del Hoyo et al. 1996), but the species may also take adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, earwigs and millipedes), spiders, slugs, leaches, ribbon worms (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and plant material such as seeds, fruit, agricultural grain (e.g. oats and maize), and grass roots and leaves (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Small freshwater bivalve molluscs and crustaceans are also taken by migrating birds (Johnsgard 1981). The composition of the diet may differ between the sexes (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression in the ground concealed by shrubs (del Hoyo et al. 1996) in open wooded sites (Johnsgard 1981), often at the base of a tree or near a dead fallen branch or log (Johnsgard 1981). Management information In France, both wintering and breeding populations have been monitored since the beginning of the 1990s (Ferrand et al. 2006); in autumn-winter, the monitoring is based on indexes of abundance from data collected by hunters (approx. 1,000) and ringers (approx. 400); in spring, the monitoring is based on censuses of roding males in May-June carried out by a network of 400 observers; wintering population seems to be slightly increasing (1992-2007). Annual success of reproduction is estimated from analysis of wings collected by hunters (mainly in France (Ferrand et al. 2006) and Denmark (Clausager 2006)) and from ringing data (5,000 individuals every year in France). Hunting bags are regularly estimated in some Europeans countries, especially in Denmark (Clausager 2006), in the European part of Russia (Blokhin et al. 2006), in Finland, in Sweden (Ferrand and Gossmann 2001) and in Switzerland. The annual European hunting bag is estimated at 3-4 million birds (Ferrand and Gossmann 2001). Bag limits are applied in different European countries, especially in France, Italy and Portugal (Ferrand and Gossmann 2001). In Britain an appropriate method of surveying the species was found using data on seasonal and evening patterns of summer male display (Hoodless et al. 2006). It was found that in Britain the best months for surveying the species are May and June, and that the detection of 83% of male passes at a fixed point should be possible in a survey lasting 1 hour and commencing 15 minutes before sunset (Hoodless et al. 2006). There is evidence from France that hunting reserves may be efficient tools for conserving wintering woodcocks, but only if buffer zones at least 1 km wide where hunting pressures are kept low and under-control are in place around reserves (Duriez et al. 2005a). In France it was also found that forestry management practices should preserve rich humus types and coppices by choosing tree species that ameliorate the soil and by soil tilling (Duriez et al. 2005b). The species may also benefit from set-aside land, grass field-borders and the simplification of farm practices (e.g. by reducing soil tilling and direct sowing) (Duriez et al. 2005b).","Breeding The most significant threat to the species in its breeding range is the increased fragmentation of woodlands (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species is threatened by the disappearance of permanent grasslands (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and through the intensification of agricultural practices (e.g. the destruction of hedges, decreases in the number of permanent grazed meadows and the impoverishment of soil fauna as a result of ploughing and chemical application) (Duriez et al. 2005b). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza (both in its breeding and wintering range) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). The species is widely hunted, with the largest numbers taken in France, Italy, UK and Spain.","The global population is estimated to number c.10,000,000-26,000,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This is a strongly migratory coastal seabird, which usually fishes in very shallow water only a few centimetres deep, often over the advancing tideline or in brackish lagoons and saltmarsh creeks (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It has the most inshore distribution of all terns. It breeds between May and July in solitary pairs or small monospecific groups usually of 1-15 pairs (rarely over 40 pairs) ,occasionally amidst colonies of other terns (Flint et al. 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding may be timed to coincide with peak fish abundance (Perrow et al. 2006). Northern breeders depart the breeding grounds from late-July onwards (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996), travelling first to moulting sites where they form large roosts before continuing southwards (Tavecchia et al. 2006). The species is gregarious throughout the year and usually feeds singly, in small groups or larger scattered flocks, congregating in many thousands on passage in small wetlands where fish fry are abundant (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on barren or sparsely vegetated beaches, islands and spits of sand, shingle, shell fragments, pebbles, rocks or coral fragments on seashores or in estuaries, saltmarshes, saltpans, offshore coral reefs, rivers, lakes and reservoirs (Flint et al. 1984, de Silva 1991, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It may also nest on dry mudflats in grassy areas, but shows a preference for islets surrounded by saline or fresh water, where small fish can be caught without the need for extensive foraging flights (de Silva 1991, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season, the species frequents tidal creeks, coastal lagoons and saltpans and may foraging at sea up to 15 km offshore (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of small fish (e.g. Ammodytes spp., roach Rutilus rutilus, rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus, carp Cyprinus carpio and perch Perca fluviatilis) and crustaceans 3-6 cm long as well as insects, annelid worms and molluscs (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In Scotland, Little Terns feed mainly on small fish and invertebrates, including herring, sandeel, and shrimps (Crangon vulgaris) (BirdLife International 2000). In Portugal, birds were found to feed mainly on sand-smelts (Atherina spp.) and gobies (Pomatoschistus spp.), which were the most abundant fish species in the study areas (Catry et al. 2006). On Rigby Island, Australia, chicks were fed entirely on juvenile fish of the families Clupeidae, Engraulidae, Pomatomidae and Carangidae, including pilchard, southern anchovy and blue sprat (Taylor and Roe 2004). Breeding site The nest is a bare scrape positioned on the ground in less than 15 % vegetation cover on beaches of sand, pebbles, shingle, shell fragments, coral fragments or rock above the high tide-line and often only a few metres away from shallow clear water (Flint et al. 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Alternatively, in more marshy habitats (e.g. coastal saltmarshes), the species may build a nest of shells or vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species nests in small loose colonies, with neighbouring nests usually placed more than 2 m apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Foraging range In Spain, 95% of foraging terns were observed less than 4 km away from the nearest colony (Bertolero et al. 2005). However, the foraging range of individuals varies according to whether they are currently breeding. In Norfolk, UK, birds with an active nest occupied a range of &lt;6.3 km2 with a range span of up to 4.6 km, whereas failed birds ranged widely, travelling up to 27 km in a single foraging bout (Perrow et al. 2006). In Portugal, ranges were found to be significantly greater during incubation (April-May) than during chick rearing (June-July) (Paiva et al. 2007). Little Terns prefer channels and lagoons for foraging, rather than deeper marine habitats (Bertolero et al. 2005, Paiva et al. 2007). They also prefer areas with abundant resources, entrance channels and main lagoon channels with strong currents, and areas with alternative feeding resources nearby (Paiva et al. 2007). Areas subjected to strong human pressure and salt marshes are avoided (Bertolero et al. 2005, Paiva et al. 2007). The species tends to forage preferentially at low tide (Paiva et al. 2007).","Habitat loss and degradation through the development of foreshore poses a significant threat to the Little Tern, with relative sea level rises predicted due to climate change also threatening beach nesting habitats. The Red Fox Vulpes vulpes was noted as the main cause of breeding failure in New South Wales (Australia) in 1995/96 (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2003), and a constant threat at various protected colonies in the UK, such as those in North Wales, where Common Kestrel Falco tinnunculus predation was also considered a factor (Gronant Little Tern Report 2015). The population of Red Fox in the UK has increased in size and range due to changing game-keeping practices, meaning they are likely an increased threat (Tapper 1992). In some parts of the range, birds are also vulnerable to nest predation by the Silver Gull Larus novaehollandiae. The Silver Gull population in New South Wales (Australia) has risen from a few pairs to over 50,000 (NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service 2003). Gulls are also likely to be problematic in other areas, with the culling of predatory gulls in Carleton, Quebec (Canada), key to fledging success (Magella and Brousseau 2001). Little Terns are vulnerable to disturbance from birdwatchers, photographers and the general public, leading to nest failures (Gronant Little Tern Report 2015, BBC 2017). In the UK, 69% of the population breeds on mainland beaches in East Anglia and seems to negatively select for beaches with high disturbance level (Ratcliffe et al. 2008). Expensive interventions and volunteer effort is required to limit anthropogenic disturbance (Ratcliffe et al. 2008, Gronant Little Tern Report 2015). Egg collection is an ongoing threat, and has been recorded on multiple occasions at Crimdon (BBC 2017), one of the few colonies in the UK.","The global population is estimated to number c.190,000-410,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 36,000-53,000 pairs, which equates to 71,900-106,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). National population estimates include: c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in China; c.100-10,000 breeding pairs, c.50-1,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in Taiwan; c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 individuals on migration in Korea and c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 individuals on migration in Japan (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"This species is breeding through much of Europe, scattered along the coast and inland in parts of Africa, in much of western, central and the extreme east and south of Asia, and in northern parts of Australasia. Migratory individuals expand the range to include most of the coast of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, the western coast of India and most of the waters of south-east Asia and Australasia, including New Zealand. One seasonally breeding colony is also present on Hawaii (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species and is covered under the African Eurasian Waterbird Agreement. It is on Annex II of the Bern Convention. Within the EU, it is listed on Annex I of the Birds Directive. Protective measures, such as fencing-off sensitive nesting areas, erecting warning signs and wardening, are effective measures of increasing the breeding success of this species on sandy beaches (Richards 1990, Medeiros et al. 2007). There is also evidence that earlier breeders benefit more (i.e. have higher reproductive success) from protective measures, suggesting that conservation efforts can be maximised if concentrated earlier in the season (Medeiros et al. 2007). Breeding pairs are also known to be attracted to coastal locations where artificial nesting sites have been constructed (e.g. beaches of bare shingle and islands or rafts covered with sparse vegetation) (Burgess and Hirons 1992). A conservation scheme for the protection of breeding colonies of gulls and terns in coastal lagoons and deltas (e.g. Po Delta, Italy) involves protection from human disturbance, prevention of erosion of islet complexes, habitat maintenance and the creation of new islets for nest sites (Fasola and Canova 1996). The scheme particularly specifies that small bare islets of 0.1-0.8 ha with reduced vegetation cover (less than 30 %) and sward heights less than 20 cm should be maintained or created as additional nesting sites for this species (Fasola and Canova 1996).

Other populations (e.g. in north-east Asia and North America) are fully migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds throughout the year in the tropics with different regional peaks (del Hoyo et al. 1992) depending on food availability (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It breeds colonially, often with other species, in groups that number from a few dozen to several thousand pairs, even up to 10,000 pairs in Africa (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The nesting effort of the species is related to rainfall patterns, leading to an annual variation in productivity (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Outside of the breeding season the species remains gregarious (Brown et al. 1982, del Hoyo et al. 1992), feeding in loose flocks of 10-20 individuals (Brown et al. 1982) and often gathering in flocks of hundreds or even thousands of individuals where food is abundant (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Nocturnal roosting sites in Africa commonly hold a few hundred to 2,000 individuals (Brown et al. 1982). The species is a diurnal feeder (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and commonly associates with native grazing mammals or domesticated livestock (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and may follow farm machinery to capture disturbed prey (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Habitat The species inhabits open grassy areas such as meadows (del Hoyo et al. 1992), livestock pastures (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), semi-arid steppe (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and open savanna grassland subject to seasonal inundation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), dry arable fields (del Hoyo et al. 1992), artificial grassland sites (e.g. lawns, parks, road margins and sports fields) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), flood-plains (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), freshwater swamps, rice-fields, wet pastures (del Hoyo et al. 1992), shallow marshes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), mangroves (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and irrigated grasslands (with ponds, small impoundments, wells, canals, small rivers and streams) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It rarely occupies marine habitats or forested areas (del Hoyo et al. 1992) although in Australia it may enter woodlands and forests, and it shows a preference for freshwater (Marchant and Higgins 1990) although it may also use brackish or saline habitats (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occurs from sea-level up to c.1,500 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or locally up to c.4,000 m (Peru) (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Diet Its diet consists primarily of insects such as locusts, grasshoppers (del Hoyo et al. 1992), beetles, adult and larval Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, dragonflies (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and centipedes but worms (Brown et al. 1982), spiders (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), crustaceans, frogs, tadpoles, molluscs, fish, lizards, small birds, rodents and vegetable matter (e.g. palm-nut pulp) may also be taken (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is constructed of twigs and vegetation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and is positioned up to 20 m high in reedbeds (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), marshes, mangroves, dense thickets (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes or trees (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), usually over or surrounded by water (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups with the nests placed close or touching (Snow and Perrins 1998). Management information The species can adversely affect the trees and bushes it uses for nesting, which may lead to the abandonment of the colony site if it is not managed (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","Large colonies nesting in urban areas are perceived as a public nuisance and may be persecuted (e.g. by disturbance to prevent colony establishment, removal or direct killing) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). In its breeding range the species is threatened by wetland degradation and destruction such as lake drainage for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Armenia) (Balian et al. 2002), and in some parts of its range it is susceptible to pesticide poisoning (organophosphates and carbamates) (Kwon et al. 2004).

It occurs on plateaus or gentle slopes with montane tundra in the subarctic at heights of 300-1,600 m (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In its wintering range the species occurs in sheltered coastal habitats such as inlets, bays, harbours, estuaries and lagoons with large intertidal mud and sandflats, oceanic sandy beaches with nearby mudflats (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996), sandy spits and islets, muddy shorelines with mangroves and occasionally exposed reefs or rock platforms (Higgins and Davies 1996). It roosts in refuges (Rogers et al. 2006) such as shallow water in sheltered sites, on coastal dunes or on saltflats amongst mangroves (Higgins and Davies 1996) during high tides (Rogers et al. 2006).On passage the species stages in estuaries and on intertidal mudflats (Tomkovich 1997, Moores 2006). The adult breeding diet consists predominantly of plant material such as berries (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (e.g. of Empetrum nigrum) (Johnsgard 1981) and pine kernels of dwarf pine Pinus pumilla (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Small chicks feed exclusively on insects (e.g. larval Diptera and Coleoptera) and spiders (del Hoyo et al. 1996). During the winter and on passage the species takes bivalves up to 36 mm long from intertidal mudflats as well as gastropods, crustaceans (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (e.g. crabs and shrimps) (Higgins and Davies 1996), annelid worms and echinoderms (e.g. sea cucumbers) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The nest may be an open depression in moss (Flint et al. 1984) but very few nests have been found (Johnsgard 1981). This species is a long-distance migrant that largely travels along the coast making few stopovers (del Hoyo et al. 1996) but utilising different routes in the autumn and the spring (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). It breeds from late-May to late-June, departing the breeding grounds in July and arriving on the wintering grounds between August and October (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The return migration to the breeding grounds takes place from March to April (del Hoyo et al.1996) although juvenile non-breeders often remain in the tropical parts of the wintering range for the breeding season (Hayman et al. 1986). The species forages in large flocks of one hundred to several thousand (del Hoyo et al.1996) at favoured sites on passage (Hayman et al. 1986), but during the winter it typically forages in small groups (Johnsgard 1981).","Loss of intertidal stopover habitats in the Yellow Sea region is thought to be a key driver in population declines of shorebirds (Amano et al. 2010, Yang et al. 2011). Up to 65% of intertidal habitat in the Yellow Sea has been lost over the past 50 years with habitat loss estimated at a rate of &gt;1% annually (Murray et al. 2014). Losses are attributed to reclamation for agriculture, aquaculture, and other development and are expected to continue or accelerate owing to population growth around the Yellow Sea. Degradation and loss of wetland habitats in the Yellow Sea region are also attributed to environmental pollution (Kelin and Qiang 2006) (e.g. oil contamination of intertidal mudflats) (Tomkovich 1997), reduced river flows and human disturbance (Kelin and Qiang 2006) (e.g. from off-road vehicles, tourists and hunters) (Tomkovich 1997).In South Korea, after the loss of the important Saemangeum stopover area and almost all of the tidal-flats in Asan Bay and much of Namyang bay, possibly only five sites nationwide remain internationally important. Of these, only one (the Geum Estuary) currently has a low risk of reclamation, with the other four at risk due to the construction of tidal power plants and barrages, industrial use and urban expansion (N. Moores in litt. 2009). Benthic food stocks used by the species reportedly crashed at Yalujiang NNR, Liaoning in 2014 and 2015 (D. Melville in litt. 2015). In 2015, most birds departed Yalujiang and moved to northern Bohai, however, it seems unlikely that this site will exist in five years time, owing to extensive reclamation works (D. Melville in litt. 2015). In the Philippines, India and Australia other threats may include mangrove afforestation, habitat degradation caused by intense fishing activities and harvesting of molluscs and bivalves, infrastructure projects, aquaculture, oil spills and invasive alien plant species (Leyrer et al. 2014). The species is also potentially threatened by climate change because it has a geographically bounded distribution: its global distribution is restricted to within c. 10o latitude from the polar edge of continent and within which 20-50% of current vegetation type is projected to disappear under doubling of CO2 levels (BirdLife International unpublished data).","The global population was estimated to number c. 380,000 individuals in 2006 (Wetlands International 2006). However following the reclamation of the tidal flats at Saemanguem (South Korea), c. 90,000 non-breeding individuals disappeared from the area. Surveys elsewhere in South Korea confirmed they had not been displaced, and a decline of the same magnitude and timing in Australia suggests that individuals previously using Saemanguem have died (D. Rogers in litt. 2009). Therefore a new global population was estimated at 292,000-295,000 individuals in 2007 (Wetlands International 2015).",Decreasing,"This species breeds in north-east Siberia, Russia, wintering mainly in Australia, but also throughout the coastline of South-East Asia and on the coasts of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The Yellow Sea of North Korea, South Korea and China is a particularly important stop-over site on migration in both spring and autumn. The Yalu Jiang coastal wetland in the north Yellow Sea has been identified as a key site for the species during northward migration (Choi et al. 2014). It is thought that the southern Yellow Sea is used as a temporary stopover area whilst the northern Yellow Sea acts as a key staging site where birds refuel (Ma et al. 2013). The global population has been estimated at 380,000 individuals, of which 176,000 were thought to pass through South Korea (Wetlands International 2006). Since then the reclamation and development of wetlands in South Korea has led to a decline in the observed counts of non-breeding populations, mostly notably including dramatic declines at the Saemangeum wetland which previously held c.20-30% of the global population on migration (Moores in litt. 2009, Rogers et al. in litt. 2009). The population estimate has therefore been updated accordingly with the most recent population size thought to be 292,000-295,000 individuals in 2007 (Wetlands International 2015).Despite there being no observed declines within the Chinese portion of the Yellow Sea, further declines at smaller staging grounds in Japan and at major wintering grounds in Australia (of c.90,000 individuals [Rogers et al. 2009]) make it clear that the population is declining overall (Amano 2006, Moores et al. 2008, R. Clemens in litt. 2010). These are supported by recent data from Australasia suggesting that the population has decreased by 77.8% over three generations (22 years) (Studds et al. in prep.).","",Terrestrial|Marine,Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayIt is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) (CMS 2015).

The European and North African populations migrate across the Sahara Desert between late-July and early-September (leaving breeding grounds June to mid-July) to reach wintering grounds in tropical Africa from late-August onwards (del Hoyo et al. 1996). These population return to their breeding grounds from mid-March, where they breed April-June (Europe) or March-May (North Africa) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Siberian and other Asian populations migrate to wintering grounds in South-East Asia and India (only crossing Japan on the northward return migration) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Some populations in South-East Asia, India, New Guinea and the Philippines do not migrate but are sedentary or locally nomadic in response to water levels (del Hoyo et al. 1996). This species is mainly solitary throughout the non-breeding season and on migration, occasionally occurring in flocks of not more than 10 individuals (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It also breeds singly or in loose neighbourhood groups spaced 7-200 m apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding During the breeding season this species shows a preference for bare or sparsely vegetated sandy and pebbly shores of shallow standing freshwater pools, lakes or slow-flowing rivers (Johnsgard, 1981, Cramp and Simmons 1983, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Grimmett et al. 1998), including river islands, dry, stony riverbeds, sand, shingle or silt flats (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996), dry wadis and dune slacks (Cramp and Simmons 1983). This species may also utilise temporary artificial habitats such as gravel pits (Ratcliffe 1974, Cramp and Simmons 1983, del Hoyo et al. 1996), sewage works, industrial wastelands (Cramp and Simmons 1983, del Hoyo et al. 1996) and refuse tips (Cramp and Simmons 1983, Hayman et al. 1986), and may use open arable land on clay soil in exceptional circumstances (Johnsgard, 1981) (resident populations in India it can be found on wet grassland and rice paddy-fields) (Grimmett et al. 1998). The species prefers lowland habitats and is rarely found above 800 m in Europe (Cramp and Simmons 1983, del Hoyo et al. 1996), but where river banks, dry riverbeds, or islets offer suitable habitat it will penetrate further upstream, reaching higher than 2,000 m in Afghanistan (e.g. in the mountains of Kashmir where it occurs along the pebbly banks of fast-flowing mountain torrents) (Johnsgard 1981), and even higher in the east Palearctic (Cramp and Simmons 1983). The species generally avoids rough or broken terrain, forest, cultivated land or pastures, and tall or dense vegetation including vegetated margins of inland waters (Cramp and Simmons 1983). It is also very rarely found on the coast, although it may occasionally visit saline inland pools and flats, intertidal areas on the seashore, mudflats, tidal creeks and brackish estuaries or lagoons (in India for example) (Cramp and Simmons 1983, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Grimmett et al. 1998). Non-breeding In its African wintering grounds this species favours extensive sandbanks (Johnsgard 1981), muddy and sandy shores of rivers and lakes, residual flood waters, short grassy areas on dry ground around villages or near water, airfields and pastures (Urban et al. 1986, Hockey et al. 2005). It less commonly inhabits coastal areas such as saltpans, estuaries, creeks or rainwater pools on dry salt-flats bordering mangroves (Urban et al. 1986). The species prefers lowland habitats during the winter as well as during the breeding season and is rarely found above 800 m in its wintering range (Hockey et al. 2005). Diet The species is carnivorous, its diet consisting mainly of insects such as beetles, flies (especially larvae and pupae), ants, bugs, mayfly and dragonfly larvae, caddisflies, crickets and larval Lepidoptera, as well as spiders, freshwater shrimps and other small crustaceans, mussels, worms and snails (Johnsgard, 1981, Cramp and Simmons 1983, Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Vegetation (such as the seeds of grasses, sedges, Polygonum and Compositae) is taken rarely and is likely to be ingested incidentally along with animal matter (Cramp and Simmons 1983). Breeding site The nest is a shallow scrape on loose sand, dry mud or on flat, bare rocks surrounded by mud or sand (Johnsgard, 1981, Urban et al. 1986), sometimes amongst sparse vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Grimmett et al. 1998) in the vicinity of water, and often on small islands (del Hoyo et al. 1996) or adjacent farmland (Hayman et al. 1986). Nesting pairs have also been recorded on flat gravelled roofs (Cramp and Simmons 1983).","This species is threatened primarily by the degradation and loss of its preferred habitats (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Barter 2002). Many of the species's breeding sites are also disturbed by human recreational activities (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Increased flood regulation and pollution from oil and tar along the Mediterranean coast and the River Jordan has resulted in the degradation of the breeding sites in those areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In China and South Korea important migrational staging areas around the coast of the Yellow Sea are being lost through land reclamation and degraded as a result of declining river flows (from water abstraction), increased pollution, unsustainable harvesting of benthic fauna and a reduction in the amount of sediment being carried into the area by the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers (Barter 2002, 2006). The species may also be susceptible to outbreaks of avian botulism (Hubalek et al. 2005), and is potentially at risk from exposure to DDT's in southern India (Tanabe et al. 1998).","The global population is estimated to number c.280,000-530,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2006). The European population is estimated at 134,000-262,000 pairs, which equates to 269,000-524,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). National population estimates include: c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in China; c.100-10,000 breeding pairs, c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration and c.1,000-10,000 wintering individuals in Taiwan; c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Korea; c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs, c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in Japan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Stable,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex II of the Bern Convention.Conservation Actions ProposedThe following information refers to the species's European range only: Recreation at breeding sites needs to be controlled.,Afrotropical|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The species starts to breed from April until June, nesting in solitary pairs or loose semi-colonial groups (especially in undisturbed areas) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It is a gregarious species (Hayman et al. 1986) and often roosts communally in flocks of several hundred close to its feeding areas (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996), occurring singly, in small (up to 50 individuals) or large flocks (up to 1,200-1,500 individuals) during the non-breeding season (Urban et al. 1986). Habitat Breeding The species breeds primarily on sand or shingle beaches either along the Arctic coast (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) or around coastal tundra pools or lakes (Johnsgard 1981). In the south of its range it may also breed inland on the Arctic tundra (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996) on muddy plains with stones or pebbles (Johnsgard 1981), on shores and sandbars of inland rivers, lakes, gravel pits or reservoirs (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), or on short grassland, farmland (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) and other well-drained sites (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species inhabits muddy, sandy or pebbly coasts in the tropics and subtropics (Johnsgard 1981) including estuaries (del Hoyo et al. 1996), tidal mudflats, sandflats and exposed coral reefs (Urban et al. 1986). It also frequents mudbanks or sandbanks along rivers and lakes (Urban et al. 1986), lagoons, saltmarshes, short grassland, farmland, flooded fields, gravel pits, reservoirs (del Hoyo et al. 1996), sewage works and saltpans during this season (Hockey et al. 2005). Diet Its diet consists of small crustaceans, molluscs, polycheate worms, isopods, amphipods, insects (e.g. ants, beetles, flies and fly larvae) and millipedes (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow scrape (del Hoyo et al. 1996) positioned near the high-water mark on shingle or sandy beaches (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986). The species is a solitary nester although it may breed at quite high densities in undisturbed areas, neighbouring nests spaced between 5 and 100 m apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996).

It breeds between May and June in colonies, usually of less than 20 pairs (rarely more than 100 pairs) and often close to other species (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). After breeding, it departs for its wintering grounds from July onwards, returning north again from late-March (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species is gregarious throughout the year, foraging in groups of 2-20 during the breeding season and congregating in large flocks offshore on passage and in the winter over shoals of predatory fish (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on fresh or brackish wetlands such as small pools, lakes, marshes, ditches, overgrown canals, quiet reaches of rivers, swampy meadows, peat bogs and rice-fields, showing a preference for well-vegetated areas with sparse, open emergent vegetation (e.g. Typha spp., sedge or reeds) and floating water-lilies, and with water 1-2 m deep (Flint et al. 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It generally avoids small marshland areas less than 4 ha in area (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding On passage, the species frequents inland wetlands including pools, ditches, reservoirs, lakes and sewage farms, as well as coastal habitats and estuaries (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). In winter, it is predominantly coastal, frequenting estuaries, saltmarshes, bays, coastlines and coastal lagoons as well as marine waters up to 400-600 km offshore (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet Breeding Its breeding diet consists predominantly of insects (e.g. chironomids, Odonata, Ephemeroptera and Coleoptera) as well as small fish and amphibians (e.g. tadpoles and frogs) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding On passage and during the winter, the species's diet consists largely of marine fish, although insects and crustaceans may also be taken (Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding site The nest may be a low compressed mound of plant matter placed in very shallow water or on a floating mat of aquatic vegetation over water more than 50 cm deep (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest may also be a shallow scrape on the ground amongst marsh vegetation (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds in small colonies and may forage up to 2-5 km from breeding sites (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","As Black Terns breed in wetlands on floating rafts of plant matter, the reduction of water level due to droughts and water abstraction for domestic and agricultural use represents a significant threat to the species due to loss of breeding habitat. The loss of rafts used for breeding represents a source of lost reproductive success, as shown by increases in breeding populations on the provisioning of artificial rafts (Gochfeld et al. 2018). Drought also has the potential to reduce reproductive success, as lower water levels allow the access of chicks by predators such as pigs. Encroachment of agriculture on wetlands has resulted in further loss and degradation of habitat. Introduction of the peacock bass to Lake Gutan in Panama resulted in the elimination of the Silverside, Meleniris chagresi, a significant prey species of the Black Tern, causing abandonment of this wintering site (Gochfeld et al. 2018).","The global population is estimated at 800,000-1,750,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

The East Asian population migrates along the eastern coast of the continent, whereas the populations in western Asia pass south overland through the Caspian region, the Middle East (del Hoyo et al. 1996) or between the Ural and Volga rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). The Finnish population flies across Eastern Europe and crosses the Mediterranean and Sahara non-stop (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding occurs between May and June (del Hoyo et al. 1996), after which the adults depart in early-July (the juveniles departing mainly in August) (Snow and Perrins 1998), to arrive in their wintering grounds between August and October (Urban et al. 1986). The return movement northward from Africa begins in late-March and continues throughout April (Snow and Perrins 1998). Many one-year-old (Urban et al. 1986) and other non-breeding birds remain in the wintering grounds throughout the northern summer (del Hoyo et al. 1996). This species is known to breed semi-collonially (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (as many as 10 nests have been found within a square kilometer) (Johnsgard 1981), but is mainly solitary outside of the breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). Occasionally it occurs in small flocks of 5-25 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996), or up to 300 at tidal roosting sites (Urban et al. 1986). The species is both a diurnal and nocturnal forager, but its nocturnal activities may by restricted to moonlit nights (Rohweder and Baverstock 1996). Habitat Breeding This species breeds in lowland valleys in northern boreal forest and tundra, especially on floodplains with flooded meadows and marshes, and where overgrown moist grasslands alternate with willow scrub (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It also frequents lakesides and marshy banks of streams, and extends to the coasts of sheltered seas in the Baltic (Snow and Perrins 1998). The species avoids mountains, fast rocky streams, steep or broken terrain, extensive open spaces and tall dense forest (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species inhabits tropical coasts, especially open intertidal estuaries and mudflats, as well as coral reefs, sandy and pebbly beaches, sandbars and mudlfats at river mouths, coastal swamps, saltpans (del Hoyo et al. 1996), coastal lagoons and saltmarsh creeks (Johnsgard 1981). It can occasionally also be found up to 10 km inland around brackish pools and riverbeds, and often forms communal roosts in the branches of mangroves (del Hoyo et al. 1996). During migration the species may stop-over at inland freshwater wetlands (del Hoyo et al. 1996), such as muddy lakes or river edges (Urban et al. 1986). Diet Breeding On its breeding grounds the diet of this species consists mainly of adult and larval midges (Diptera) as well as seeds (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding In its wintering grounds and on migration the diet of this species is more varied, consisting of a variety of insects, small molluscs, crustaceans (including crabs), spiders and annelid worms (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression close to water either in the open, or sheltered by short grasses (Urban et al. 1986).","In China and South Korea important migrational staging areas of this species around the coast of the Yellow Sea are being lost through land reclamation, and degraded as a result of declining river flows (from water abstraction), increased pollution, unsustainable harvesting of benthic fauna and a reduction in the amount of sediment being carried into the area by the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers (Barter 2002, Barter 2006). This species is also potentially at risk from exposure to DDT's in southern India (Tanabe et al. 1998). Within its European range, the breeding success of this species is not well known, but there are indications that an overall increase of common gulls, crows and mammalian predators has led to increased nest predation. Anthropogenic habitats in the wood processing industry are subject to unpredictable changes that can drive small range populations to extinction within a short period of time. Historically there are indications of illegal egg collection at the European breeding sites (HELCOM 2012).","The global population is estimated to number c.160,000-1,200,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015), while national population sizes have been estimated at c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration and &lt; c.50 wintering individuals in Taiwan and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009). The European population is estimated at 15,500-50,700 pairs, which equates to 30,900-101,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Decreasing,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe following information refers to the species's European range only: Bern Convention Appendix II.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour Although populations breeding near the equator are largely sedentary (Richards 1990), northern populations are strongly migratory and disperse after breeding before migrating southwards (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species breeds between April and June (northern Hemisphere) or between September and December (southern Hemisphere) (del Hoyo et al. 1996) in large dense monospecific colonies or as single pairs or small groups (2-3 pairs) amidst large colonies of other species (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It is not a highly gregarious species outside of the breeding season but may aggregate into flocks on passage, and during the winter it may feed in loose congregations in rich fishing areas or at nightly roost sites (Urban et al.1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat The breeding, passage and wintering habitats of this species are similar, although during the winter it is largely confined to the coast (Shuford and Craig 2002). It frequents sheltered sea coasts, estuaries, inlets, bays, harbours, coastal lagoons, saltmarshes and saltpans, also occurring inland on fresh or saline wetlands including large lakes, inland seas, large rivers, creeks, floodlands, reservoirs and sewage ponds (Flint et al. 1984, Martin and Randall 1987, Richards 1990, Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). When breeding the species shows a preference for nesting on sandy, shell-strewn or shingle beaches, sand-dunes, flat rock-surfaces, sheltered reefs or islands with sparse vegetation and flat or gently sloping margins surrounded by clear, shallow, undisturbed waters (Flint et al. 1984, Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It also forms winter roosts on sandbars, mudflats and banks of shell (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of fish 5-25 cm in length also including the eggs and young of other birds, carrion, aquatic invertebrates (e.g. crayfish), flying insects and earthworms (Flint et al. 1984, Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Shuford and Craig 2002). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression in the sand, gravel, shells, sparse vegetation or dried mud of ridges, beaches, dunes, flat rocky or stony islets, banks, islands or reefs in seas, lakes and large rivers, dredge spoil piles and islands in reservoirs (Flint et al. 1984, Richards 1990, Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species nests in large colonies or as single pairs or small groups amidst colonies of other species, neighbouring nests placed between 0.7 and 4 m part (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species may forage up to 60 km from the site of the breeding colony (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Management information Management for this species should include a number of measures such as habitat and vegetation management, the use of artificial nest substrates, predator management (e.g. control of gull populations) and the minimisation of disturbance (Shuford and Craig 2002). Habitat and vegetation management may include the creation of artificial islands with calm water on their leeward side to allow the growth of submerged vegetation and fish spawning habitats, or alternatively the creation of floating artificial nesting-rafts (e.g. barges covered with sand) (Shuford and Craig 2002).","Human disturbance represents a significant threat to this species. Caspian Tern colonies are especially vulnerable to disturbance during the early courtship and incubation stages, during which human visitation results in the flushing of the whole colony, potentially leading to nest or colony abandonment (Cuthbert and Wires 1999 per Shuford and Craig 2002). The effect of disturbance during research activities has been well quantified, with activities such as ringing and cannon-netting representing a large proportion of the reproductive failure in colonies studied (Shuford and Craig 2002). Disturbance due to recreational activities are less well quantified but likely also significant (Shuford and Craig 2002). Much of the loss of reproductive success due to human disturbance occurs through gull predation of chicks during the few seconds of panic flight in which the eggs and chicks of a nest are left exposed (Shuford and Craig 2002). Historically, overexploitation has resulted in large population declines through the collection of eggs and adults for food and feathers (Shuford and Craig 2002).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour Northern populations of this species are migratory, with those breeding in the western Palearctic travelling on a broad front across the Sahara (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and those breeding in North American travelling on a narrow front along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Post-breeding southward movements occur from September to October and return northward movements occur from March to May (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Tropical populations are not migratory but may undergo seasonal post-breeding dispersive movements (del Hoyo et al. 1992). In temperate regions breeding occurs in the local spring, with tropical and subtropical nesting generally coinciding with the rains (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species usually nests in small numbers (Snow and Perrins 1998) in single- or mixed-species colonies (del Hoyo et al. 1992), although sometimes groups may reach several thousand pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1992). When nesting within mixed-species colonies the species tends to form monospecific clusters (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species's aggregatory behaviour outside of the breeding season varies much throughout its range, some populations (e.g. in America) remaining highly gregarious throughout the year (Snow and Perrins 1998) and gathering in flocks of hundreds or even thousands to roost (del Hoyo et al. 1992), others (e.g. Palearctic breeders) being largely solitary except when roosting or on migration (Snow and Perrins 1998) (roosting flocks of 2-6 to 200 are known in Africa (Brown et al. 1992) and small flocks occur on migration) (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species is largely crepuscular and nocturnal, but may feed diurnally especially during the breeding season (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Habitat The species inhabits fresh, brackish or saline waters with aquatic vegetation and bamboo or trees (e.g. pine, oak or mangroves) for roosting and nesting in (del Hoyo et al. 1992), showing a preference for islands or predator-free areas for nesting sites (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occupies the forested margins of shallow rivers, streams, lagoons, pools, ponds, lakes, marshes and mangroves and may feed on pastures, reservoirs, canals, aquaculture ponds (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and rice-fields (up to 96 % of a colony's food resources may be taken from nearby rice-fields) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). On migration the species may also frequent dry grasslands or marine coasts (del Hoyo et al. 1992), kelp beds (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and estuaries (Hockey et al. 2005). It breeds up to 4,800 m (Chile) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) but is more common at elevations of up to c.2,000 m (Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet It is an opportunistic feeder taking fish, frogs, tadpoles, turtles, snakes, lizards, adult and larval insects (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (e.g. beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, crickets, flies and dragonflies) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), spiders, crustaceans, molluscs, leeches, small rodents, bats and the eggs and chicks of other bird species (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is platform constructed of sticks and vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) placed 2-50 m above water or on dry ground near water (Snow and Perrins 1998) in trees, bushes, reedbeds, on cliff ledges (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (overhanging rivers) (Hockey et al. 2005) and on the ground (del Hoyo et al. 1992) in protected sites (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species nests close together in single- and mixed-species colonies (del Hoyo et al. 1992) with as many as 20-30 pairs in the same tree (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Colony sites may be reused in consecutive years or flocks may move to new sites (usually such movements are a result of nesting trees being destroyed due to the colony's nesting activities) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Colony sites are dispersed throughout the landscape in relation to distance from feeding areas (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Management information A study carried out in north-west Italy suggests that existing nesting sites should be protected and that breeding habitats should be actively managed in order to maintain suitable habitat characteristics (Fasola and Alieri 1992). The creation of a network of new nesting sites spaced at 4-10 km in relation to available foraging habitats in zones currently without suitable nesting sites is also recommended (Fasola and Alieri 1992).","The species is threatened by wetland drainage and destruction (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and by drought in wintering areas (Hafner and Kushlan 2002). It is highly susceptible to pesticides (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kwon et al. 2004, Kushlan and Hancock 2005) such as organophosphates, carbamates (Kwon et al. 2004) and DDE (a breakdown product of DDT) which negatively affect hatching success (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). There are also cases of genetic damage to chicks as a result of petroleum contamination (Custer 2000). The species is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006) and Newcastle disease so may be threatened by future outbreaks (Kuiken et al. 2006). It is also persecuted (anti-predation killing) at aquaculture facilities due to its depredation on fish stocks (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), and has suffered declines due to the exploitation of chicks from nesting colonies in the past (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Utilisation Chicks of the species are still taken for food in some areas (e.g. Madagascar) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005, Hafner 200) and adults are hunted and traded at traditional medicine markets in Nigeria (Nikolaus 2001).","The global population is estimated to number c.570,000-3,730,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 60,000-86,100 pairs, which equates to 120,000-172,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). National population estimates include: c.100,000-1 million breeding pairs, &gt;c.10,000 individuals on migration and &gt;c.10,000 wintering individuals in China; c.100,000-1 million breeding pairs in Taiwan; c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in Korea and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Japan (Brazil 2009).",Decreasing,"","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is listed on Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, Annex II of the Bern Convention and Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species, under which it is covered by the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA).Conservation Actions ProposedThe following information refers to the species's European range only: A study carried out in north-west Italy suggests that existing nesting sites should be protected and that breeding habitats should be actively managed in order to maintain suitable habitat characteristics (Fasola and Alieri 1992).

It is also found in subalpine tundra in high mountains (Copete 2016). In its European breeding range this species inhabits zonal dwarf birch tundra in watersheds and on mountain slopes. In the polar Urals it occurs up to 300 m Asl. It normally occurs in drier and cooler regions than those favoured by Emberiza schoeniclus. Breeding takes place in June and July. The nest is placed on the ground or low in a bush. The clutch, usually three to five eggs, is incubated by the female. The incubation period is 11 days; nestlings are fed by both parents and leave the nest after 11 days.

In the south of its range it is more frequently found in open country, and has been recorded as breeding in small isolated colonies away from humans. In Central Asia and Afghanistan, the species is mainly a summer visitor, where it is confined to open country in the area of overlap with resident P. montanus; farther north, in Siberia, the two species live side by side in built-up areas. It breeds from February to September, although timing varies with latitude. It breeds in loose colonies and nests are constructed mainly of plant stems, lined with feathers or other soft material. Its preferred site is a hole in a building, cliff or tree. Clutches are two to five eggs. The diet is mainly vegetable material, particularly seeds of grasses, cultivated cereals and low herbs, but also buds, berries and wide range of household scraps. It does take some animal matter (c. 10% of the diet in summer months). The species is mostly resident with some limited withdrawal of populations breeding at high latitudes and altitudes to less cold areas in winter (Summers-Smith et al. 2015).","Declines in western Europe have been attributed to a decrease in availability of suitable invertebrate food necessary for rearing young as well as possible reduced fitness of those young that fledge successfully (Summers-Smith et al. 2015). This may be as a result of changes in agricultural practices such as the increased use of pesticides and herbicides and the autumn sowing of cereals, which have lead to decreases in food for this species (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997).","Rich et al.

The timing of breeding varies geographically, occurring all year round (del Hoyo et al. 1992) or coinciding with the rains in the tropics (Johnsgard 1993) and peaking between April and June in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species breeds in mixed-species colonies (del Hoyo et al. 1992) of 10-500 pairs (Nelson 2005) (occasionally up to 1,000 pairs) (Brown et al. 1982), the size of the colony depending upon the extent of nearby feeding areas (Nelson 2005). It is usually a solitary feeder (Brown et al. 1982) but may form large fishing flocks in some areas (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It also roosts communally at nesting sites or in major feeding areas and flies in flocks of varying sizes (Brown et al. 1982). Off the coasts of eastern Jutland and of Læsø, Denmark, flocks sizes of up to 890 individuals were observed (Petersen et al 2003). Feeding is exclusively diurnal. Habitat The species frequents both coastal and inland habitats (Brown et al. 1982, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Johnsgard 1993, Snow and Perrins 1998, Nelson 2005). In marine environments it occurs in sheltered coastal areas on estuaries (del Hoyo et al. 1992), saltpans, coastal lagoons (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Johnsgard 1993), mangrove swamps, deltas (Johnsgard 1993) and coastal bays (Brown et al. 1982), requiring rocky shores, cliffs and islets for nesting (del Hoyo et al. 1992) but generally avoiding deep water and rarely extending far offshore (Snow and Perrins 1998). It also inhabits fresh, brackish or saline inland wetlands (Nelson 2005) including lakes, reservoirs, wide rivers, flood waters (del Hoyo et al. 1992), deep marshes with open water, swamps and oxbow lakes (Johnsgard 1993), requiring trees, bushes, reedbeds or bare ground for nesting (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and avoiding overgrown, small, very shallow or very deep waters (Nelson 2005). Diet The species' diet consists predominantly of fish, including sculpins, Capelin, gadids (Gremillet et al 2004) and flatfish (Leopold et al 1998) as well as crustaceans, amphibians (del Hoyo et al. 1992), molluscs and nestling birds (Brown et al. 1982). At sea the species preys mostly on bottom-dwelling fish, occasionally also taking shoaling fish in deeper waters (del Hoyo et al. 1992). It is a generalist, having been shown to feed on at least 22 different fish species (Gremillet 1997). Breeding site The nest varies from a depression (Nelson 2005) to a platform of sticks, reeds and seaweed (del Hoyo et al. 1992). On the coast the species nests on inshore islands, cliffs, stacks, amongst boulders and occasionally on artificial structures (del Hoyo et al. 1992), also nesting inland on trees or bushes, in reedbeds or on bare ground (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species usually nests in mixed-species colonies, often re-using sites and nests from year to year (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Foraging range The Great Cormorant has a largely neritic distribution. At sea, it rarely wanders far from the coast, preferring sheltered areas and estuaries where it normally feeds in shallow water. It preys mainly on benthic fish species. It is rarely observed to dive below 10 m (BirdLife International 2000, Petersen et al 2003, Gremillet et al 2004) although it has been recorded down to -35 m (Gremillet et al 2004). Several studies have shown that this species is able to forage up to 20-25 km from its wintering roosts or breeding colonies. Most foraging trips are confined to within 10 km of the colony (Gremillet 1997, BirdLife International 2000, Petersen et al 2003), but trips up to a 35 km radius have been recorded (Gremillet 1997). Off the coasts of eastern Jutland and at Læsø, Denmark, 75% of recorded birds were seen within 3 km of the coast (Petersen et al 2003). Preferred habitats include granitic boulder, since this is the favoured habitat of labrids, the commonest prey in the diet (Gremillet 1997). The species is also likely to select sandy areas with a high abundance of flatfish or rocky substrates where gobies, wrasse, sea scorpions and small gadoids occur (BirdLife International 2000).","Due to the species' foraging behaviour (shallow diving) and habit of hunting within purse-seine and gill-nets, the species is particularly susceptible to bycatch. Although, these unintentional effects of fishing activities are not currently found to be driving colony declines, they could present problems on both local and global scales if populations were to decline (Bregnballe and Frederiksen 2006).","The global population is estimated to number c.1,400,000-2,100,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

In Europe, the it can be found along most of the Atlantic coast, as well as throught the Mediterranean and in large areas of Eastern Europe. In Africa, it can be found wintering of the northern coast as well as along the Nile, and breeding year-round on the north-west coast, in pockets of central-east Africa and in South Africa. Summer breeding occurs in patches through much of central Asia up to eastern China, year-round wintering occurs in India and southern China, and birds can be found wintering in south-east Asia.

It breeds from late-May to August (Hayman et al. 1986) in solitary pairs, occasionally forming loose colonies where suitable habitat is restricted (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species leaves the breeding grounds between late-June and early-September (Hayman et al. 1986), migrating in gregarious flocks and wintering at sea in flocks of 20-100 (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding The species breeds in the Arctic on coastal and inland tundra, forest tundra and alpine tundra near lakes, pools (del Hoyo et al. 1996), ponds, lagoons, streams or other permanent water-bodies (Johnsgard 1981) with marshy margins overgrown with grass, sedge or moss (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996) in freshwater marshes and bogs (Hayman et al. 1986). It may also frequent coastal moorland, flood-plains and islets in large rivers, and in Iceland it commonly nests on sparsely vegetated lava deserts (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding On passage the species frequents inland saline and hypersaline lakes (del Hoyo et al. 1996) as well as reservoirs, sewage-ponds and coastal marshes (Hayman et al. 1986). During the winter it is largely pelagic however, foraging at sea in upwelling zones and marine areas with a high abundance of plankton (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Breeding In its breeding range its diet consists of insects (especially adult and larval Diptera, beetles, caddisflies, ants and Hemiptera) and other small invertebrates (e.g. snails, crustaceans and annelid worms) (del Hoyo et al. 1996), larval amphibians (tadpoles) (Johnsgard 1981) and seeds (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding On passage the species may take larval brine-flies (Ephydra spp.) from saline lakes, but when feeding pelagically during the winter it feeds on zooplankton (e.g. euphausiids and calanoid copepods) and other floating planktonic particles (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow scrape on bare ground or amongst sparse vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1996) in sedge thickets or damp, grassy or hummocky areas close to water (Flint et al. 1984). Management information In the UK management regimes to benefit the species include increasing the area of open water in mires by digging small pools, controlling water-levels and providing tussocky vegetation suitable for nesting (through grazing by ponies and cattle) (O'Brien et al. 1997).","The species faces ongoing changes to habitat caused by increasing temperatures and impact of climate change (Huntley et al. 2007). The population of Red-necked Phalaropes in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, dropped from 2,000,000-3,000,000 birds in the late 1970s to early 1980s to virtual absence by 1989 (Nisbet and Veit 2015). This is thought to have been caused by the effect of 1982/83 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event on the population’s wintering area off Ecuador and Peru, likely due to a change in currents reducing the availability of their plankton prey (Nisbet and Veit 2015). A similar, albeit less extreme, decline was observed in many other Red-necked Phalarope populations both in Europe and the Americas (Nisbet and Veit 2015). This implies the species may be adversely affected by the predicted increase in ENSO events (Timmermann et al. 1999). Habitat destruction, including from peat extraction could also impact the species during its breeding stage. Coastal dredging could also reduce available habitat and prey while at sea (O'Brien et al. 1997). It is vulnerable to invasive alien predators (Biodiversity in Sweden 2012), as well as human disturbance on its breeding grounds.","The global population is estimated to number c.3,600,000-4,500,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

In addition northern breeding populations are fully migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and may travel on a broad front (e.g. across the Sahara) (Brown et al. 1982). Northern and southern breeding populations breed during the local spring, whilst breeding elsewhere coincides with the rains (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species nests in mixed-species colonies, either in small groups (e.g. 5-100 pairs in Africa) (Brown et al. 1982) or in large aggregations of thousands of pairs, and during the winter or dry seasons the species usually forages in small flocks (Hancock et al. 1992, del Hoyo et al. 1992) of up to 30 indivduals (Brown et al. 1982). It often roosts communally at night in large groups (sometimes thousands of individuals) with other species, occasionally in trees far from wetland feeding sites (Brown et al. 1982). Habitat The species feeds in very shallow water (Hancock et al. 1992) and nests in freshwater or brackish wetlands with tall dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reeds or rushes) and low trees or bushes (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1992). It shows a preference for marshes at the edges of lakes and rivers (Hancock et al. 1992), as well as lagoons, flood-plains, wet meadows (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1992), swamps (del Hoyo et al. 1992), reservoirs (Hancock et al. 1992), sewage ponds, rice-fields and irrigated cultivation (Marchant and Higgins 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1992). It less often occurs in coastal locations such as estuaries, deltas, saltmarshes (Hancock et al. 1992) and coastal lagoons (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Roosting sites are often large trees that may be far from water (Brown et al. 1982, del Hoyo et al. 1992). Diet The diet of the species varies seasonally depending on what is available (Hancock et al. 1992). It takes adult and larval insects (e.g. aquatic beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers, crickets, flies and caddisflies), worms, leeches, molluscs (e.g. snails and mussels), crustaceans (e.g. crabs and crayfish) and occasionally fish, frogs, tadpoles, lizards, small snakes and nestling birds (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is a platform of twigs and vegetation usually positioned less than 1 m above water (occasionally up to 7 m) in tall dense stands of emergent vegetation (e.g. reeds or rushes), low trees or bushes over water (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","The species is threatened by wetland habitat degradation and loss (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998) through drainage (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Hancock et al. 1992) for irrigation and hydroelectric power production (Balian et al. 2002), clearing, grazing, burning, increased salinity, groundwater extraction and invasion by exotic plants (Marchant and Higgins 1990). It is also threatened locally by hunting (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998), disturbance and pesticides (del Hoyo et al. 1992), and is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006).","The global population is estimated at 230,000-2,220,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

The species breeds between June and July (Hayman et al. 1986) after which it departs the breeding grounds from late-August or early-September (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It may forage singly or in flocks of one hundred or more individiuals, occurring in small groups of 3-7 individuals at stopover sites on the northward passage but in large flocks on the southward passage (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding It breeds on inland Arctic habitats including shrub tundra, montane tundra and stony well-drained uplands with mosses and lichens (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding The species occurs on the shores of lakes and rivers when on passage in the U.S.S.R. (Hayman et al. 1986), but outside of the breeding season in generally occupies coastal areas, foraging in coastal fields and prairies with short grass, ploughed fields (del Hoyo et al. 1996), coastal freshwater pools (Hayman et al. 1986), saltmarshes, beaches, open mud and sandflats (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and reefs (Hayman et al. 1986). It roosts on the same habitats used for foraging, as well as on exposed sandy beaches and exposed rocks (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of insects, molluscs, worms, crustaceans and spiders, although berries are also important during the breeding season on the Arctic tundra (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow scrape positioned on a dry site amongst hummocks, lichen, Dryas spp. or moss (del Hoyo et al. 1996).

Quarries are important nesting sites (Tucker and Heath 1994) and birds may use other man-made habitats including road and railway cuttings and building work excavations. Suitability of breeding sites depends on erosion which both creates new sites and destroys old ones (Turner 2004). Breeding occurs between late April and August usually with two clutches of between three and six eggs. Burrows are excavated by both male and female but male initiates the process. Erosion at breeding sites is vital for creating new nest sites which birds prefer. Sand martins may roost in reedbeds. They forage approximately 15 m above ground (Turner 2004) feeding mainly on insects but also taking spiders (Tucker and Heath 1994, Turner 2004). Important foraging habitats include water-bodies, grassland and farmland (Turner 2004). Urban and forested areas are less important. This species is migratory with Eurasian birds typically wintering in the Sahel zone and East Africa south to Mozambique (Tucker and Heath 1994). Breeding birds in North America migrate to South America (Turner 2004). Adult birds migrate soon after breeding. Juveniles roam over a wide area. Most adult birds return to the same breeding colony in subsequent years (Turner 2004).","Breeding sites are generally ephemeral and can often be lost through human activities (e.g. flood control, erosion control on rivers). In Europe, it is often dependent on artificial breeding sites such as quarries (Turner 2004), however quarry work can adversely affect breeding, though workers often take measures to prevent this. The use of pesticides causing declines in prey species, may impact the species (Tucker and Heath 1994). In the past droughts in wintering areas have caused severe large-scale population declines in western Europe (Tucker and Heath 1994, Turner 2004).","The European population is estimated at 3,640,000-8,000,000 pairs, which equates to 7,280,000-16,000,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is a strongly migratory coastal seabird (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). It breeds between April and June in solitary pairs or colonially in groups of up to several thousand pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Palearctic breeders migrate south after breeding between August and October, returning to the breeding grounds in March or April (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species may moult on arrival in its the wintering grounds, when it may become vulnerable to human exploitation (van Halewyn and Norton 1984). It is gregarious throughout the year (Snow and Perrins 1998). Shoals of fish may attract dense feeding flocks, although it otherwise feeds singly or in small loose groups (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). In some cases, it is territorial; in Massachusetts, feeding territories usually consist of linear strips of shoreline, which are occupied and defended regularly by both members of a pair. The prevalence of territoriality at feeding sites varies between colonies and is related to food species availability (Nisbet 1983). Most individuals forage 5-10 km from breeding colonies, occasionally feeding at sea 15 km offshore (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Common Terns forage over fresh water as well as marine habitats, and often follow predatory fish, waiting for panicking baitfish to surface. They sometimes forage in mixed-species flocks together with other terns (Safina 1990, Brenninkmeijer et al. 2002). Habitat Breeding The species breeds in a wide variety of habitats in coastal and inland areas from sea-level to heights of greater than 4,000 m (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Along the coast, it shows a preference for nesting on flat rock surfaces on inshore islands, open shingle and sandy beaches, dunes and spits, vegetated inter-dune areas, sandy, rocky, shell-strewn or well-vegetated islands in estuaries and coastal lagoons, saltmarshes, mainland peninsulas and grassy plateaus atop coastal cliffs (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Inland, it may nest in similar habitats, including sand or shingle lakes shores, shingle banks in rivers, sandy, rocky, shell-strewn or well-vegetated islands in lakes and rivers, sand- or gravel-pits, marshes, ponds, grassy areas and patches of dredged soil (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding The species winters on sheltered coastal waters, estuaries and along large rivers, occupying harbours, jetties, piers, beaches and coastal wetlands including lagoons, rivers, lakes, swamps and saltworks, mangroves and saltmarshes (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). During this season, it roosts on unvegetated sandy beaches, shores of estuaries or lagoons, sandbars and rocky shores (Higgins and Davies 1996). Diet The species is opportunistic, its diet consisting predominantly of small fish and occasionally planktonic crustaceans and insects (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression on open substrates with little or no vegetation placed near a vertical object (e.g. rock, shell, plant or artefact) to provide shelter for chicks and to facilitate nest identification (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Nest sites include the edges of bare sand amongst vegetation, rocks or logs, open areas on the margins of vegetation on beaches, the edges of mats of vegetation in marshes, and grassy or rocky substrates on rocky islets (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species will also readily nest on artificial rafts (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Foraging range Studies have observed foraging birds at up to 37 km from the nearest colony (Cramp 1985, BirdLife International 2000). However, although Common Terns tend to range further than Roseate Terns (BirdLife International 2000), most are observed within 10 km of a breeding colony (Becker et al. 1993, Wanless et al. 1998, Newton and Crowe 1999). At various sites, visual observations, e.g. of direction of flight, also suggest that most feeding trips are to sites within 10 km of the colony (Hopkins and Wiley 1972, Duffy 1986, Uttley et al. 1989, Burness et al. 1994, BirdLife International 2000), although birds in these studies were recorded at a maximum of 18 km from the colony (Duffy 1986). Radio-tagging at the Wadden Sea has shown that birds forage at a mean radius of at least 6.3 km (Becker et al. 1993), although the total distance travelled by individuals on these foraging trips is much greater, around 26-30 km. In Massachusetts, feeding territories tend to be located in shallow water up to 75 m from shore, and may be at least 8.5 km away from the breeding colony (Lemmetyinen 1973, Nisbet 1983, BirdLife International 2000), as well as areas where depth changes abruptly and tidal currents are strong, which presumably produces much upwelling and mixing of cold, deep water with warmer surface water (Safina 1990). Birds lower the rate at which they attempt to forage when windspeed is high (Taylor 1983).","During the breeding season, the species is vulnerable to human disturbance at nesting colonies (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Blokpoel and Scharf 1991), with sources of disturbance including off-road vehicles, recreation, motor-boats, personal watercraft and dogs (van Halewyn and Norton 1984, Hyde 1997, Burger 1998, Gochfeld et al. 2018). The flooding of nest sites as a result of naturally fluctuating water levels can also result in complete breeding failure of the effected colony (Buckley and Buckley 1984, Hyde 1997, Gochfeld et al. 2018). Previously, this species has experienced significant declines due to egging, hunting and the millinery trade (Gochfeld et al. 2018). Although in most places populations have recovered, hunting remains a significant problem in some areas, including parts of West Africa, where human predation results in a fledging success rate of only 12% (Gochfeld et al. 2018).","The global population is estimated to number c.1,600,000-3,600,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 316,000-605,000 breeding pairs (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"This species has a circumpolar distribution and can be found breeding in most of Europe, Asia and North America, except the in the extreme north. It winters further south, being found along the coast and inland of South America down to the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), along the coast of Africa (excluding northern Africa), along parts of the Arabian Peninsula, the coast of India and throughout much of south-east Asia and Australasia, excluding New Zealand (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayManagement techniques used to increase the breeding numbers and reproductive success of the species in the Great Lakes region of North America include creating artificial nesting sites, vegetation management, enhancement of existing nesting habitat, using models and vocalisation to attract breeding pairs and predator control (e.g. mammal-exclusion, destruction of gull nests, direct predator removal, or preventative measures against gull nesting) (Blokpoel and Scharf 1991). A conservation scheme for the protection of gull and tern breeding colonies in coastal lagoons and deltas (e.g. Po Delta, Italy) involves protection from human disturbance, prevention of erosion of islet complexes, habitat maintenance and the creation of new islets for nest sites (Fasola and Canova 1996). Habitat restoration work was carried out on Praia Islet in the Azores Archipelago, including rabbit eradication, control of soil erosion, reintroduction of native plants and installation of nest boxes for the species (Bried et al. 2009).Conservation Actions ProposedMaintain bare islets with 30-100 % cover of low vegetation (sward heights less than 20 cm) or artificially create some as nesting sites (Fasola and Canova 1996). Offer artificial nesting rafts to promote breeding in areas where there is a lack of suitable nesting habitat or where human disturbance is a particular threat (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Use controlled fire to expose the ground surface in areas where vegetation succession is proceeding too far towards closed vegetation stages (Hyde 1997). Enhance breeding productivity by deterring predatory gulls, either by culling or by the use of non-lethal harassment techniques, e.g. egg and nest destruction, conspicuous human observers, gull displacement walks, and pyrotechnics (Guillemette and Brousseau 2001, Donehower et al. 2007).",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The species is mostly sedentary, with post-breeding dispersal of juveniles (Bruce et al. 2014).","Within the species's northern range, the causes of decline include loss and fragmentation of grassland foraging habitat, intensification of agricultural practices, urbanization, and road development which is also linked to road mortalities. It also suffers from severe winters. Increased mechanization of farmland in its northern range has meant the loss of important foraging sites, such as stockyards and stables, and the loss of abandoned farm buildings suitable for nest-sites. Organochlorine pesticides in the 1950s and 1960s and rodenticides in the 1970s and 1980s had disastrous effects on many owl populations in Europe, particularly north-west Europe, parts of North America and north-east Australia (Bruce et al. 2014).","The European population is estimated at 111,000-230,000 pairs, which equates to 222,000-460,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

It breeds from May onwards in solitary pairs or in single- and mixed-species colonies of up to 300 pairs (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996) or more (e.g. 1,000 pairs in Baltic region (Snow and Perrins 1998)). Outside of the breeding season the species remains gregarious, foraging in flocks of up to one hundred or more individuals during the winter, flock sizes depending upon the habitat and conditions (Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding The species breeds along the coast (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) and inland (Flint et al. 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) in a variety of sites not necessarily close to wetlands (del Hoyo et al. 1996). On the coast it nests on grassy and rocky cliff-ledges (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), grassy slopes (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998), inshore rocky islets, islands and stacks (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), and on sand and shingle beaches, banks and dunes (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998) amongst tide-wrack or flood debris (Snow and Perrins 1998). Inland the species nests on small islands in freshwater and saline lakes (Flint et al. 1984), shingle bars or small islets in streams or rivers (Richards 1990), islets, artificial structures and shores of artificial waterbodies with short, sparse vegetation (Skorka et al. 2006), and on bogs (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), marshes (del Hoyo et al. 1996), meadows (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and grass or heather moorland near small pools (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998) or lakes (Snow and Perrins 1998). After the young fledge the species often disperses to coasts, tidal estuaries, agricultural land and reservoirs (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season it occupies similar habitats to when it is breeding, although it may occur more frequently along the coast during this period (Snow and Perrins 1998) on estuaries with low salinities, sandy beaches and estuarine mudflats (Bukacinski and Bukacinska 2003). Diet Its diet consists of earthworms, insects, aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (e.g. planktonic crustaceans (del Hoyo et al. 1996), crayfish and molluscs (Flint et al. 1984)) and small fish (del Hoyo et al. 1996). During the spring the species will also take agricultural grain (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and often scavenges (Bukacinski and Bukacinska 2003). Breeding site The nest is a shallow cup of vegetation placed on grass, rock, sand, shingle, earth or floating and marshy vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1996) in a variety of coastal and inland locations (Flint et al. 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species may also nest off the ground on artificial structures, in nest-boxes and in trees (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Management information The species may benefit from the removal of introduced predators such as American mink Neovison vison from small breeding islands (Nordström et al. 2003), and has been known to nest on artificial rafts intended to encourage other species (e.g. Common Tern Sterna hirundo) to breed (Bukacinski and Bukacinska 2003).","In the past this species has been thought to be threatened by habitat loss and disturbance through human activities (including tourism, research, fishing and development) and predation by invasive American Mink Neovison vison (Bukacinski and Bukacinska 2003). Currently, it seems as though none of these represent a significant threat to the population.","The global population is estimated to number c.2,500,000-3,700,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015). The European population is estimated at 640,000-1,080,000 pairs, which equates to 1,280,000-2,160,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). National population sizes have been estimated at c.100-10,000 breeding pairs and c.50-1,000 wintering individuals in China and c.10,000-100,000 breeding pairs and c.1,000-10,000 individuals on migration in Russia (Brazil 2009).",Unknown,"This species breeds in northern Europe, northern Asia and north-west North America.

Other populations, e.g. from Greenland, only disperse locally along the coast after breeding (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species breeds from mid May to July in solitary pairs or in small single- or mixed-species colonies of up to several hundred pairs (Richards 1990, Gaston 1991, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), often near nesting Larus hyperboreus (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In late July, the species may move to coastal feeding areas. It departs from the breeding grounds in August or September (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and arrives on its wintering grounds between late October and December, where it remains until April (Alderfer 2006). It is gregarious throughout the year (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Olsen and Larsson 2003) and may occur in large flocks at favoured sites during the winter (Olsen and Larsson 2003, Sibley 2003), although it usually occurs in small numbers amongst larger flocks of other gull species (Sibley 2003). It forages in the intertidal zone, but may also follow fishing boats with other species of gull (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding For breeding the species requires rocky coasts and fjords with steep cliffs (Richards 1990, Gaston 1991, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Olsen and Larsson 2003). It occurs up to 3 km inland along Arctic shores, offshore stacks and undisturbed low, rocky islands (Godfrey 1979, Gaston 1991, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding During the winter, the species frequents a variety of habitats surrounding coastal shores and estuaries, often foraging around fishing harbours, inland reservoirs, refuse dumps and settlements (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Olsen and Larsson 2003, Alderfer 2006). It may also occur on inland freshwater lakes, rivers, flooded land and occasionally agricultural fields especially when on migration (Godfrey 1979, Olsen and Larsson 2003), although it generally avoids freshwater habitats (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of small fish (e.g. salmon Salmo spp., sprat Sprattus spp. and herring Clupea spp.) and marine invertebrates, as well as bird eggs and chicks (especially of Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla), seeds and fruits (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding site The nest is constructed of dry grass, seaweed and moss. It is placed on large, flat ledges of steep coastal cliffs greater than 100-200 m in height, on offshore stacks, surrounding a near-coastal freshwater sites or on the ground on undisturbed low coastal islands (Godfrey 1979, Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Olsen and Larsson 2003).","The species is extensively hunted by local people in Greenland, and non-native predators could also pose a hazard during the breeding season (Burger and Gochfeld 1996).

During the breeding season it favours well-spaced mature trees to younger trees and bushes, and thus has adapted well to avenues, parks, gardens, orchards and other man-made habitats, as well as occupying many types of deciduous or coniferous woodland. It is also found at woodland edges, in forest glades, clearings and burnt patches, and in trees along streams, rivers and edges of standing water. The breeding season in Europe is from mid-May to mid-August, mainly May-June farther east and April-July in north-west Africa. The nest is a bulky cup of loosely piled fine twigs, rootlets, dead leaves, pieces of decaying bark, moss, dry grass, lichens and fibres, bound with hair and lined with hair, feathers and finer material. It is sited above the ground on a natural or artificial ledge, in a niche, at the base of a basket-shaped tuft of twigs against a tree trunk, in a hole in a tree, branch or stump, in creeper against a tree or wall, or on top of a flat branch. Clutches are two to seven eggs, but most commonly four to six. It is insectivorous, feeding mainly on flying insects, especially flies (Diptera) and hymenopterans but will also take other invertebrates and some fruits. The species is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Taylor 2015).","In north-west Europe, it is thought that declines may be due to a long sequence of  generally cooler summers, or adverse factors such as biocide-induced reductions or contamination of insect populations, removal of old trees and general habitat deterioration (Taylor 2015).","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number 14,900,000-22,700,000 pairs, which equates to 29,700,000-45,500,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

For these reasons it is evaluated as Vulnerable.,"Behaviour This species is migratory and disperses after breeding from coastal areas to the open ocean (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It returns to its breeding grounds from January, where it breeds from mid-May to mid-June in huge single- or mixed-species colonies that often exceed 100,000 pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding may occur later after periods of cold weather and many individuals do not remain on the breeding grounds during such conditions (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species begins to disperse from the breeding colonies between July and August, often moulting in large flocks of several thousand individuals on beaches between the breeding grounds and the open sea (Olsen and Larsson 2003). Non-breeders may also remain at sea during the breeding season (Snow and Perrins 1998). Outside of the breeding season, the species often occurs singly or in pairs, but may also occur in small flocks or as dispersed aggregations (Flint et al. 1984, Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding It nests on high, steep coastal cliffs with narrow ledges in areas with easy access to freshwater (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding The species moults on sandy beaches (del Hoyo et al. 1996). On passage, it may concentrate at sea on continental shelves, areas of upwelling and at rich fish banks (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Olsen and Larsson 2003). During the winter the species is highly pelagic, usually remaining on the wing out of sight of land (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of marine invertebrates (e.g. squid and shrimps) and fish, although during the breeding season it may also take intertidal molluscs, crustaceans (e.g. crayfish), earthworms, small mammals and plant matter (e.g. aquatic plants, potato tubers and grain) (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996). At sea during the winter, it will also take planktonic invertebrates and often exploits sewage outfalls and fishing vessels (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a compacted mass of mud, grass and feathers, usually built on a narrow ledge on high, steep coastal cliffs (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Occasionally the species may also nest on glaciers or snow banks (where these have covered traditional cliff nesting sites), on buildings and piers, or on flat, rocky or sandy sites up to 20 km inland (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It breeds in very large colonies with neighbouring nests spaced evenly 30-60 cm apart (where site availability allows) (Snow and Perrins 1998), and generally feeds within 50 km of the breeding colony (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","Trophic shifts in the Atlantic appear to have removed the prey base for a large proportion of the population over a relatively short timeframe, and these appear largely to be due to climate change. Both large spills and ongoing chronic oil pollution are impacting populations of this species (Nikolaeva et al. 2006), and may be contributing to reduced prey abundance and poor adult condition resulting in lowered reproductive output. Certain fisheries may also have contributed to depleted food resources for the species (Frederiksen et al. 2004, Nikolaeva et al. 2006), exacerbating population declines due to increased foraging effort and nutritional stress leading to greater adult mortality or breeding desertion (Paredes et al. 2014). Black-legged Kittiwakes also suffer a level of bycatch in longline fisheries, especially the Spanish Gran Sol longline fishery (BirdLife International 2015), for which there is virtually no monitoring of bycatch and none of the vessels operating in the fishery are currently MSC-certified (E. Dunn in litt. 2018). However, there is virtually no bycatch of kittiwakes in the northern Atlantic, with the species noted to be adept at removing prey without capture at least where the hooks are large (Løkkeborg 1990, Dunn and Steel 2001, E. Dunn in litt. 2018). Avian flu has been recorded in the species, but to date only in very few individuals and without any indication of impacts at the population level (Melville and Shortridge 2006). There is a possibility that a future outbreak could lead to significant mortality within a breeding colony.","The global population is estimated to number c. 14,600,000-15,700,000 (Wetlands International 2016).

Nests are formed on narrow cliff edges and sometimes in caves (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","Climatic fluctuations can have devastating impacts on the species's breeding success. Breeding efforts were essentially zero in 1978, 1983, 1990 and 1992, likely caused by reduced prey availability associated with El Niño-events. Pelagic Cormorants are one of the first species to leave young exposed and/or abandon nesting attempts entirely. Therefore, climate-induced changes in food resources may increase adult mortality and result in behavioural changes which increase the risk of nest predation (Sydeman et al. 2001).Camera monitoring of a sub-colony in California (Año Nuevo Island) revealed high frequency of raven Corvus corax visits, interaction with all nests and removal of (at least) 3.3 eggs per nest over a period of 101 days. Carle et al. (2017) attributed the low breeding success to egg depredation by ravens. A single pair of breeding ravens was deemed responsible, and there were large mismatches in hatching success between adjacent colonies. Depredation by ravens resulting in near-total reproductive failure has only been observed as a local phenomenon, and as noted above may be in part mediated through poor adult condition.","There is no global population estimate.

On Henderson Island, has been recorded nesting in woodland behind beaches or in low fern scrub close to the island’s cliffs. Nesting is seasonal, with egg-laying between late May and early July. 50-day incubation period is completed in three stints. The male takes the first stint, averaging 19.3 days, following a similar stint by the female, and then the male for the second time. Egg-hatching normally occurs towards the end of the male’s second stint (Brooke 2010). Off-duty incubating birds can travel over 4,800 km from Henderson towards the coast of Peru (Clay et al. 2017). Breeding sites are completely abandoned during the non-breeding period, after November. They feed mainly at sea on cephalopods, fish and small crustaceans (Imber et al. 1995).","Pacific rats (Rattus exulans) depredate eggs and chicks at peripheral populations, but this may not impact the global population size (S.

It feeds primarily on small fish, especially flying fish, but will also take squid. Most prey is caught by plunge-diving but flying-fish are sometimes taken in flight. Breeding is seasonal in places but can be more or less continuous in others. It is loosely colonial, nesting in rocky crevices, or on the ground on small, remote oceanic islands preferentially on cliffs where take-off is easy. No regular migration is known, although individuals can undergo extensive dispersal out to sea (del Hoyo et al. 1992). On St Helena (South Atlantic), birds tracked with GPS during incubation and chick rearing undertook trips of 1000 - 2000 km, reaching as far as 400 - 750 km from their breeding colony, respectively (S. Oppel in litt).","The Red-billed Tropicbird population in Abrolhos National Park (Brazil) is under threat from high rates of predation on eggs and nestlings by invasive House Rats Rattus rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus (Sarmento et al. 2014). They are highly vulnerable to rat predation due to laying only one egg, their long incubation period, and the ease with which rodents can access the burrows and crevices in which they nest (Sarmento et al. 2014). This threat is of such a magnitude that this sub-population has a mean probability of extinction of 57.5% and a mean time to extinction of 75 years (Sarmento et al. 2014). On Saba island in the Caribbean, breeding success was zero at colonies most vulnerable to predation by cats, as compared with 65% in a colony with lower predation rates (Boeken 2016). However, predation only affects a minority of the global population. Red-billed Tropicbirds have also been impacted by road construction and housing development (Lee and Walsh-McGehe 2000), with the construction of coastal housing and sea walls excluding Tropicbirds from previous nesting sites (Lee and Walsh-McGehe 2000).","The largest colonies with several thousand pairs are found on the Galápagos Islands (Ecuador) and in the Caribbean (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Orta et al. 2019), followed by approximately 1,000 pairs along the Pacific coast of Mexico (Hernández-Vázquez et al. 2018, Piña-Ortiz et al. 2018).

It returns to the breeding grounds from late-May to early-June when the Arctic tundra is still snow-covered, and breeds in colonies of 6 to 15 or occasionally up to 60 pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species may also nest solitarily or as single pairs amidst colonies of Arctic Tern Sterna paradisaea (del Hoyo et al. 1996). After breeding, the adults and juveniles depart the breeding grounds from late-July to August, migrating in flocks of up to a hundred individuals and spending the winter in small flocks or as solitary individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Olsen and Larsson 2003). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on coastal tundra wetlands in the Arctic, showing a preference for swampy, moss and sedge tundra with many lakes, floodlands and low-lying shallow brackish pools, especially where these contain islets or narrow peninsulas of grass or moss and have low, moist margins that provide feeding areas (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species is pelagic, occurring in cold water upwelling zones south of the Equator (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet Breeding When breeding, its diet consists of adult and larval insects (e.g. springtails Collembola), arachnids, small fish and carrion, as well as small birds and the eggs of Arctic Tern Sterna paradisaea and conspecifics (Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species also takes seeds and plant matter on its arrival to the breeding grounds before the Arctic ice melts and other prey items become available (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species takes marine invertebrates and small fish (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow scrape or more substantial cup of grass, moss, seaweed and feathers placed on rocky, barren or damp ground vegetated with moss or grass, usually near the edge of water (Flint et al. 1984, Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996).","No specific information on threats to this species has been recorded within Europe, however as an Arctic breeding species, it is likely to be vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including habitat change and ecosystem shifts (Ganter and Gaston 2013).

Habitat The species shows a preference for forested water margins such as mangrove-lined shores and estuaries, or dense woody vegetation fringing ponds, rivers, lakes and streams (Hancock and Kushlan 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Other suitable habitats include river swamps, canals, artificial ponds, salt-flats, mudflats, tidal zones, exposed coral reefs, reedbeds, grassy marshland, pastures, rice-fields and other flooded cultivation (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Diet Its diet varies considerably over its range, but usually consists predominantly of fish as well as amphibians (e.g. frogs), insects (e.g. water beetles, grasshoppers and dragonflies), spiders, leeches, crustaceans (e.g. crabs and prawns), molluscs, earthworms, polychaete worms, birds, small reptiles and mice (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Breeding site The nest is a small, shallow structure of twigs placed well hidden amongst the branches of trees or bushes (especially mangroves Rhizophora spp. and Avicennia spp., or Allocasuarina spp., Myoporum spp., Callistemon spp., Hibiscus spp., Casuarina spp., Syzygium spp. and Inga spp.) 0.3-10 m above the surface of water or above the ground (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).","The species is threatened by human disturbance, pesticides and habitat destruction, e.g. the loss of mangroves (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005).

Invasive herbivores pose a threat through denudation of vegetation, with goats likely responsible for its extirpation on Malden Island (Gochfeld et al. 2018). The denudation of Phillip Island by goats, before they died out in the early 1900s, and subsequent prevention of regrowth by rabbits, before their eradication in 1988, is likely to have contributed to their historical decline on this island (Priddel et al. 2010).

Most prey is caught by plunge-diving, but flying-fish can be taken on the wing. Breeding occurs seasonally in places, but can also occur aseasonally. The species is loosely colonial, nesting in rocky crevices or a sheltered scrape on the ground on small-remote islands. Nests are placed preferably in inaccessible spots on cliffs where take-off is easy. It is resident and dispersive, with both adults and juveniles wandering extensively (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","Hurricanes Dean and Felix, in 1989 and 1995 respectively, caused high levels of mortality of both chicks and brooding adults in Bermuda (Lee and Walsh-McGehee 2000). This also resulted in the elimination of 30-50% of nesting sites along the south shore of Bermuda, as well as making other sites temporarily unusable (Lee and Walsh-McGehee 2000). This loss of nesting sites is considered to be the most significant long-lasting effect of the hurricanes (Lee and Walsh-McGehee 2000), although artificial nesting sites, known as ‘Longtail Igloos’, have been successfully installed in many areas of the Bermuda coast. Birds nesting in these artificial nests had greater breeding success than those in natural nests in the 2009 and 2011 breeding seasons (Madeiros 2011).Tropicbirds are vulnerable to oil pollution at sea, with 1 in 4 birds showing oil fouling on arrival to Bermuda in the early 1970s (Wingate 1973 in Butler et al. 1973). Oiled birds failed to breed and disappeared from their nesting sites (Wingate pers. comm.). This threat is decreasing; oil pollution peaked in the Sargasso Sea around 1972 and began to decline as a result of new regulations concerning dumping oil at sea (Lee and Walsh-McGehee 2000). Road construction and housing development have impacted tropicbird populations (Lee and Walsh-McGehee 2000). The construction of sea walls, filling in coastal property, and the carving out of cliffs for development have taken their toll on tropicbird populations. Tropicbirds have mostly been reduced to nesting on inaccessible sea cliffs and remote islands and cays (Lee and Walsh-McGehee 2000).

Its diet is comprised mainly of planktonic crustaceans, specifically euphausiids and amphipods, early and calanoid copepods during chick-rearing, and it is supplemented with varying amounts of other invertebrates and small fish. Food is usually obtained at considerable distance from colonies. Spring arrival and the start of laying is variable depending on latitude, starting earliest in the south of its range and latest in the extreme north. It is monogamous with high site fidelity and presumably high mate fidelity between years. Colonies are loose and range from small to large, breeding on offshore islands using dark crevices and cavities in steep sea cliffs, rocky talus slopes and beach boulder fields as nesting sites (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","Climate related trophic shifts appear to have led to considerable declines in the numbers of Parakeet Auklet in Prince William Sound (Agler et al. 1999), although whether populations are affected more widely in Alaska is unknown. Modern populations are considered likely to be much lower than in the 19th century as a result of harvesting and the introduction of invasive predators to many islands for fur production (Nettleship et al. 2018). Additionally, large numbers were previously killed in the particularly destructive high seas salmon drift-net fishery (DeGange and Day 1991), which was closed in the 1990s following improved regulation. Numbers affected today are much smaller with an estimate across all gear types of 36 auklets caught annually between 2007 and 2015 (Eich et al. 2016), and this level of mortality is unlikely to impact populations. Similarly, a total of only 31 oiled individuals were recovered after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, with the climate driven trophic shift more likely to have impacted the population (Agler et al. 1999).Subsistence hunting takes place at Pribilof, St. Lawrence and Little Diomede Island, but mortality levels have not been quantified. Out of 24 studied seabirds in the North Pacific, this species ranked highest in mean number of plastic particles per bird (Robards et al. 1995). The impacts of plastic ingestion are unknown, but birds collected at Buldir showed no relationship between number of plastic pellets in crop and body condition, chicks were not fed plastic by parents (Bond et al. 2010) and no population impact has been demonstrated.Some colonies are suspected of being affected by non-native predators with Arctic Vulpes lagopus and Red Foxes V. vulpes introduced on the Aleutian Islands for fur farming (Bailey 1993) and the accidental introduction of Rats Rattus rattus to many Alaskan islands. However the species continues to breed on islands where Arctic Foxes are native (Pribilof, St. Matthew and St. Lawrence) and the scattered nature of this species's colonies reduces the likelihood that a small number of predators could severely impact a colony.",The global population is estimated to number 1.4 million mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).,Decreasing,"The Parakeet Auklet is found in the North Pacific Ocean, from Hokkaido, Japan and far off the coast of California (U.S.A.) in the south, up to and including the southern part of the Chukchi Sea.

Birds arrive at colonies in the spring, earliest towards the extreme south and latest in the north. It is monogamous with shared mate choice and relatively low mate fidelity between years. Colonies of more than one million individuals may form on remote islands and along the coasts. Nesting takes place on talus slopes, beach boulder rubble, sea cliffs and lava fields, where crevices are suitable for breeding (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","Invasive species and future climate change pose potential threats to the species. In 2007, on Sirius Point, Kiska Island, Brown Rat Rattus norvegicus abundance was qualitatively the lowest, and Least Auklet productivity the highest on record since 2001, suggesting that rats are limiting auklet breeding success (Bond and Jones 2007). There appears to be a critical threshold of rat abundance, above which reproductive failure ensues, and below which auklets are able to buffer the effects of rats on reproductive success. The Sirius Point colony suffered complete reproductive failure in 2001 and 2002, which were also the years with the highest recorded rat abundance. On St. Paul and St. George Island, Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes may be the single largest source of auklet mortality (Roby and Brink 1986, Jones 1992).The species is sensitive to the possible effects of climate change, including the timing of ice-retreat and altered prey distribution and abundance. As yet, interannual variation in prey species availability appears to be the most important factor determining productivity of auklets (Sheffield Guy et al. 2009). Dorresteijn et al. (2012) found that the species experienced higher nutritional stress during warm years compared to cold years. The vital influx of prey-bearing water masses and retention time of preferred prey items (oceanic copepods) on the shelf are controlled by physical processes (winter sea ice cover, timing of ice retreat and flow through the Bering Strait) which are predicted to be altered by future climate change, most likely with negative effects on the Least Auklet population (Dorresteijn et al. 2012).",The global population is estimated to number 20 million mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).,Decreasing,The Least Auklet can be found in the northern Pacific Ocean.

Its diet is comprised mainly of a wide diversity of fish, supplemented with a significant proportion of squid, crustaceans and polychaetes. Chick diet is primarily the high fat and calorific sandeels and capelin. It obtains most prey by pursuit-diving. Individuals arive at colonies on rocky cliffs, boulder areas and talus slopes in spring, with the start of breeding being variable depending on locality. It is a colonial species with aggregations of varying sizes (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","Incidental capture used to be a widespread threat throughout the North Pacific, with large numbers being killed in pelagic driftnets between the 1950s and 1980s, and an estimated 49,000 (± 53,000) killed per year in squid driftnet fisheries in the 1980s (DeGange et al. 1993). Bycatch levels decreased markedly as these fisheries closed due to the UN ban on high seas large-scale driftnets, and at present, the number of birds killed is thought to be minimal, with negligible effects on population trends. Significant mortality rates from bycatch may be continuing in Russian waters, where the Japanese fleet has been permitted to operate since the early 1990s (Zydelis et al. 2013). Predation by invasive Rats Rattus spp., Arctic Vulpes lagopus and Red Foxes V. vulpes may pose a threat to species survival and reproductive success, but the impact is considered to be low, affecting only a minority of the population and not driving significant declines. Nesting in less accessible crevices may reduce the predation pressure on this species compared to other seabirds (Bailey and Kaiser 1993).","The global population is estimated to number more than 1,200,000 individuals, which equates to more than 800,000 mature individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996)",Decreasing,"The Horned Puffin can be found in the northern Pacific Ocean, from the coast of Japan and south-west Canada in the south, up to and including the Chukchi Sea in the north.

In the 1980s, an estimated 123,000 birds per annum were caught in the squid driftnet fishery alone (deGange et al. 1993). While the numbers caught may have decreased in more recent years, Tufted Puffin remains one of the most frequently caught birds, and concern over impacts on the species has been raised in both Russia and Japan (BirdLife International 2010).Climate change poses an ongoing and future threat to the species due to high sensitivity to changes in sea surface temperature (SST). Gjerdrum et al. (2003) used reproductive data from 1975-2002 to show that extreme variation in reproductive performance was related to changes in SST, via changes in prey fish abundance and distribution being linked to decreased growth rates and fledging success. When SST exceeded 9.9 °C, fledging success was virtually zero. With further warming, the largest colony in Canada (Triangle Island colony) could be rendered unsuitable as a breeding site. A lack of suitable islands for Tufted Puffins to colonise and restrictions on current range, is thought to be threatening populations in several areas, including Washington (Gjerdrum et al. 2003). However, Morrison et al. (2011) found no effect of extreme climatic events (1997-98, 2005-06) on adult survival rates on Triangle Island. Hence the severity of impact of climatic changes remains uncertain.Predation by introduced species has had severe impacts in certain parts of the species’ range. Rats Rattus spp. depredate eggs and chicks and were likely responsible for the decline and redistribution of populations on Langara, St. James and Queen Charlotte Islands (Piatt and Kitaysky 2002). Tufted Puffins were not present on the so-called 'Rat Island' (Hawadax) in 2008, but following rat eradication, the puffins recolonised the island and bred successfully in 2013 (Secretariat 2017). Red Vulpes vulpes and Arctic Fox V. lagopus are present on the Commander Islands, Alaska and were likely responsible for the drastic reductions in population size through preying on both chicks and adult birds (Piatt and Kitaysky 2002). On Shaiak, only two adult Red Foxes were recorded, suggesting that the predation pressure can be very high despite low numbers of predators. Tufted Puffins are not found on islands with significant numbers of foxes, but are normally able to recolonise after fox eradication (Bailey 1993).The species is also at risk from oil spills. The Exxon Valdez spill (1989) is thought to have caused the mortality of 13,000 individuals (through starvation), and the Tenyo Maru oil spill (1991) may have claimed as much as 9% of the Washington population. Frequent oil spills have been implicated as playing a significant role in the historic population declines in California (Piatt and Kitaysky 2002).Tufted Puffins are sensitive to disturbance during breeding, and human intrusions associated with research and recreational activities may pose a considerable threat (Pierce and Simmons 1986, Whidden et al. 2007). Fledging success has been found to be significantly lower in heavily disturbed areas than in undisturbed ones (18% as compared to 94%), with e.g. frequent visitation and egg handling leading to lengthened incubation period, resulting in lighter chicks with shorter wings (Pierce and Simons 1986), and occasional desertion of nests (Amaral 1977, Wehle 1980, Pierce and Simons 1986). Fitting of transmitters have also been associated with negative effects on breeding success (Whidden et al. 2007).","The global population is estimated to number more than 3.5 million individuals, equating to more than 2.3 million mature individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996).",Stable,"","",Terrestrial|Marine,"",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It arrives on its breeding grounds in late-May, where it breeds from early-June in loose colonies of 2-10 pairs (rarely up to 18 pairs) often with other species (e.g. Arctic Tern Sterna paradisaea) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The departure from the breeding grounds occurs from late-July onwards, with the species migrating in small flocks of 2-16 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It forages solitarily or in small loose flocks (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding The species breeds in the upper boreal forest (taiga) and tundra zones of the high Arctic, showing a preference for nesting on small, low islets in shallow pools (created by snow-melt on tundra underlain with permafrost) surrounded by stands of stunted alder Alnus spp. and willow Salix spp. and by muddy, boggy or marshy ground with sedges and moss (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Olsen and Larsson 2003). The species also breeds on marshy tundra in high Arctic river deltas and on marshy ground in well-wooded river valleys (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season, the species forages pelagically on the open sea or along the edges of pack-ice (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Breeding On its breeding grounds, the species is chiefly insectivorous, its diet including Coleoptera and dipteran flies (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding On migration and in the winter, its diet consists of small fish and surface-dwelling marine invertebrates (including plankton, crustaceans, molluscs and priapulid marine worms) (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding site The nest is constructed of dry grass, sedge and moss, usually on a tussock on an island in a pool in the tundra or forest (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species nests in near invisible colonies, often with other species, with an average distance between neighbouring nests of 43 m (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","The species is strongly associated with areas of sea ice, especially in the post-breeding period (Gilg et al. 2016), and the alteration in ice distribution and indeed ongoing loss of ice may have already caused a shift in a least a portion of the species's annual movements (Joiris 2017). More research is urgently required, particularly as breeding success appears to be very low (typically less than 33%) (Burger et al. 2018). The species also faces a number of more direct human threats, such as nest failures as a result of human disturbance in Canada (Burger et al. 2018) and being shot by native Alaskan peoples for food (Burger et al. 2018).

Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season, the species is highly pelagic, but generally avoids cold current areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of fish up to 18 cm long (usually 6-8 cm) and squid, but it also occasionally takes crustaceans, insects and offal (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species is reliant upon prey driven to the surface by predatory fish (e.g. tuna, Scombidae), especially when breeding (Higgins and Davies 1996). Breeding site The nest is a slight depression or scrape on the ground (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). It shows a preference for nesting on flat, bare sand, coral grit or shell amongst low vegetation on beaches above the high-water mark or on coral islands, atolls and sandbanks (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Higgins and Davies 1996). Less often, it may nest on rock stacks or other offshore islets, and on ledges or terraces of cliffs (although it avoids sheer cliff-faces) (Higgins and Davies 1996). It nests in dense colonies, within which neighbouring nests may be placed c.50 cm apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Higher nesting densities occur in areas where bare ground predominates but which are vegetated with plants greater than or equal to 15 cm tall (Feare et al. 1997).","Some colonies (e.g. Ascension Island) (del Hoyo et al. 1996) are threatened by predation from introduced rats Rattus spp. and domestic cats Felis catus (Rodriguez et al. 2006), and the species has been displaced from nesting colonies on Bird Island by invasive ants Anoplolepis longipes (Feare 1999). Colonies have declined in line with observed increases in sea temperatures in Australia, in contrast to the fortunes of Bridled Tern, which have formed new colonies further south (Dunlop and Surman 2012). Variations in sea-surface temperature have been shown to negatively influence the species's foraging success at breeding colonies, hence lowering reproductive success (Erwin and Congdon 2007). Previously, persistent large scale egg-collecting in some areas has encouraged the species to move to suboptimal nesting sites, resulting in higher mortality and reduced reproductive success (van Halewyn and Norton 1984).","The global population is estimated to number c.35 million individuals (Wetlands International 2020), which roughly equates to 23 million mature individuals.",Unknown,Sooty Tern breeds on tropical islands and ranges through most of the tropical oceans (del Hoyo et al. 1996).,"",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe mortality of the species was significantly reduced on Isla Isabel (a densely forested tropical island off the Pacific coast of Mexico) by the eradication of introduced domestic cats Felis catus using a combination of poisoning, trapping and hunting with firearms (Rodriguez et al. 2006).

It has been seen fishing in the company of dolphins and Peruvian Boobies. Breeding is seasonal in places and otherwise opportunistic, nesting on cliffs and islets in areas with little or no vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","The Galápagos subspecies of Blue-footed Booby, Sula nebouxii excisa, appears to be suffering from a food shortage related to a reduction in the population of clupeid fish. This has induced chronic lack of breeding in the Galápagos Islands, with all monitored colonies containing fewer than 15% of the historical maximum number of nests (Anchundia et al. 2014). Further to this, the majority of clutches observed failed without producing a nestling (Anchundia et al. 2014). It is thought that this failure to breed began in the El Niño Southern Oscillation event in 1997/98. The periodic disappearance of clupeid fish from the waters around the Galápagos is connected with the Southern Decadal Oscillation in the Pacific Ocean, but the El Niño event of 1997/98 appeared to spark the present period of chronic low abundance, which appears to be causing adult Blue-footed Boobies to continually defer breeding (Anchundia et al. 2014).

Observational data suggests that it has not met the threshold for listing as threatened during the last decade, even though the rate of decline might accelerate again in the future. Consequently, the species is listed as Near Threatened.","The species breeds in mature deciduous forest (AOU 1983, Sibley and Monroe 1990), in both upper dry slopes and ridge tops and riparian bottomlands (Buehler et al. 2013). In general, individuals preferably establish territories in forests with higher canopy height, greater canopy cover (c.85%) and larger trees (Roth and Islam 2008). Recent evidence suggests that the species selects habitat in the vicinity of small canopy gaps, both natural and anthropogenic (Wood et al. 2005, 2006, Bakermans and Rodewald 2009, Boves et al. 2013), within these larger forested landscapes. The nest is built on the branch of a tree, and breeding takes place between May and July (Curson et al. 1994). Wintering birds are found in Andean submontane forest, mainly between 1,000 and 2,000 m (Curson et al. 1994, Buehler et al. 2013), although they have been observed at higher elevations (e.g., 3500 m in Venezuela; Rengifo et al. 2005). Traditional shade-coffee plantations are an important wintering habitat; they support densities of Cerulean Warblers 3-14 times higher than in neighbouring primary forest (Bakermans et al. 2009). Information on migratory stopover sites is limited, but the species has been recorded in primary and secondary subtropical montane forests in Belize (600-750 m; Parker 1994), at a wide range of elevations and habitats in Honduras (Welton et al. 2012) and a range of forested habitats in Costa Rica (Stiles and Skutch 1989). ","Degradation of habitat through land use change is the major threat to this species. Conversion of mature deciduous forest to agricultural or urban areas, fragmentation and increasing isolation of remaining mature deciduous forest, the change to shorter rotation periods and even-aged management, and loss of key tree species to disease are the main constraints to the species on the breeding grounds (Hamel 2000, Buehler et al. 2013). Mountaintop mining constitutes a known, but as yet uncontrolled, threat on the breeding grounds, primarily in West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee and Kentucky (G. Butcher in litt. 2003). On the wintering grounds, habitat is threatened by the conversion to other land uses such as pastureland, subsistence crops, conventional coffee plantations and coca plantations, which have a detrimental effect on the availability of suitable primary forest habitat. Conversion from shade-grown to sun-grown coffee reduces habitat quality for the species; Colombia has converted 70% of its plantations, while Venezuela lost 38% of its plantations between 1950 and 1990 (Bakermans et al. 2009). Attempts to eradicate coca plantations may also potentially damage forests (Hamel 2000, Buehler et al. 2013). ","The global population is estimated to number 530,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2020).",Decreasing,"The species breeds from Quebec and Ontario (Canada) west to Nebraska and south to northern Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia (U.S.A.) (AOU 1983). Within this broad range, its distribution is very patchy. Although sizeable populations can be found throughout the breeding range (Buehler et al. 2008), approximately 80% of the population breeds in the Appalachian Mountains (Wood et al. 2013). The species migrates south through the south-eastern USA, the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica, the Caribbean slope of Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica and Panama, and winters from Colombia and Venezuela south, mainly east of the Andes, to eastern Ecuador, south-eastern Peru and perhaps occasionally to northern Bolivia (AOU 1983, Herzog et al. 2009).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIn the United States, Cerulean Warblers are considered a National Species of Conservation Concern. In Canada, Cerulean Warblers are listed as Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada, and as Special Concern on Schedule 1 of the federal Species at Risk Act. In North America, current conservation activities include planning projects for habitat acquisition and protection, land protection and acquisition projects to increase the amount of forest in certain areas such as the Interior Low Plateaus and Coastal Plain of Tennessee. Forest management guidelines for the Appalachian Mountain region (based on a large-scale silvicultural experiment; Boves et al. 2013) have been recently published that should prove useful throughout the breeding range. Over one million acres of bottomland forest in the USA have been replanted with native hardwoods. ProAves Colombia established the Cerulean Warbler Bird Reserve, the first reserve in South America specifically for a neotropical migrant landbird. A conservation corridor has also been created in Colombia through reforestation to connect existing habitat. Shade-grown coffee is promoted as “bird friendly” (Jones et al. 2002, Bakermans et al. 2009, Colorado et al. 2012).Conservation Actions Proposed Investigate long-term population viability in response to forest management (J. Jones in litt. 2016). Protect intact primary forest ecosystems to maintain wintering populations. Urgently protect key sites for the species in its breeding range. Prevent the conversion of shade-coffee agroecosystems (which support high densities of wintering Cerulean warblers) into cattle lands (C. Rengifo in litt. 2012). Conduct thorough environmental impact assessment prior to any mining operations to ensure that measures are taken to avoid destroying habitat and to mitigate against any negative impacts.

As a result of intensive conservation action however, the species is now recovering at least in parts of its range. If conservation action was to stop, the population increase could quickly revert so that the species could qualify for a threatened status within a short time. Consequently it is listed as Near Threatened.","Although once abundant in native prairie intermixed with oak Quercus spp. woodland, as prairie and woodland habitats were converted to cropland it had to adapt to agricultural habitats (Schroeder and Robb 1993; del Hoyo et al. 1994). Areas of native vegetation are still required for roosting and breeding, and for displaying males which will select lek sites with short grass, usually on elevated ground (Hovick et al. 2015). Most nest sites are in open, grassy habitats such as ungrazed meadows or hayfields (del Hoyo et al. 1994).",Loss of prairie habitat through conversion to cropland was primarily responsible for the extinction of T. c. cupido and declines in the other two subspecies. Grazing pressure from sheep and the increase in cropland throughout areas of native prairie is threatening the remaining population of T. c. attwateri in Texas. Habitat fragmentation leading to isolated populations and a loss of genetic variance and subsequent decreases in fertility will reduce fitness and reinforce negative demographic trends (Westemeier et al. 1998). In certain states hunting continues (Schroeder and Robb 1993). The species may suffer from competition with Ring-necked Pheasant Phasianus colchicus (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Noise from roads and wind turbines were found to negatively affect the propagation distance of boom calls at leks (Raynor et al. 2017).,"The global population is estimated to number 360,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).",Increasing,"Tympanuchus cupido is restricted to prairie intermixed with cropland, primarily in the mid-western states of the USA. The three recognised subspecies vary in status: the Heath Hen T. c. cupido is extinct, and the Attwater's Prairie Hen T. c. attwateri is restricted to small portions of south-east Texas (numbering under 1,000 in the mid-1990s [del Hoyo et al. 1994]) (Schroeder and Robb 1993) and under 70 individuals in the 2010's [M. Morrow per Johnson et al. 2020). The Greater Prairie-chicken (T. c. pinnatus) is extinct or in danger of extinction in 15 states, but numerous enough to be legally hunted in four states (Schroeder and Robb 1993), with the largest remaining populations in Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota (del Hoyo et al. 1994). In recent years the species has extended its non-breeding range northward into Canada (D. Svedarsky in litt. 2019)","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayMost management effort has been directed toward improvement of habitat. Effective strategies have included manipulation of grazing pressure, control of burning and establishment of reserves. Removal of encroaching eastern red-cedar (Juniperus virginiana) trees has been identified as an essential activity for population survival (McNew et al. 2012; Raynor et al. 2019). Population reintroduction may be necessary to expand its distribution, particularly where there are no dispersal corridors between occupied and unoccupied habitats (Roy and Gregory 2019), but so far it has had mixed success (Schroeder and Robb 1993; Roy and Gregory 2019). Hunting legislation has frequently been used to protect populations, with mixed success - both T. c. cupido and attwateri were protected. Legislation has been more effective with T. c. pinnatus, perhaps because of its large and diverse distribution (Schroeder and Robb 1993). Lek density was found to be substantially higher in grasslands and wetlands enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program scheme (Adkins et al. 2019). Translocations led to a significant increase in mtDNA diversity (Bateson et al. 2014), while population reinforcement lowered the site-specific extinction probabilities (Hardy et al. 2017). Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor population trends. Monitor rates of habitat loss and degradation within the species's range. In remaining tallgrass prairie, infrequent burning and grazing (i.e., patch-burn grazing) shows promise for enhancing survival by providing habitat at nesting, brooding and wintering life stages (Winder et al. 2017; Londe et al. 2019). Strictly control hunting, and if survival is confirmed to be higher in unhunted populations, consider banning hunting of the species. Retain/restore corridors of suitable habitat between populations to facilitate dispersal and reduce the stresses associated with a loss of genetic variation. Removal of Ring-necked Pheasants Phasianus colchicus may reduce interspecific competition (del Hoyo et al. 1994).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

It arrives on its breeding grounds between late-April and May and breeds from late-May onwards (Madge and Burn 1988) in highly dispersed (Kear 2005) solitary pairs (del Hoyo et al. 1992). After mating (from June onwards), males migrate long distances prior to their flightless moult, most travelling in small groups to inshore or offshore coastal waters (Madge and Burn 1988). Females and juveniles leave the breeding grounds in September (Madge and Burn 1988). The species is highly gregarious when not breeding (Madge and Burn 1988) with males forming large congregations during the flightless moulting period (Kear 2005). Large flocks of several hundred to a thousand (Snow and Perrins 1998) or occasionally over 100,000 individuals can be observed during winter (Scott and Rose 1996). Non-breeders often oversummer on the wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988). Habitat Breeding The species breeds on Arctic dwarf heath (Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005) or boggy tundra on pools, small lakes, streams (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and slow-flowing rivers (Snow and Perrins 1998). It shows a preference for freshwater habitats (del Hoyo et al. 1992) with low banks (Flint et al. 1984), small islets (Kear 2005) and high abundances of aquatic invertebrate and plant life positioned in swampy valleys or among mossy bogs (Flint et al. 1984), especially where suitable shrubs (e.g. willow or birch) and herbaceous vegetation are available for nesting cover (Johnsgard 1978, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). It generally avoids areas with steep slopes or wetlands enclosed by forest (Kear 2005). Non-breeding Although the species may use freshwater lakes on migration (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) the majority moult and overwinter at sea (Kear 2005) or shallow inshore waters less than 20 m deep (Kear 2005) (optimally 5-15 m [Scott and Rose 1996]) with abundant benthic fauna (Kear 2005), generally between 500 m and c.2 km from the shore (Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of molluscs, especially during the winter (del Hoyo et al. 1992), although it occasionally takes other aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans (del Hoyo et al. 1992) (e.g. barnacles and shrimps [Johnsgard 1978]), worms (del Hoyo et al. 1992), echinoderms, isopods, amphidods (Kear 2005) and insects (e.g. midges and caddisflies [del Hoyo et al. 1992]) as well as small fish (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and fish eggs (Snow and Perrins 1998). On the breeding grounds the species may also consume plant matter (del Hoyo et al. 1992) such as seeds, roots and tubers (del Hoyo et al. 1992) and the vegetative parts of aquatic plants (Flint et al. 1984). Breeding site The nest is a scrape on the ground hidden amongst vegetation (del Hoyo et al. 1992) close to water (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005) or placed further away in dwarf heath (Kear 2005).","Through a variety of effects, climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Decreasing spring snow cover duration in North American boreal regions have been linked to population declines of Scoters, likely due to trophic mismatch (Drever et al. 2011), and future ocean acidification may lead to sustained declines in molluscs which form a large part of their diet (Steinacher et al. 2009, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). The commercial exploitation of benthic shellfish poses an additional threat through competition for food resources (Kear 2005). Oil spills and chronic oil pollution threaten the species in the winter moulting period where large and highly vulnerable concentrations of the population occur, while oil drilling sites could also cause low-level impacts through human disturbance and degradation of food resources (Gorski et al. 1977, Nikolaeva et al. 2006). In parts of the range, avoidance of busy shipping areas by flocks of the species could displace flocks from preferred feeding areas. Hunting represents another threat to the species, with an average of 9,500 birds reported to be shot annually in the US and an additional 7,000 per year in Canada through the 1980s and 1990s. However, the actual number killed may have been much higher with maximum estimates exceeding 24,000 in the US in 1974 and 23,000 annually in Canada between 1974 and 1982 (Bordage and Savard 2011). Since this period, numbers of hunters have decreased considerably and the annual harvest has fallen concomitantly. The species is susceptible to avian influenza and may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006), however the disease is unlikely to affect the majority of the population at once and only small numbers of birds tested in various countries have developed the disease despite evident exposure to the virus. High-speed ferries can cause disturbance to this species (Larsen and Laubek 2005). In some areas, the breeding habitat is threatened by eutrophication from agricultural nutrient loads (Kear 2005).","The total population is estimated to number c.530,000-830,000 individuals (Delany and Scott 2006), probably including c.350,000-560,000 mature individuals, on the basis that they account for around 2/3 of the population.

Populations decreased sharply in Puerto Rico between 2008-2014 as as legal hunting increased and such declines are suspected to be amplified by an increase in illegal hunting from 2015 onwards (Rivera-Milán et al. 2016). Collision with man-made objects is a major source of mortality in Florida, and pesticide use and human impact may also have detrimental effects (Bancroft and Bowman 2001).","The global population of the White-crowned Pigeon is currently estimated at 550,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).",Decreasing,"Patagioenas leucocephala is found primarily in the Bahamas, Cuba, Jamaica and Antigua.

It prefers montane areas where it occupies evergreen forests, forest edges or secondary forest, but also a variety of open habitats. It nests on ledges or shallow caves in steep rock faces and canyons, often in proximity to waterfalls or in sea caves (Lowther and Collins 2002, Levad 2010). It occurs mainly at 1,000-3,000 m, but is occasionally seen from close to sea-level to 3,700 m.","The threats facing this species are currently uncertain. Because of its preference for higher altitudes, it has been suggested that climate change could be a key threat (Rosenberg et al. 2016).

In the non-breeding season it occurs in a variety of habitats, including scrubland, arid thorn forest and mixed pine-oak-juniper forest (Healy and Calder 2006, Powers et al. 2018). It feeds on nectar from several different plant species, as well as on arthropod prey (Powers et al. 2018), and breeding may be timed to coincide with the flowering of food plants (Powers et al. 2018) (recorded from end of March to mid July; Healy and Calder 2006).","In some cases human activity may actually benefit this species. Forest degradation may increase the availability of certain food flowers (see Healy and Calder 2006), and food availability can be artificially increased by the presence of feeders, which can also help increase abundance (Healy and Calder 2006, Powers et al. 2018). However, while the species may tolerate some forest degradation, habitat destruction could impact the species (Rosenberg et al. 2016, Powers et al. 2018); forest loss is currently estimated at ~5% across the stipulated ten year period throughout this species's range (Tracewski et al. 2016).

By the late 1980s, c.85% of the species’s habitat in the 1850s had been lost, with much of the remaining habitat in a degraded state (Ehrlich et al. 1992). Urban development, pollution and introduced predators continue to pose major threats (Taylor and van Perlo 1998, Schwarzbach et al. 2006). Population declines in the nominate form were accelerated (numbers dropped by nearly 50% over a nine-year period) when invasive Spartina vegetation was removed leading to habitat loss (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2013; Lampert et al. 2014; Casazza et al. 2016). Changes in agricultural water supply and management of agriculture water runoff may affect habitat availability at the Salton Sea (C. T. Overton in litt. 2016). Sea level rise poses a significant future threat (Zhang and Gorelick 2014; Rosencranz et al. 2019). A recent novel and severe chigger mite infection is also threatening populations of form yumanensis in southwestern Arizona where upwards of 92% of some sub-populations are infested with the mite; such infestations may result in population declines of this form (Harrity and Conway 2019).","The population of obsoletus in 2009-2011 was estimated at 1,167 individuals (range 954-1,426) using both survey data and model predictions of densities for unsurveyed sites (Liu et al. 2012a,b).

The declines are assumed to continue into the future as an increased frequency of extreme precipitation events and flooding are projected to severely damage and destroy its habitat. At least in parts of the range, there is a high probability that the species may be extirpated by 2068. It is therefore listed as Endangered.","The species inhabits saline, brackish and freshwater marsh habitats. It can be found in wet meadows and savanna, coastal prairies and even impoundment areas like sewage treatment plants (Roach and Barrett 2015, Watts 2016). Coastal habitat may be influenced by tides (USFWS 2018a). An important characteristic of sites occupied by the species is typically tall, dense herbaceous vegetation, which it uses for shelter (USFWS 2018a). It occupies sites with shallower water than other rallids (Roach and Barrett 2015), but particularly juveniles require elevated refugia to retreat to in case of a rise in water level (USFWS 2018a). Particular during the breeding season, the species has strict habitat requirements, as it builds its nests low to the ground in areas of dense vegetation with water depths 1-6 cm (Watts 2016, USFWS 2018a). It feeds on terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates (Roach and Barrett 2015). The species is secretive in behaviour, moving mainly by walking and running through dense vegetation; flights are short and rare (Taylor and van Perlo 1998, USFWS 2018a).","The major threat to the species is the loss of its habitat. Wetlands are degraded due to pollution, wildfires and grazing (Eddleman et al. 1994, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). About 50% of the original wetlands in the U.S.A. have been lost since European settlement in the 19th century (USFWS 2018a), particularly along the west coast where up to 85% of estuarine vegetated tidal wetlands have been lost (Brophy et al. 2019). The most severe causes for concern are changes in the water level, as the species has strict requirements for a specific water depth of &lt; 6 cm for nesting. Within the range of the Black Rail in the U.S.A., wetlands are being drained and ditched as groundwater is abstracted for agricultural expansion and urban development (Eddleman et al. 1994, USFWS 2018a). Climate change is projected to massively impact on the hydrologic regimes of wetlands in various ways: increasing temperatures may lead to a drying up of wetlands, an encroachment of mangrove forests into coastal marshes and to range expansions of non-native species (USFWS 2018a and references therein). On the other hand, an increased frequency of extreme weather events with extreme precipitation, hurricanes and increased flooding and inundation of coastal marsh habitat from rising sea levels can cause massive damage to the habitat, destroy the vegetation cover and cause direct mortality when the water level rises (USFWS 2018a). Modelling future resiliency of the species in the eastern U.S.A. revealed that under different climate change and land management scenarios the species will undergo a steep decline in the future, until a complete extirpation from the area by 2068 (USFWS 2018a).","The global population size of this species has not been quantified directly and a distinct paucity of data renders the calculation of reliable estimates difficult. The subspecies jamaicensis, which occurs in eastern North and Central America as well as in the Caribbean, was estimated in the year 2000 to number 25,000-100,000 individuals, roughly equating to 15,000-70,000 mature individuals (Wetlands International 2020). However, given the dramatic declines witnessed in this subspecies in the years since, it would appear that this figure is a considerable overestimate. Watts (2016) recently provided an accurate estimate for the population of jamaicensis residing on the USA's eastern coast between New England and Florida, 455-1,315 breeding pairs or 910-2,630 mature individuals, however this population does not incorporate those individuals that comprise the Texan, central USA, Caribbean or Brazilian individuals of the same subspecies. No other population estimates are thought to be currently available for jamaicensis. The subspecies coturniculus, which occurs in California and northern Mexico, is estimated at 10,000-25,000 individuals, roughly equating to 7,000-17,000 mature individuals (Wetlands International 2020). There are no estimates available for the subspecies murivagans and salinasi in western South America (Wetlands International 2020). As a result, the global population is tentatively placed in the band 10,000-49,999 mature individuals however, such estimates require confirmation and are liable to change should more accurate estimates be provided.",Decreasing,"Laterallus jamaicensis is widespread, but very local and rare, in fresh and saline marshes, wet meadows and savanna in North, Central and South America and in the Caribbean. The nominate subspecies jamaicensis occurs on the east coast of U.S.A., with sporadic records inland to Colorado and Minnesota (but no confirmed nesting since 1932). It is very local in north-east Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica, Panama (only in 1963), and has recently been recorded in Honduras (R. Gallardo in litt. 2013). The species is possibly breeding in Guatemala, where it may have been overlooked in the past decades (Eisermann and Avendano 2018). It is locally rare in the Dominican Republic and Haiti, but mainly a winter visitor in Jamaica and Cuba. It has probably been extirpated as a breeder from Puerto Rico (to U.S.A.) by introduced mongooses, and is now extremely rare in winter. It is recorded as a non-breeder in the Virgin Islands (to U.S.A.). There are few records from northern Brazil (Lees et al. 2014). The subspecies coturniculus is very local in south-west USA, irregularly to north-west Mexico (one recent record). The race murivagans occurs at few coastal marshes in central Peru.

Occasionally, it is also found in salt-marsh during migration (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","Severe declines have been evident in northern part of range since the 1940s, mainly as result of loss, modification and degradation of wetland habitats, and pesticide use. Populations in southern USA appear more stable. In some parts of the range, up to 90% of the original wetland habitat was lost by the 1980s, and remaining wetlands are subject to altered flooding regimes, a lack of sedimentation and sea-level rise in coastal areas (Pickens and Meanley 2020). Suitable habitats are further degraded by the encroachment of trees and shrubby vegetation, including invasive plants like Common Reed Phragmites australis and Reed Canary-grass Phalaris arundinacea (Pickens and Meanley 2020).Despite being considered a game bird, pressure from hunting appears to be very low (Pickens and Meanley 2020).

It was formerly abundant, but declined rapidly over a century ago as a result of hunting and habitat loss and is now considered likely to be extinct (Elphick et al. 2010, Roberts and Jarić 2016). However, some uncertainty of the species's extinction status remains (Roberts and Jarić 2016, D. Roberts in litt. 2016). A set of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017) laid out methods for quantitatively estimating a species’s probability of extinction based on parameters associated with threats, in addition to records and surveys. Based on the application of these methods (Butchart et al. 2018), this species would qualify for reclassification as Critically Endangered. However, the authors recommended retaining it as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) because the many claimed records since the last confirmed one (1963) all have a very low probability of being valid.","It bred (May-August) in treeless arctic tundra at 180-335 m, comprising grassy meadows with birch (Betula) and sedge (Carex) (Gill et al. 1998). On autumn migration (July-October), it favoured ericaceous heath, crowberries Empetrum nigrum, pastures and intertidal flats (Gill et al. 1998). Winter habitat was possibly wet pampas grasslands, intertidal and semi-desert areas (Gill et al. 1998). On return migration (March-May), it favoured burnt areas in tall grass and mixed-grass prairies, and Rocky Mountain Grasshopper Melanoplus spretus was a key food source (Gill et al. 1998). It was gregarious, with traditional autumn migration sites (Gill et al. 1998).","Large-scale spring hunting in North America partially explains the species's potential extinction, but there was no recovery after hunting was outlawed and abandoned in c.1916 (Gill et al. 1998). The main cause is almost certainly the near total loss of prairies to agriculture, compounded by the suppression of prairie wildfires and the extinction of M. spretus (Gill et al. 1998). The widespread conversion of the pampas began after the main decline, but has hindered any possible recovery (Gill et al. 1998).","Any remaining population is assumed to be tiny (numbering fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals), as there have been no confirmed sightings since the early 1960s.",Unknown,"Numenius borealis bred at (and presumably between) the Bathurst peninsula and Point Lake in Northwest Territories, Canada (Gill et al. 1998), and perhaps also Alaska, USA (Craig 2019). Birds migrated across Hudson Bay to Labrador (and New England, USA), and through the Caribbean to Argentina (especially the Pampas), and possibly Uruguay, Paraguay (R. Clay in litt. 2003), southernmost Brazil and Chile south to Patagonia (Gill et al. 1998). The return migration was probably along the Pacific coast, through Central America, across the Gulf of Mexico to the Texas coast and northwards through the prairies. It probably numbered hundreds of thousands, but declined rapidly in the 1870s-1890s to become very rare in the 20th century (Gill et al. 1998, Graves 2010). The last irrefutable record was of a specimen collected in Barbados in 1963 (Roberts et al. 2010). Since then there have been no confirmed records (none from the wintering grounds in South America since 1939), only several unconfirmed reports during 1981-2006 (Gill et al. 1998, M. Parr in litt. 2003, C. L. Gratto-Trevor in litt. 2004, R. Hoffman in litt. 2006, N. Crockford in litt. 2008), with the latest unconfirmed sighting from Barbados in September 2012 (E. Reed in litt. 2012). The population (if one persists) must be tiny (Gill et al. 1998). Analyses based on historic sightings found that the species's population likely collapsed in in the first decade of the 20th century and most likely went extinct in the late 1960s, with an upper limit to the confidence interval of 1977 (Elphick et al. 2010, Craig 2019). However, a new analysis that incorporated sighting uncertainty (Roberts and Jarić 2016) concluded that the species is possibly extinct but that there is a level of uncertainty that would suggest that the species's extinction is not yet confirmed (D.

Although it has experienced significant past population declines, the rate is currently close to, but does not meet the threshold required to list this species as Vulnerable. Such rates of decline are projected to continue into the future and as such, this species is listed as Near Threatened.","It nests in heavily grazed, shortgrass prairie, xeric scrub and fallow fields, typically on prairie dog Cynomys spp. colonies (Knowles et al. 1982, Knopf 1996, Knopf and Rupert 1999, Duchardt et al. 2020). It arrives in Canada and northern U.S.A. in late March-April and leaves in early October (Knopf 1996, S. Dinsmore in litt. 2020). Recent work has shown that Montana breeders stop over during fall in Colorado/Kansas en route to wintering areas in the southern U.S.A.; movements north in spring are more direct (Pierce et al. 2017). It is a dietary generalist in winter (Knopf 1998) when it inhabits semi-desert, dry, bare agricultural land and (in Mexico) breeding-type habitats (S. D. Earsom and V. B. Estelle in litt. 1999). In the Imperial Valley (California) wintering flocks show a preference for burnt Bermudagrass fields and grazed alfalfa (Wunder and Knopf 2003). The species apparently fares better during drought years (Dinsmore 2008). It flocks in winter and on migration (S. D. Earsom and V. B. Estelle in litt. 1999).","Hunting probably explains the long-term decline. More recently, cultivation and urbanisation have reduced nesting habitat, and intensive grazing has resulted in desertification and a reduced prey base (S. D. Earsom and V. B. Estelle in litt. 1999). Large declines in grazing species, especially bison and prairie dogs, have resulted in unsuitable habitat succession (Piersma 1996, Knopf and Rupert 1999). Prairie dogs, which this species is particularly associated with, can be greatly affected by sylvatic plague (Dinsmore and Smith 2010), yet treatment of these species against this can have further detrimental effects on nesting success of the plover (Dinsmore 2013). Furthermore, within- and between-year dispersal distances are generally short (&lt;5 km), suggesting that local scale conservation of prairie dogs may be important (Skrade and Dinsmore 2010). Over 70% of nests on cultivated land are destroyed by farm machinery (Shackford et al. 1999), although Dreitz and Knopf (2007) suggest that nest success is comparable between cultivated land and grasslands - instead the cause of nest failure is different between the two habitat types. Mining activities within its range can have detrimental effects on this species (Andres and Stone 2010).","Whilst thought to number just 10,000-14,000 mature individuals until relatively recently (2009), estimates have been subject to significant revision and Partners in Flight (2019) now estimate the population to total ~20,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Charadrius montanus breeds in south Alberta and south-west Saskatchewan, Canada, and Montana, Wyoming (3,400 adults), eastern Colorado (8,600 individuals), Park County in Colorado (2,300 adults), New Mexico, the Oklahoma Panhandle (68-91 individuals), U.S.A. (Knopf 1996, Childers and Dinsmore 2008, McConnell et al. 2009), and potentially &gt;100 individuals in Nebraska (S. Dinsmore in litt. 2016). It has bred in Texas, east Utah (Day 1994) and once in eastern Arizona (Knopf and Rupert 1999), and has apparently been extirpated from former breeding areas in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Kansas (McConnell et al. 2009). All these birds winter from Sacramento, San Joaquin and Imperial valleys, California (Knopf and Rupert 1995, S. D. Earsom and V. B. Estelle in litt. 1999), south to Baja California, Mexico (Wilbur 1987), and irregularly in south Arizona and south Texas in the Blackland Prairie (Knopf 1996, M. Lockwood in litt. 1999). There appears to be some mixing on the wintering grounds, with birds banded in Montana having been documented over-wintering in southern California, southeastern Arizona, and Texas (S. Dinsmore, in litt. 2016). Abundant in the 19th century, it declined to an estimated 8,000-9,000 birds in 1995, including a 63% decrease from 1966-1991 (Knopf 1996), but the population is now estimated at 15,000-20,000 individuals (or 18,000-20,000 individuals [Andres et al. 2012]). These figures are likely to reflect an increase in counting accuracy rather than a recent population increase. Breeding was first successful in Nuevo León, Mexico, in 2004 (Gonzales Rojas et al. 2006) following an unsuccessful attempt in 1998 (F. L. Knopf in litt. 1998, 1999, Knopf and Rupert 1999), and in Coahuila in 1999 (Desmond and Ramirez 2002). These and/or northern birds regularly winter at Janos in Chihuahua (P. Manzano in litt. 1998, S. D. Earsom and V. B.

A Conservation Action Plan for this species was published in 2010 (Andres and Stone 2010). Pawnee National Grassland, Colorado, and Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge, Montana, are important reserves (Shackford et al. 1999). It has been proposed for listing under the Federal Endangered Species Act (F. L. Knopf in litt. 1998, 1999). Black-tailed prairie dog Cynomys ludovicianus has also been proposed, partly because it helps to maintain suitable habitat (F. L. Knopf in litt. 1998, 1999, Duchardt et al. 2020). The release of Black-footed Ferret in Mexico is helping with prairie dog colony protection (B. Leachman in litt. 2003).Conservation Actions ProposedSet up a functional Working Group for this species (Andres and Stone 2010). Define Mexican breeding and winter distribution (S. D. Earsom and V. B. Estelle in litt. 1999). Monitor U.S.A. and Canadas populations. Investigate its demography across its range (S. Dinsmore in litt. 2016). Conduct research to investigate how this species may be impacted by energy development projects (Andres and Stone 2010). Improve population estimates by documenting the number of birds nesting away from prairie dog colonies. Research movements of birds (S. D. Earsom and V. B. Estelle in litt. 1999). Protect prairie dog colonies, especially at Janos (S. D. Earsom and V. B. Estelle in litt. 1999, S. Dinsmore in litt. 2016). Restore prairie ecosystems (include protection/reintroduction of grazers). Protect remaining breeding and wintering habitats and prevent further conversion of grasslands. Ensure suitable grassland habitat for breeding mountain plovers by preserving large prairie dogs towns, conducting prescribed burns and implementing heavy grazing when required (Schaffer et al. 2019). Stop agricultural disturbance at nest sites. Train and raise awareness amongst farmers to encourage the protection of this species and its habitat (Andres and Stone 2010). Monitor the extent and health of habitat throughout its range (Childers and Dinsmore 2008). Potentially, future conservation actions for this species may be best targeted at improving chick and adult survival as these factors have been suggested to have a great impact on population growth than nesting success (see Dinsmore et al. 2010).

Nesting populations fluctuate widely in response to climatic events, although these fluctuations are less than one order of magnitude. It is likely to be at high risk from catastrophic events or local anthropogenic changes, and should be carefully monitored.","This coastal species breeds very synchronously and often at high densities (up to 110 nests/100m2) on remote rocky coasts and islets (Velarde 1992, 1999). It feeds largely within inshore waters and in the littoral zone, but also in oceanic waters surrounding the breeding islands. ","Population fluctuations are probably caused by the effects of El Niño Southern Oscillation, compounded by over-fishing, on prey abundance and consequently breeding success, and even adult survival (Velarde et al. 1994, E. Velarde in litt. 1998, Velarde 1999). During strong El Niño years breeding success collapses to near zero, in comparison to around 0.5 in a typical year, and individual female mass is greatly reduced (Case et al. 2002). Ocean warming events and high sea surface temperature (SST) conditions greatly impact population growth rates in Larus heermanni. Under stable, normal SST conditions, population growth is estimated at ~4% however under high SST conditions, anomalously warm temperatures can result in a decline in population growth of up to 15%. Whilst the species can resist oceanographic anomalies of up to 1 event every 5 years without compromising population growth rates, the increasing frequency of anomalously warm SST conditions will likely facilitate increasingly rapid and severe population declines in the decades to come (Velarde and Ezcurra 2018).About 90% of the global population exists on Isla Rasa, a basalt platform of 0.68 km2 and, as such, the occupied breeding range is very small. However, Isla Rasa was declared a sanctuary in 1964 (Anderson et al. 1976), and has been well-managed during the breeding season by resident biologists, who discourage egg-collecting and disturbance (E. Velarde in litt. 1998, B. Tershy and B. Keitt in litt. 1999). Commercial egg collection prior to the declaration of Isla Rasa as a sanctuary considerably reduced the population (Bowen et al. 2015). Any weakening of protection on the island may see an increase in egg collection once again, and there is little protection for breeding attempts on other islands, though these are only a small percentage of the population. Introduced black rats Rattus rattus and house mice Mus musculus were eradicated from Isla Rasa in 1995, and reproductive success in Heermann’s Gulls doubled in the areas where rodents were previously most prevalent (Bowen et al. 2015). It is likely that these invasive species impact breeding attempts on additional islands. Heermann’s Gulls may be at risk from pollution, cadmium concentrations during two seasons were found to be above threshold levels for adverse impacts on reproduction and survival, and were the highest recorded in a study of 8 seabird species in coastal Sinaloa (Ceyca et al. 2016). The impact of this contamination is currently unknown. ","Larus heermanni is estimated to have a population of 350,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019), ~92% of which nest on Isla Rasa, Mexico (Burger and Gochfeld 1996). Numbers on Isla Rasa are similar to estimates in the late 1960s, but there have been significant fluctuations with a low of 55,000 pairs in 1975 (Burger and Gochfeld 1996). There are further throughout to be 150 pairs on George Island, 1,500 on Cholluda (Burger and Gochfeld 1996), 4,000 on Cardonosa and 200 breeding individuals on San Il de Fonso (Velarde 1999) however, more recent surveys are required to confirm such figures.",Unknown,"Larus heermanni has a population of approximately 283,000 to 300,000 breeding adults (Kushlan et al. 2002), 92% of which nest on Isla Rasa, Mexico (Burger and Gochfeld 1996).

Trends in Russia are less clear, but it is likely that overall the species is undergoing rapid declines over three generations, and it is therefore listed as Vulnerable. Precise drivers of declines are unclear, but likely include habitat modification, predation, egg harvesting and human disturbance.","This species is found over the waters of the Arctic and subarctic coastal plains. It feeds mainly on small fish which it catches by surface-dipping. Laying mainly occurs in June, usually in small monospecific colonies on a variety of habitats up to 20 km inland (del Hoyo et al. 1996).","No single main driver of declines has been identified but several factors including habitat degradation, predation, egg harvesting and disturbance by humans likely play a substantial role in population change at local scales, and may have a cumulative impact at the population level. Eggs and chicks are reportedly depredated by introduced species such as Arctic Fox Vulpes lagopus and Red Fox V. vulpes, Brown Rats Rattus norvegicus, and domestic dogs. Natural predators include American Mink Mustela vison, bears Ursus spp. and a variety of bird species. Some chicks may also be killed by Arctic Terns Sterna paradisaea (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2006), however breeding success in the species is lower in the absence of Arctic Terns as they benefit from their aggressive colony defence. Aleutian Terns are very sensitive to disturbance at colonies and may seasonally or even permanently abandon colonies in response to human disturbance (Gochfield et al. 2018). Complete colony abandonment has been observed following a single visit by humans (Haney et al. 1991).Widespread declines across a coastline as large as Alaska’s suggest that declines are not strictly caused by local factors. Shifts in prey distribution due to climate change impacts may be having a particular impact on the species at a large scale. Within a mixed colony, provisioning rates of Arctic Terns were found to be higher than for Aleutian Terns (Gochfield et al. 2018), implying a divergence in preferred prey availability. The cause of this prey limitation may be highly relevant to the declines in the species: it may be that ongoing shifts in the marine habitat have particularly negative consequences for this species.It is also possible that threats that are yet to be determined are acting on the species along its migratory route and in the wintering areas, which are particularly poorly known (M. Rauzon / Pacific Seabird Group in litt. 2017).","Previous published population estimates for Alaska ranged from 9,000 to 12,000 birds, and estimates for Russia ranged from 7,200 to 13,000, although they were based on data that are more than 20 years old (H. Renner in litt. 2013). Wetlands International estimated a total population of 17,000-20,000 individuals in 2005, including 9,500 birds in Alaska (Wetlands International 2020), based on data from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (2006), and the total population was therefore placed in the range 11,000-13,000 mature individuals. Partners in Flight (2019) placed the number of mature individuals at 22,000 based on 2015 estimates however, a subsequent range-wide assessment of population and trends estimated a minimum worldwide breeding population of 31,131 birds across 202 colonies, with 18% (5,529 birds in 110 colonies) in Alaska and 82% (25,602 birds in 92 colonies) in Russia (Renner et al. 2015). It does not account for colonies that have not been surveyed in recent years or for the fact that the surveys conducted were neither systematic nor inclusive of all potential habitats (Renner et al. 2015) and thus the total population may be higher. Based on the minimum total recorded by Renner et al. (2015), the global population estimate has therefore been revised to 31,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species breeds in the north Pacific Ocean on the coasts of Sakhalin and Kamchatka, Russia, on the Bering and Pacific coasts of Alaska (U.S.A.) and on the Aleutian Islands (U.S.A.). It is strongly migratory with one of the longest distance terrestrial vertebrate migrations ever recorded, ~16,000 km one-way between Alaska/Russia and Southeast Asia/Oceania (Goldstein et al. 2019).

It is also subject to large population fluctuations in response to climatic effects, and could be negatively affected by climate change, human intrusions and overfishing.","This species breeds on flat rocky areas and is strongly tied to the coast. It forages in inshore waters, estuarine habitats, salt ponds and lagoons, with some individuals venturing further offshore in the non-breeding season.","Declines in the fish stocks (e.g. sardines) due to overfishing, as well as fluctuations in stock due to El Niño events and sea surface temperature anomalies, cause dramatic fluctuations in the numbers of Elegant Terns, as well as large-scale migrations to new nesting sites. Previously, Elegant Terns have shown high fidelity to breeding on Isla Rasa, with 90% of the population breeding on this island prior to 2000, even in adverse years. More recently there has been no successful nesting on Isla Rasa in 2003, 2009, 2010 or 2014 with each of these years being preceded by seasons of particularly high fishing effort. Warm sea surface temperature anomalies are thought to be the main factor determining the proportion of the tern population nesting away from Isla Rasa and the surrounding region, but fishing effort and total landings during the previous year also have a significant impact (Velarde et al. 2015). Currently, when the sea surface temperature anomaly around Isla Rasa is over 1°C, more than 70% of total Elegant tern nesting population is observed in three Californian colonies, especially in San Diego, compared to less than 20% in years with a sea surface temperature anomaly of less than 1°C (Velarde et al. 2015). Although human disturbance is not currently a significant threat to this species, as Elegant Terns move to nesting in more populated areas, such as San Diego, the impact of disturbance on nesting birds may increase. Rats Rattus spp. were a problem on Isla Rasa until their successful eradication in 2009, upon which numbers of birds increased five-fold (Samaniego-Herrera et al. 2011). Rats are unlikely to return to Isla Rasa, but as Elegant Terns move to new, less protected, breeding locations on mainland they may be vulnerable to future impacts of invasive species such as rats and feral dogs (Rankin 2016). Historically, the Isla Rasa colony was nearly eliminated by eggers. This became illegal in 1960s and ended in the early 1980s (Velarde et al. 2015), as such, it is unlikely to return to Isla Rasa, but may pose a threat to new breeding colonies nesting in less well protected areas.","The estimated population is 51,000-90,000 individuals (Kushlan et al. 2002) with up to 95% breeding on Isla Rasa in the Gulf of California (Velarde and Anderson 1994). At least three other Mexican islands are used at least occasionally (Velarde and Anderson 1994). In addition, small populations breed on Bolsa Chica (50-4,000 pairs, first recorded in 1987), in San Diego bay (500-800 pairs) and in Los Angeles Harbour (Velarde and Anderson 1994, Gochfeld and Burger 1996, E.

Forest areas with multiple canopy layers and high moss abundance are strongly preferred. Research in British Columbia shows that in areas where forest habitat is relatively plentiful the species seldom re-use the same trees as nest sites, whereas in areas where logging has reduced old-growth there is a higher proportion of nest tree re-use (Burger et al. 2009). The species has been shown to suffer increased predation and disturbance at forest edges adjacent to recently cleared areas, compared with forest edges adjacent to regenerating or riparian areas (Malt and Lank 2009). Multiple radar and modelling studies have shown a significant correlation between numbers of birds entering watersheds and the areas of suitable forest habitat within those watersheds (Burger 2002, Burger et al. 2004, Raphael et al. 2011). Breeding is mid-March to early September in California, but more compressed further north (Hamer and Nelson 1995a, b, Gaston and Jones 1998, Burger 2002). The diet is sandlance, herring, other small schooling fish and, in winter, invertebrates (Gaston and Jones 1998, Piatt et al. 2006). Chicks are generally fed large subadult or adult prey rather than juveniles or larvae (Piatt et al. 2006). It feeds in near-shore habitats up to 1.4 km offshore, in sheltered waters, lagoons and sometimes inland lakes (Carter 1986, Hunt 1995, Gaston and Jones 1998, Burger 2002, Hebert and Golightly 2008). The effect of marine attributes on murrelet productivity varies from increasing density and productivity estimates with increasing sea surface temperature in the San Juan Archipelago, Washington (1995-2007; Raphael and Bloxton 2008), to decreasing reproductive efforts with warmer sea-surface temperatures in California (Bigger and Chinnici 2008). Sea-surface temperatures and other marine attributes explained little of the variation in murrelet distribution and abundance compared to the amount and cohesion of forest nesting habitat (Raphael et al. 2015). Daily movements to feeding areas can be up to 250 km in exceptional cases (Whitworth et al. 2000), but are normally about 30 km (Burger 2002, Piatt et al. 2006). Radio-marked birds from Redwood Creek in North California moved a maximum average distance of 99 km alongshore, with males travelling further than females, and non-breeding males travelling further than breeding males, perhaps in search of mates or nesting habitats. Average home range size was 505 km2, again being greater for males than females (Hebert and Golightly 2008). Individuals exhibit plasticity in their foraging behaviour, foraging closer to shore and increasing dive rates during nesting (Peery et al. 2009). Marbled Murrelets most often forage in pairs (Piatt et al. 2006). Individuals in the northern part of its range may travel south during the non-breeding season, a movement which likely reflects the availability of prey (Piatt et al. 2006).","Loss of nesting habitat is strongly linked to population decline through most of the species’s range (Burger 2002, Piatt et al. 2006, Burger and Waterhouse 2009). The massive (85–90%) reduction in old-growth forest (nesting habitat) in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia due to logging likely drove the decline and fragmentation of Murrelet populations in these regions (Sealy and Carter 1984, Rodway et al. 1992, Stein and Miller 1992). Forest loss and fragmentation continues, with the area of 'higher-suitability' habitat declining by 12% between 1993 and 2012 (c.18% in three generations), most of which occurred on non-federal land (Falxa and Raphael 2016). In accordance, Long et al. (2011) estimated that suitable nesting habitat declined by 20-22% between 1978 and 2008 in British Columbia. Multiple radar studies have shown that when breeding habitat is reduced by logging, the birds do not show ability to relocate to remaining forest patches in higher densities, but instead suffer population declines (Burger 2001, Burger et al. 2004, Raphael et al. 2006), and there is strong support for habitat loss due to logging being the primary driving mechanism for the population decline (Burger 2002). A linked threat is the elevated predation pressures at range margins. Murrelet distribution and abundance is directly correlated to the amount and cohesion of forest nesting habitat (Raphael et al. 2015) and the species has been found to suffer increased corvid (jays and ravens) predation and disturbance at forest edges adjacent to recently cleared areas (Burger 2002, Malt and Lank 2009). Other experiments found that the rate of predation of artificial nests on the Olympic Peninsula was significantly correlated with corvid abundance (Miller et al. 2012).In addition, the species is at risk from interaction with commercial fisheries, and changes in prey availability caused by the combined effects of overharvesting and climate change. In 1990, an estimated 1,468 seabirds were killed in fishing nets, 97% of which were Murrelets. Murrelet mortality was strongly associated with gill-net mortality off the Washington coast and some 3300 (2940 adult) Murrelets may drown in fish nets annually throughout their range in Alaska. Assuming a population size of 280,000 individuals, of which 70% are adult breeders, then as much as 1.5% of adult mortality may derive from bycatch. And yet, this estimate does not include mortality in set nets, pound nets or seine nets (Piatt and Naslund 1995). Intense exploitation of prey species during the last century have contributed to depleting the Murrelet’s preferred food resources, causing a shift to lower-trophic-level food items (i.e. krill, sandlance and rockfishes), which appears to have been partly responsible for poor Murrelet reproduction. The decrease in trophic level was most pronounced in pre-breeding diets, which plays a crucial role in alcid life history (Becker and Bessinger 2006). Since the collapse of the Pacific sardine populations, prey quality and abundance has declined, with lower trophic-level prey (e.g. krill) now dominating the pre-breeding diet in California (Becker and Bessinger 2006). This has resulted in a lower proportion of individuals reaching breeding condition, and therefore lower population productivity.Climate change is likely exacerbating the reductions in food availability, through changes in sea water temperatures, composition of marine fish communities, and reduced overall fish biomass with dramatic consequences in the diet and population ecology of higher vertebrates that depend on those fish populations (Piatt and Anderson, in press). Occurrence of the species on the San Juan Islands, Washington is positively correlated with winter El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices suggesting that species are required to use the area as a refuge due to concurrent declines in prey availability along the outer Pacific Coast in ENSO years (Lorenz and Raphael 2018). Unlike short-term phenomena, such as ENSO events, the predicted long-term shifts due to climate change represent a more pervasive and persistent change in the ecosystem and can potentially have long-term effects on Alaskan Murrelet populations (Piatt and Naslund 1995). Miller et al. (2012) attributed the 2000-2010 population decline to changes in the marine environment causing reduced availability or quality of prey (among other factors), and juvenile recruitment off Vancouver Island was significantly reduced in a year of low marine productivity and prey availability (Ronconi and Burger 2008). Climate change may also result in changes to the distribution of the coniferous forests required for nesting by the Murrelets (DellaSala et al. 2015).Mortality due to oil pollution represents another major threat to Marbled Murrelet populations. Past spills (e.g. Apex Houston, Exxon Valdez, Nestucca and New Carissa) have cause considerable mortality in affected colonies (Piatt and Naslund 1995, Nelson 1997, Gaston and Jones 1998, Burger 2002, Titmus and Smith 2008). The 1989 Exxon Valdez event killed an estimated 8,400 Marbled Murrelets (c.3% of the Alaskan population) and the toll from chronic pollution is unknown (Piatt and Naslund 1995). Future oil spills will continue to threaten the viability of small, declining populations, especially in California, Oregon and Washington where a single large spill could potentially extirpate an entire population (Carter and Kuletz 1995). There is also strong potential for direct interaction between the species and tanker traffic along the proposed ""Northern Gateway"" tanker traffic routes (Bertram et al. 2016). Owing to their coastal distribution and use of relatively sheltered marine habitats, Murrelets are more exposed to vessel activities than most other seabirds in the region. Human disturbance can disrupt foraging birds and persistent boat traffic may displace birds from important foraging areas. Carter and Kuletz (1995) found that Murrelet numbers were negatively correlated with numbers of boats and low-flying aircrafts, and presented suggestive evidence that human disturbance and traffic caused disruptions to breeding.","COSEWIC (2012) estimated the total population to number 358,200-417,500 individuals, rounded here to 350,000-420,000 individuals, based on 271,000 individuals in Alaska (Piatt et al. 2007), 72,600-125,600 in British Columbia (Bertram et al. 2007), and 15,400-23,900 individuals in Washington, Oregon and California (Falxa et al. 2014, Falxa and Raphael 2016). This range equates to 238,800-278,300 mature individuals, rounded here to 240,000-280,000. The latest estimate from Partners in Flight (2019) suggests a population of mature individuals of 260,000.",Decreasing,"Brachyramphus marmoratus occurs in the U.S.A. and Canada in California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, south-east Alaska, Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, Lower Cook Inlet, Barren Islands, Afognak and Kodiak Islands, the Alaska Peninsula and the Aleutians locally to Andreanof and Near Islands (Gaston and Jones 1998). In Alaska (70% of the population), historical estimates place the population at c. 750,000 individuals, though when trend estimates are applied to this figure it gives an estimated 2006 population of c. 271,000 individuals (Piatt et al. 2007). The British Columbia population was previously thought to be c. 54,000 - 92,500 (Piatt et al. 2006) but extrapolations from recent radar counts suggest the population may in fact be c. 72,600-125,600 birds (COSEWIC 2012). This higher estimate is likely due to differences in survey methodology as opposed to a genuine population increase. The population in Washington, Oregon and California is estimated at 15,400-23,900 individuals (Falxa et al. 2014, Falxa and Raphael 2016). The greatest historical decreases have occurred in Washington, Oregon and California (A. Burger in litt. 2012, Falxa and Raphael 2016). Declines are also reported in British Columbia and south-east Alaska (Perry 1995). Trend analyses conducted during 2000-2013 suggest a decline of c.11% over the period in Washington, Oregon and California (Falxa et al. 2014, Falxa and Raphael 2016), and a decrease of c.70% in Alaska from the 1980s to 2006 (Piatt et al. 2006). At-sea surveys over the past 25 years in British Columbia suggest declines of c.1% per year (Piatt et al. 2006), although radar surveys suggest the population may have been relatively stable since 1999 with declines in some regions of British Columbia (COSEWIC 2012, Bertram et al. 2015). Availability of nesting habitat in British Columbia, which is strongly correlated with local breeding populations (Burger 2001, Burger et al. 2004), has declined by 22%  between  1978 and 2008, and is continuing (COSEWIC 2012). ","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions Underway It is Threatened in all range states and provinces except Alaska. Detailed conservation recommendations were made in 1990s (USFWS 1992, Ralph et al. 1995) with a Habitat Conservation Plan drafted in 1997 for Washington State (Wilson 2019). Federal land-use in the USA is regulated, areas for management identified and surveyed, and some temporarily removed from logging (Nelson 1997, Raphael 2006). In August 2016, the USFWS released the final determination on critical habitat for the species in the listed range and in January 2010 determined that the species still warrented protection and listing as Threatened after numerous challenges by the timber industry. USFWS initiated a status review of the species in 2008, which will also function as a 5-year status review. In Canada there has been extensive research, an updated recovery strategy (Environment Canada 2014), some (relatively minor) habitat protection under the British Columbia Forest and Range Practices Act, more extensive protection of forest habitat under various Land Use agreements and a radar monitoring plan developed by the Canadian Marbled Murrelet Recovery Team (CMMRT 2003, COSEWIC 2012). The Canadian Marbled Murrelet Recovery Team developed a Recovery Strategy to be compliant with the Canadian Species at Risk Act (Environment Canada 2014). This lays out the general strategy for population stability (population reduction between 2002 and 2032 not to exceed 30% of the 2002 population and this decline is linked to similar limited decline in available suitable nesting habitat). The essential Marine and Terrestrial Action Plans required by the Species at Risk Act have not been drafted (as of 2016) and these are not likely to be completed and implemented before 2020. Under the Canadian Recovery Strategy critical nesting habitat requiring protection is defined as 70% of the 2002 suitable nesting habitat coast-wide, with varying percentages (68-90%) in the six conservation regions in British Columbia (Environment Canada 2014). The U.S. Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) began developing a Marbled Murrelet Long-Term Conservation Strategy in 2007 (Escene 2007); the final strategy still has not been released as of 2016. The Northwest Forest Plan (1994) is expected to ensure the protection of a large proportion of important habitats in the USA (Raphael 2006). Extensive areas of suitable forest nesting habitat have been set aside in conservancies on the northern and central mainland and in Haida Gwaii (formerly Queen Charlotte Islands) (COSEWIC 2012). Smaller areas are being protected by other forestry and conservation measures. Overall, an estimated 35% of the 1,826,828 hectares of  suitable habitat in all of British Columbia (based on the Canadian Marbled Murrelet Recovery Team modeling criteria [CMMRT 2003]) had been protected under various measures by 2011 (COSEWIC 2012). In 1998, the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council protected 179 km2 of Afognak Island (BBC Wildlife 1999 172: 23). In 2007, 1,569 ha of forested land on the Oregon Coast was acquired under conservation easement for the species (amongst others), part funded by the New Carissa oil-spill funds (Escene 2007). Between 1998 and 2002, 507 Marbled Murrelets were radio-tracked in British Columbia (Zharikov et al. 2007), during 2005-2007, 111 birds were radio-tracked at Port Snettisham, Alaska (Nelson et al. 2008), and between 2004-2008, 157 birds were radio-tagged on Olympic Peninsula, Washington to determine nesting habitat, activity patterns and distribution. A recommended protocol for surveying the species in forests was published in 2003 by PSG (Mack et al. 2003). In British Columbia standard protocols have been developed for various survey methods (RISC 2001, Manley 2006). Research has shown that habitat management at relatively fine scales may provide conservation benefits (Horton 2008) and that the species would benefit from a reduction in the amount of hard edges (recent clear-cuts) at both patch and landscape scales (Malt and Lank 2009). Conservation Actions Proposed Survey potential nesting habitat on all ownerships and protect all occupied sites. Collect data on the ratio of juvenile to adult birds from sites throughout the range, and monitor over time, as this is thought to be a reliable indicator of productivity (Peery et al. 2007). Research means of improving the abundance of high quality food, e.g. small fish, during the pre-breeding period. Minimise damage to fish stocks and feeding areas (RENEW Report 1999 9: 20). Conduct research on the behaviour of migrants to determine the extent to which dispersal results in gene flow and prevents declines in resident populations (Peery et al. 2010). Complete and implement the SARA-compliant Canadian Marbled Murrelet Recovery Action Plans needed to implement the Canadian Recovery Strategy (Environment Canada 2014). Protect both terrestrial nesting habitat and marine habitat throughout the species's range (Lorenz et al. 2016), create larger blocks of habitat, provide buffers and other means for minimizing edge effects and predation (K. J. Kuletz in litt. 1999, USFWS 2012). Renew the radar monitoring at British Columbia watersheds (Bertram et al. 2015), in order to track population trends and determine the effects of habitat removal (logging) and local changes in marine conditions. Move campgrounds away from old-growth areas in Californian State Parks, in order to reduce predator populations in breeding areas. Reduce oil-spills, gill-net mortality and logging (K. J. Kuletz in litt. 1999). List as Threatened in Alaska (K. J. Kuletz in litt. 1999).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
178995789,62101249,Synthliboramphus scrippsi,Vulnerable,"B2ab(iv,v)",2020,2020-08-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Vulnerable because it occupies a small range when breeding, nests on a limited number of islands and islets and is thought to be in on-going decline owing mainly to the impacts of invasive mammalian predators. Predator eradication is currently ongoing however and if a population recovery is evidenced, this species may qualify for downlisting to a lower threat category. Similarly, if the species is confirmed to be breeding at more than 10 locations, downlisting may also be warranted. Until such confirmation however, the species is precautionarily retained as Vulnerable.","It nests on steep sea-slopes, canyons and cliffs with a sparse cover of herbaceous and shrubby plants (Drost and Lewis 1995). It is a generalist predator and may exploit higher prey concentrations around pelagic convergence lines (Hamilton et al. 2004). Around Santa Barbara, it feeds on larval fish, especially Northern Anchovy Engraulis mordax (Hunt and Butler 1980, Hunt et al. 1981). Breeding effort and performance are lower when anchovy abundance is low (Hunt and Butler 1980). Adults enter and leave the nesting colonies at night when there is little or no moon, typically arriving on the Channel Islands in mid-February. Nesting persists through mid-June with peak nesting from late March to late April (Jones et al. 2005). Clutches consist of two eggs laid approximately eight days apart with replacement of lost clutches unusual. Incubation takes c.34 days (Jones et al. 2005). There are no recent records of them breeding under shrubs on top of Anacapa Island, a habitat used frequently on nearby, rat-free, Santa Barbara Island (Jones et al. 2005).","Invasive mammals were responsible for all known and suspected colony extinctions in the past and pose an ongoing threat by being present in all the larger colonies and former colonies (McChesney and Tershy 1998). Feral cats Felis catus depredate chicks and adults. Heavy cat predation was recorded on North Coronado until the mid-1990s (Jehl and Bond 1975, Drost and Lewis 1995). The cat population at Catalina was most recently estimated at 600-750 individuals (Guttila and Stapp 2010) and eradication of cats and rats on the island has been regarded as ‘not currently feasible’ (Whitworth et al. 2014). Despite this however, many introduced predators have been removed from a number of breeding islands in recent decades (McChesney and Tershy 1998, Keitt 2005, Birt et al. 2012) with post-eradication increases noted (Whitworth and Carter 2017); the eradication of cats on some islands off the coast of western Baja California (Islas Coronado, Todos Santos, San Martín and San Benito) in the late-1990s has likely resulted in recent population increases in such localities (Whitworth et al. 2020). Black Rats Rattus rattus prey on murrelet eggs and adults (Whitworth et al. 2014). Eradication of rats at Anacapa Island in 2001–2002 greatly improved murrelet hatching success in the following years (2003–2010) (Whitworth et al. 2005, 2013), with 191% more eggs hatching and 94% fewer nests being depredated (Newton et al. 2016). Hatching success remains very low on islands including St. Clementine however, a result of ongoing predation by foxes and black rats (Whitworth et al. 2018). House Mice Mus musculus were recently introduced to the Coronados Islands, and Deer Mice Peromyscus maniculatus anacapae (native to nearby Cedros Island) have also been introduced to the San Benito Islands. Deer Mice depredated 46% of all monitored eggs on Santa Barbara (Murray et al. 1983), which is the largest known breeding site for the species (Howard et al. 2014). However, on Anacapa, Deer Mice were established long before the introduction of rats, precluding them from consideration as the cause of declines there (Jones et al. 2005). Another problematic native species is the Barn Owl Tyto alba. Annual estimates of owl predation on Santa Barbara range from 11 to 172 individuals (Thomsen and Harvey 2012, Thomsen et al. 2013, Nur et al. 2013). Population growth modelling based on data collected between 1991 and 2010, resulted in an estimate of a 1.17% population decline owing to owl predation, and projections of a hypothetical 50-80% reduction in predation pressure could potentially result in a 1.15-2.54% positive growth rate, barring an increase in egg depredation from island mouse populations (Nur et al. 2013). This assessment implicated the role of Barn Owls in the suppression of the Scripps’s Murrelet population recovery on Santa Barbara Island although recent evidence suggests that the presence of Barn Owls on Santa Barbara may have an indirect positive influence on Murrelet egg survival through increased predation on deer mice, and resultantly reduced egg predation from the mice themselves (Thomsen and Green 2016). Such interactions however, have been shown to shift with changing El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) rainfall conditions as changing rainfall, vegetation abundance and resultantly deer mouse populations can result in 15-fold increases in the predation of Murrelet by Owls in the absence of mice as a food source (Thomsen et al. 2018). It has recently been evidenced that fecundity is dramatically reduced during drought years due to enhanced egg predation by deer mice and population declines may result (Thomsen and Green 2019). Any increase in the frequency or severity of drought conditions will likely increase the rate of population decline in response. Various forms of pollution are threatening the species. The potential impacts of large and small oil spills in congregation waters near breeding islands is of great concern (Carter et al. 2000, Burkett et al. 2003). Long Beach Harbour is the largest oil port in western North America, with daily arrivals and departures of large oil tankers (USFWS 2005). Frequent oil spills occur in the vicinity of Long Beach Harbour, but most have not affected waters near Catalina (Carter 2003, Whitworth et al. 2014). As stated by Drost and Lewis (1995), pollution from offshore oil-wells or the Los Angeles oil-tanker lane could potentially extirpate the species from the south California Bight. Organochlorine pollutants are considered not to have a current significant effect on murrelets breeding at Catalina, but may have caused reduced reproduction or population size in the past, especially between the 1940s and 1970s, prior to the end of production and dumping of DDT in southern California waters (Drost and Lewis 1995, Whitworth et al. 2014). The potential impacts of bright lights used by squid fishing boats near breeding colonies is another concern, potentially causing disorientation and elevated predation pressures. Many owl-predated murrelets were found during a period of intense inshore squid fishing around Santa Catalina and disturbance from related activities could discourage nest-visitation and possibly cause collision mortalities (Whitworth et al. 2014). Human disturbance has been identified as a cause of nest abandonment and a major threat to the species (Howard et al. 2015). The two highest rates of abandonment on record were observed at the Dock and the Bunkhouse plots, which are directly associated with human structures. The human disturbance associated with these sites may also affect the remaining nesting birds. Machinery operations at the dock include high decibel engine noise and vibration of the dock structure, which along with frequent traffic, could be affecting nesting murrelets beneath the decking of these structures (Howard et al. 2015).Extreme fluctuations of sea surface temperature related to ENSO, are likely to affect food availability for the species, though the impact of such events appears to be small due to their generalist prey (USFWS 2016). In addition, the species's foraging behaviour puts it at risk from gill-net fisheries, although very few incidences have been reported (Carter et al. 2000). No mortality has been reported in nearshore gill-net fisheries in which other seabirds have relatively high bycatch rates (Pacific Seabird Group undated). However, the white seabass gill-net fishery operating around the northern California Channel Islands has very little observer coverage, potentially indicating that bycatch incidence has been underestimated or completely overlooked (Pacific Seabird Group undated).","Birt et al. (2012) estimate the total number of breeding pairs to be in excess of 6,500, which equated to 13,000 mature individuals. Partners in Flight (2019) estimate the population at 15,000, hence it is placed here in the band for 10,000-19,999 mature individuals, assumed to equate to 15,000-30,000 individuals in total.",Decreasing,"Synthliboramphus scrippsi breeds on islands off southern California, U.S.A. (San Miguel, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, Santa Barbara, San Clemente, and, formerly, Santa Catalina) and western Baja California, Mexico (San Benito, Todos Santos and the Coronado and San Jerónimo islands) (Chesser et al. 2012, Whitworth et al. 2020). On large islands, the species is confined largely or entirely to offshore rocks (Drost and Lewis 1995). Breeding on San Martín and Cedros Islands, Baja California, is less certain but presumed present (Chesser et al. 2012, Whitworth et al. 2020). In the U.S.A., an estimated 885-2,575 breeding pairs occur, the biggest colony on the island of Santa Barbara holds 500-1,250 pairs (B. Keitt and D. Whitworth in litt. 2003). Small numbers breed on Anacapa (200-600 pairs), Santa Cruz (100-300 pairs), San Miguel (50-300 pairs), and San Clemente islands (10-50 pairs), U.S.A. (Sowls et al. 1980, Hunt et al. 1981, Carter et al. 1992, Drost and Lewis 1995). The Santa Barbara colony has been stable since the 1980s, but may have declined since the turn of the century (B. Keitt and D. Whitworth in litt. 2003). The breeding population size on the islands off western Baja California was estimated between 2002-2008 at 1686-4428 pairs, and despite likely being extirpated on all islands excluding Coronado and San Benito in the past (Bedolla-Guzmán et al. 2019), it has returned to breed at all such locations. Numbers are estimated to include 1117-2933 pairs at Isla Coronado, 262-688 at Todos Santos, 19-49 at San Martín, 24-64 at San Jerónimo, 231-607 at San Benito and 33-87 on the Cedros Islands (Whitworth et al. 2020). The eradication of cats on some such islands (Islas Coronado, Todos Santos, San Martín and San Benito) in the late-1990s has likely resulted in recent population increases in such localities. The species winters offshore from northern California (rarely) south to southern Baja California (Chesser et al. 2012). Some post-breeding birds reach Oregon, USA, and British Columbia, Canada (Gaston and Jones 1998, Karnovsky et al. 2005).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayAll potential breeding islands in the USA and Mexico have been surveyed, with the exception of the offshore rocks of Cedros Island (B. Tershy in litt. 1999). Over the past 10 years, most invasive mammals, including cats, rats, goats, sheep, rabbits, donkeys and dogs have been removed from almost all islands that are known current or suspected historical nesting sites in the US and Mexico (McChesney and Tershy 1998, B. Keitt and D. Whitworth in litt. 2003, Keitt 2005, Whitworth et al. 2005, Aguirre-Muñoz et al. 2008, Birt et al. 2012, Whitworth et al. 2020). In 2003, fishing and other extractive uses were banned within important areas of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary in an attempt to reduce light and noise pollution in important near-shore staging areas. However, the exclusion zone covers only a small buffer area around some colonies, and may be ineffective at minimising threats (S. Wolf in litt. 2007). A pilot habitat restoration for the species has begun on Santa Barbara Island (Wolf 2008). Conservation Actions ProposedEradicate introduced predators on other small islands (Drost and Lewis 1995), including the invasive house mice from Coronados Island and recently introduced deermice from the Western San Benito Island (B. Tershy in litt. 2007). Develop contingency plans to prevent the establishment of new predator populations (Drost and Lewis 1995). Survey remaining potential breeding islands (Drost and Lewis 1995).

It consequently qualifies as Vulnerable.","One to two eggs are laid on bare rock or soft substrate at the end of a rock-cavity or crevice, but also in ground-burrows, under dense shrubs and boulders from just above the high-tide mark to several dozen meters up sea-facing slopes (DeWeese and Anderson 1976, Gaston and Jones 1998, Velarde et al. 2011). Mean clutch sizes are 1.4 (n=23) (F. Méndez-Sánchez in litt. 2020). Colony size can vary from a few nests to several dozens (2-52 nests in the Gulf of California, 1-7 nests in the Pacific) as well as at-sea congregations (1-87 individuals in the Gulf of California, 9-130 individuals in the Pacific) (Whithworth et al. 2017, F. Méndez-Sánchez in litt. 2020). In the Gulf of California, eggs are laid in early February-March and chicks hatch around March-April (DeWeese and Anderson 1976, Hurley and Blinick, 2011), whereas in the Pacific eggs are laid in early April and chicks hatch in May (Méndez-Sánchez in litt. 2020). Hatching success is high both in the Gulf of California (90%, n=8) and in the Pacific (85%, n=10), with overall 1.2 chicks laid by each breeding pair, although numbers may vary inter-anually (F. Méndez-Sánchez in litt. 2020). Chick survival during the first month at sea is only 30-35% (DeWeese and Anderson 1976). The species feeds mainly on larval fish, especially rockfish Sebastes sp., herring (Clupeidae) and lanternfish Benthosema panamense, but also small squid and crustaceans (DeWeese and Anderson 1976).","Invasive alien species are the main threat to Craveri’s Murrelet population on their nesting sites (DeWeese Aguirre-Muñoz et al. 2018, GECI 2019a). Historically, 70% of its breeding sites were threatened by non-native predators such as cats, rats, mice which caused local extinctions (Velarde et al. 2011, Aguirre-Muñoz et al. 2018). Colonies were extirpated from San Pedro Mártir, San Jorge, Rasa, Espíritu Santo, Natividad, Asunción and San Roque islands (Velarde et al. 2011, Bedolla-Guzmán et al. 2019a). Targeted eradication efforts from 1995 to 2017 have removed invasive mammals from the majority of islands within the species' range, with the exception of the biggest islands such as Cedros, Ángel de la Guarda and San Esteban that still host these predators (Aguirre-Muñoz et al. 2018). However, the risk of reintroduction is high on inhabited islands that are now pest-free due to continuous movements from the continent by fishermen, tourists and researchers (Bedolla-Guzman et al. 2019b). Oil spills from grounding, ship collisions or sinking of ships, as well as pipelines near the coast and pollution from offshore wells could threaten a large percentage of breeding adults (Velarde and Anderson 1994). On the Pacific coasts of California, Washington, and British Columbia, where the species is distributed during the non-breeding season, large oil spills have occurred with serious ecological implications (the pipeline failure in Refugio State Beach, California, in 2015; Exxon Valdez oil spill due to a collision with the Bligh Reef, in Prince William Sound, Alaska, in 1989). Agriculture and forestry represent another source of pollutants. In the Yaqui Valley, fertilizer application rates are extremely high (250 kg of nitrogen per ha) and these materials are quickly washed out by surface water run-off from irrigation. Berman et al. (2005) used satellite imagery to demonstrate the relation of irrigation activity and run-off intensity to meso-scale phytoplankton blooms. Further, they suggested that up to 22% of the annual chlorophyll variability in the Gulf of California is related to the nitrogen run-off from the Yaqui Valley (Lluch-Cota et al. 2007), which could cause direct mortality of murrelets and also degrade the ecosystem, potentially reducing prey availability. The species if thought to be at risk from incidental capture in small- and large-scale fisheries, though the impact has not been quantified.During its breeding season, Craveri's Murrelet acquires nocturnal habits that allow it to evade certain predators (Montevecchi 2006). However, there are populations of birds that have the potential to become abundant by anthropogenic facilitation and this process must be monitored, as is the case for Western Gull (Larus occidentalis), Yellow-footed Gull (Larus livens) and Common Raven (Corvus corax). Other predator native species that cohabitate with Craveri's Murrelet on islands are Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus), Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) and Barn Owl (Tyto alba). The impact of these predators on the demography of Craveri's Murrelet has not yet been evaluated (GECI, 2019). Light pollution at-sea could represent another potential threat for the species, especially those caused by squid fishery that can extend from the Gulf of California to the western coast of the Baja California Peninsula (SAGARPA 2014). This type of light pollution could prevent nocturnal seabirds from approaching their breeding sites, or being attracted to and getting trapped in fishing nets, or colliding with the boats. Plastic ingestion has been recorded in murrelets (Avery-Gomm et al. 2013), however, there is still no evidence of plastic intake or damage by plastics in Craveri's Murrelet, thus, this threat also needs more exploration. ","Partners in Flight (2019) estimate the population of Synthliboramphus craveri to total 8,000 mature individuals, or 12,000 individuals. Such estimates are marginally less than Gaston and Jones's (1998) older estimate of  15,000-20,000 birds and Pitman et al.'s (1995) at-sea survey estimate of c.22,000 birds, as would be expected given the moderate ongoing population declines.",Decreasing,"Synthliboramphus craveri is endemic to Mexico, scattered throughout the Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of the Baja California Peninsula (Everett and Anderson 1991).

On the Pacific coast, it breeds on islands: San Martín, San Benito, Cedros, Natividad, Asunción and San Roque (Velarde et al. 2011, Whitworth et al. 2018, GECI 2019a, Bedolla-Guzmán et al. 2019b). The population, with pre-breeders, is probably 15,000-20,000 birds (Gaston and Jones 1998), which is similar to an at-sea survey estimate of c.22,000 birds (Pitman et al. 1995). Recent ground and at-sea surveys around Midriff islands and Baja California Pacific islands indicated the presence of less than 1,000 individuals (F. Méndez-Sánchez in litt. 2020). The species winters in the Gulf of California and along the coast to south California (U.S.A.), Sonora (Mexico) and possibly Guatemala (DeWeese and Anderson 1976, Tershy et al. 1993).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIn Mexico is listed as Endangered by the Mexican Official Standard, NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 (DOF 2010) and all breeding sites are part of Natural Protected Areas. In the Gulf of California, all the terrestrial parts of the islands are part of the Flora and Fauna Protection Area ""Islas del Golfo de California"" (SEMARNAT 2000), also inscribed on the UNESCO's World Natural Heritage list, and there are several marine protected areas (CONANP 2007, SEMARNAT 2014a, 2014b). San Pedro Mártir Biosphere Reserve and the National Park Zona Marina del Archipiélago Espíritu Santo were recently included in the IUCN Green List. Islands along the Pacific coast of the Baja California Peninsula are protected by El Vizcaíno Biosphere Reserve (INE 2000) and the Baja California Pacific Islands Biosphere Reserve (DOF 2016). Introduced mammals (black rat, house mouse, deer mouse, rabbit, cat and goat) were eradicated from a number of islands that are current, past or potential breeding sites. In the Gulf of California, on San Jorge (2000-2002), Mejía (1999-2001), Estanque (1999), Rasa (1995-1996), San Pedro Mártir (2007), San Francisquito (1999-2000) and Espíritu Santo (2015-2017). In the Pacific, on San Martín (1999), San Benito (1999-2013), Natividad (1997-2001), San Roque (1999) and Asunción (1999) (Tershy et al. 2002, Aguirre-Muñoz et al. 2018). Feral goat eradication on Espíritu Santo is in its final stages (F. Méndez-Sánchez in litt. 2020). Recolonization of extirpated colonies after eradications have been reported on San Pedro Mártir, San Jorge, Rasa, Natividad, Asunción and San Roque (DeWeese and Anderson 1976, Velarde et al. 2011, Aguirre-Muñoz et al. 2018, GECI, 2019a, Bedolla-Guzmán et al. 2019a, b). A conservation action plan for the species (GECI, 2019a) and an island biosecurity plan for several islands have been developed (GECI 2017, 2018, 2019b) and are now implemented by the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas in the Midriff islands (J. Zatarain-González in litt. 2020). Continuous detection monitoring of invasive mammal species is implemented on the Midriff islands (Bedolla Guzmán et al. 2017, 2019a, J. Zatarain-González in litt. 2020). Other conservation measures include continued environmental education with local communities and increased enforcement of existing regulations (J. Zatarain-González in litt. 2020). Whilst human use of the islands is increasing, it is widely monitored and under constant surveillance and regulation (J. Zatarain-González in litt. 2020). Conservation Actions ProposedEstimate population sizes with precision. Update current status at historic breeding sites throughout the Gulf of California islands: San Jorge, San Luis, Mejía, Ángel de la Guarda, Tiburón, San Esteban, San Ildefonso, Coronados, San Francisquito and Espíritu Santo (GECI 2019a). Monitor key populations. Ensure the full implementation of the management plans. Eradicate introduced predators on small islands such as Alcatraz and Mejía (GECI 2019a). Develop strategies to remove predators from larger islands such as Cedros, Ángel de la Guarda and San Esteban. Implement active restoration actions to recolonize historic breeding sites free of invasive mammals (GECI, 2019a). Implement the biosecurity plans and programs of environmental education to avoid the re-introduction of invasive mammals (GECI 2019a). Monitor all islands for new mammalian introductions. Assess the impact of gill-net fisheries (Everett and Anderson 1991). Renovate and install warning and instructive signs on the islands. Regulate tourism on Baja California islands (Velarde and Anderson 1994). Reduce the risk from pesticides and oil spills (Velarde et al. 2011). ",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

The newly-introduced tree disease known as Rapid 'Öhi'a Death may also cause declines. Overall, a population reduction of 30-49% is suspected to occur over the next ten years and so the species is listed as Vulnerable.","It occurs primarily in mesic and wet forests dominated by ‘öhi‘a and koa (Scott et al. 1986). It was formerly found in forests at any elevation, and still occurs in a variety of native, disturbed and unnatural habitats from 300 to 2,900 m (Berger 1972, Scott et al. 1986). The greatest densities (and approximately 90% of the population) are found at 1,300-1,900 m, with much lower densities below 1,000 m, except in dry areas of Kona, Hawai‘i, where moderate densities have been recorded down to 300 m (Scott et al. 1986, Paxton et al. 2013). It is nectarivorous, with nectar from 'öhi'a (Metrosideros polymorpha) and mämane (Sophora chrysophylla) forming a major part of the diet, and also feeds on foliage insects and spiders (Ralph &amp; Fancy 1995, 2020). It makes long flights to locate nectar sources and makes seasonal movements to lower altitudes in response to 'öhi'a and mämane flowering events (Ralph and Fancy 1995, Guillaumet et al. 2017). Evidence for hybrization with another honey creeper, the 'Apapane Himatione sanguinea has been documented (Knowlton et al. 2014).","The species is very susceptible to avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum) (Scott et al. 1986, Jacobi and Atikinson 1995). Malaria is transmitted by the introduced southern house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus. Nine of ten individuals bitten by a single mosquito infected with avian malaria died within 37 days (Atkinson et al. 1995). Research on the Alaka‘i Plateau found the species to have very low malaria prevalence, with just one infected individual detected in 1994 and none in the period 2007-2013, whilst research at Hakalau found an increase in malaria prevalence from 0% in 1988-1992 to 8% in 2001-2002 (VanderWerf 2012). A study on Hawai‘i island from 1992–1998 and from 2001–2005 found an overall infection rate of 2.6%, with an infection rate of 2.2% at higher elevations, and an infection rate of 20% at mid elevations (Samuel et al. 2015). The annual risk of an adult individual becoming infected with malaria was estimated at 0.23, and the mortality rate for all infected individuals was estimated at 0.93 (Samuel et al. 2015).Both the Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito and the Plasmodium relictum parasite develop more easily at higher temperatures, and the resultant prevalence of malaria at lower elevations is thought to explain the Iiwi's current concentration at higher elevations (LaPointe et al. 2010). Increased temperatures associated with climate change may increase the prevalence of malaria at higher altitudes in the future (Freed et al. 2005, Paxton et al. 2016). Research suggests that temperatures at higher elevations may now be high enough to allow mosquitoes and hence malaria to spread throughout the species's range (Atkinson et al. 2014, Paxton et al. 2016). The Iiwi's seasonal movements to lower altitudes to track floral resources also place them at increased risk from malaria (Guillaumet et al. 2017). A model of the impact of climate change predicted that the species will lose 59.9% of its range between 1990–2010 and 2080–2100 (Fortini et al. 2015). Another model of the impact of malaria under climate change projected that the species may be close to extinction by 2100 (Guillaumet et al. 2017).Recently introduced pathogens, Ceratocystis lukuohia and C. huliohia, both of which cause Rapid 'Öhi'a Death (R.O.D.), or 'Öhi'a Wilt, have spread rapidly across the Hawaiian islands and caused extensive mortality of 'öhi'a (Keith et al. 2015), which is an important food and nesting plant for Iiwi. The effects of R.O.D. were noticed on Hawai‘i by 2012, the disease was first identified in 2014 (Keith et al. 2015) and the Ceratocystis species involved were confirmed in 2018 (Barnes et al.). Ceratocystis sp. have now spread across much of the lowland forests on Hawai‘i island, as well as on Kauaʻi and Oʻahu (Mortenson et al. 2016, College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources 2020). In 2016, it was estimated that approximately 200 km2 of forest on Hawai‘i had been affected (Hughes 2016, in USFWS 2017a), including in some areas within the range of the Iiwi (Hughes 2016 and Keith 2016, in USFWS 2017b), and by 2019, more than 600 km2 of forest were affected (Fortini et al. 2019). Surveys of infected forest have found that an average of 25% of 'öhi'a trees were dead (Camp et al. 2019). Surveys in an infected area of forest found that the density of another Hawaiian honeycreeper, the Hawaii Amakihi (Chlorodrepanis virens), declined by 79% between 2003-2004 and 2016, following the infection of the forest with R.O.D. (Camp et al. 2019). If R.O.D. spreads into forest at higher elevations, if could cause rapid declines in Iiwi populations (Camp et al. 2019). Based on a model of the potential range of C. lukuohia across Hawaii under current climatic conditions (Fortini et al. 2019), it has a high chance of infecting up to around 40% of the Iiwi's range. C. lukuohia appears to be associated with higher temperatures (Fortini et al. 2019), so climate change could facilitate its spread into higher elevations.Feral ungulates, including cattle (Bos taurus), feral sheep (Ovis aries), mouflon sheep (Ovis gmelini), feral goats (Capra hircus), and Axis deer (Axis axis) have degraded habitat quality by browsing, causing soil erosion, disrupting forest regeneration, spreading alien plant seeds, and facilitating the invasion of alien plants. Feral pigs (Sus domesticus) destroy understory vegetation and provide breeding sites for mosquitoes. Invasive plants including strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) degrade habitat (VanderWerf 2012), and their invasion is likely to be facilitated by climate change (Vorsino et al. 2014). Introduced rats (Rattus sp.) may predate on the species, although there is little direct evidence for this. The species is affected by avian pox (Avipoxvirus sp.), but it is not known whether this impacts on the population size. Forests have been cleared for agriculture, cattle-ranching and development (Fancy and Ralph 2020). Historically, the species was harvested for its feathers, for use in traditional cloaks and helmets.","It has a male-biased sex ratio of 1.44:1 (Fancy et al. 1993).During 1976-1983, the population size was estimated at c.385,000 individuals, excluding birds on O`ahu (Scott et al. 1986). In the early 1990s, the total population was estimated to be more than 350,000 individuals (Jacobi and Atikinson 1995). Based on data from surveys up to 2012, using distance sampling and by multiplying density estimates by areas of habitat. the total population size was estimated to be 605,418 individuals (550,972–659,864 95% C. I.; Paxton et al. 2013). It was noted that surveys were carried out during the breeding season, when most juveniles had not fledged, so the individuals counted were mostly adults. The earlier population estimates are thought to have been understimates due to the time of year that the surveys took place (Paxton et al. 2013). The main population on Hawai‘i Island was estimated at 340,000 ± 12,000 individuals based on surveys in 1976-1983 (Scott et al. 1986). In 2012, the population on the island was estimated at 543,009 individuals (516,312–569,706 95% C.I.; Paxton et al. 2013). This included 277,055 birds in the northeastern part of the island (at Hakalau), 71,524 birds in the central eastern part of the island, 28,325 birds in the southeastern part of the island, 3,489 birds in south Kona, western Hawai‘i, 139,829 birds in central Kona, 22,787 birds in north Kona, and 802 individuals in the Kohala Mountains (based on surveys in 1976-1983; Scott et al. 1986). The 1976-1983 population in the Kohala Mountains was later re-estimated at 690 (Burnett 2020). Following further surveys in 2017, the Kohala Mountains population was estimated at 4,928 (2,910 - 8,345) individuals (Burnett 2020), although differences in survey timing may have affected the comparability of the results. At Mauna Kea, the population was estimated to number 802 birds in 1979-1983 (Scott et al.1986). During 1976-1983, the population on east Maui was estimated at 19,000 ± 2,000 individuals (Scott et al. 1986). In 2001, the population on east Maui was estimated at 107,744 individuals (Camp et al. 2009). Based on surveys in 2011 and 2012, the population on east Maui was estimated at 59,859 individuals (54,569–65,148 95% C. I; Paxton et al. 2013). The difference between the 2001 and 2011-12 estimates may be partly attributed to a decline, and partly attributed to survey error (Paxton et al. 2013). Following further surveys in 2017, the 2011-2012 population size was re-estimated at 37,574 individuals, and the 2017 east Maui population size was estimated at 50,252 (43,908–57,146 95% C. I.) individuals (Judge et al. 2019).There is a small population on west Maui. A total of 5, 2 and 11 individuals were recorded in 1980, 1997, and 2010, respectively (Paxton et al. 2013). In 1980, the population on west Maui was estimated at 180 ± 150 individuals (Scott et al. 1986).At Alaka‘i Plateau on Kaua‘i, the population numbered 7,800 ± 2,300 individuals in 1968-1973, with the total Kaui population estimated at the time to be 26,000 ±6,000 individuals (Sincock et al. 1984). 5,400 ± 500 individuals were estimated at the Alaka‘i Plateau in 1981 (Fancy and Ralph 2020). By 2004, the Kaua‘i population was estimated at 9,985 ±960 individuals (Foster et al. 2004), and in 2012, at 2,603 individuals (1,789–3,520 95% C. I.; Paxton et al. 2016).Eight individuals were recorded during surveys on O`ahu from 1994-1996 (Vanderwerf and Rohrer 1996), with the total population there suspected to be less than 50 individuals. Only a small proportion of the area of suitable elevation on the island has been surveyed (Paxton et al. 2013). The current population on O`ahu is likely to be extremely small, and perhaps no more than ten individuals (USFW 2017).On Moloka`i, 12 individuals were recorded during 120 counts in 1979-1980, and the population was estimated at 80 ± 65 (Scott et al. 1986). There have been very few records since (Paxton et al. 2013, eBird 2020). During 148 counts in 1988, only two individuals were detected (T. Pratt unpubl. data, in Fancy and Ralph 1998). Any remaining population on the island is likely to be extremely small.Based on the range of estimates, the total population size is therefore estimated at 350,000 - 601,470 individuals. Assuming that most recorded individuals were adults, and taking into account the male-biased sex ratio, the total number of mature individuals may be placed at approximately 280,000 - 481,176, and is here placed in the band 250,000 - 500,000 mature individuals.There are up to seven subpopulations: one or two on Hawai‘i Island (Scott et al. 1986), and one on each of east Maui, Kaua‘i, O`ahu, west Maui and Moloka`i (Paxton et al. 2013).",Decreasing,"Drepanis coccinea formerly occurred on all the main islands in the Hawaiian Archipelago (USA). It is now largely restricted to the islands of Hawai‘i, Maui, and Kaua‘i, with relict populations remaining on O`ahu and Moloka`i (Scott et al. 1986). On Hawai‘i, it forms a band around much of the island, with the majority of the population at Hamakua, with a separate range area at Kohala Mountain (Scott et al. 1986). On Kaua‘i, it is now restricted to a small, remote area of the Alaka‘i Plateau (Paxton et al. 2016). On Maui, the majority of the population is found at East Maui, with a small population remaining on West Maui (Scott et al. 1986). On Moloka`i, a small relict population is distributed at two areas: Olokui Plateau and Kamakou Preserve (Scott et al. 1986). On O`ahu, it occurs in three small isolated populations in the Wai‘anae and Ko‘olau Ranges (Vanderwerf and Rohrer 1996). It was extinct on Lana'i by 1929 (Munro 1944).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species was listed as Threatened under the Endangered Species Act in 2017 (USFWS 2017b).The species has been the subject of population trend analysis and detailed studies into the effects of avian malaria by the U.S. Geological Survey Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Centre. Research has been underway on methods to control mosquitoes, and on the genetic basis for malaria immunity (Paxton et al. 2018).Government and private protected areas have been established, many of which are fenced to exclude ungulates (Fancy and Ralph 2020). Alien plant species have been controlled at forest reserves (VanderWerf 2012). Forest restoration has been carried out at deforested areas (Paxton et al. 2018). Rats have been controlled in localised areas. Groups have been established to coordinate mosquito control (Paxton et al. 2018). A website has been created to disseminate information on how to prevent the spread of R.O.D., and regulations have been introduced to control the movement of 'öhi'a trees and parts (USFWS 2017a).Conservation Actions ProposedCarry out demographic studies to better understand the causes of declines. Study techniques for promoting the evolution of resistence to avian malaria. Develop techniques for controlling mosquitoes and rats. Improve monitoring of population trends at a range of elevations. Research the potential impact of R.O.D. on the species.Protect and restore native forests, especially at higher elevations. Control mosquito populations, for example, by releasing sterile males (Liao et al. 2017). Fence areas of forest to control grazing and browsing and to prevent transmission of R.O.D. by feral ungulates. Control feral pigs, particularly at higher elevations (Liao et al. 2017). Continue to control invasive alien plants. Increase public awareness of the need for mosquito control (Paxton et al. 2018). Consider providing supplementary nectar via feeders at higher elevations to discourage birds from tracking flowering events at lower elevations where they are more at risk from malaria (Guillaumet et al. 2017).",Oceanian,,false,false,Global
179376787,22681158,Leuconotopicus borealis,Near Threatened,C2a(i),2020,2020-07-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Near Threatened because its moderately small population is precautionarily assumed to be in slow decline based on known threats and local trends. In parts of the range, the species was found to be recovering due to intense conservation action.","The species inhabits fire-sustained open pine-forest, dominated in half of its range by longleaf pine Pinus palustris and elsewhere by shortleaf P. echinata, slash P. elliotti, or loblolly P. taeda pines (J. A. Jackson in litt. 1999). It is a cooperative breeder, with each group requiring at least 80 ha of habitat (Walters et al. 1988, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2003). Nesting trees appear to be selected on the rate and duration of fresh resin production, utilised by the birds to protect their nest holes from arboreal predators, such as climbing rat snakes Elaphe obsoleta (Jackson 1994). The selected tree also needs a sufficiently large, living heartwood which is infected with red heart fungus, so the tree must be over 80 years old (often 100+, age of suitability varies by pine species) (U.S. Fish and Wildlife 2003). Groups are typically comprised of a pair and up to five adult helpers, which are mostly offspring from previous years and mostly male as dispersal is female-biased (Jackson 1994, Conner et al. 2001). Eggs are laid from late April to early June (Winkler et al. 1995). Foraging habitat preferences differ between the sexes and females are negatively influenced by the loss of old-growth trees (Jackson 2000). One study showed that adults were heavier, and both adults and nestlings apparently sourced more food in shortleaf and loblolly pine habitats than in longleaf pine forest (Schaefer et al. 2004). ","Because of its biology and preference for older-growth forest, this species is said to be uniquely susceptible to rapid declines under inappropriate management regimes (J. R. Walters in litt. 2013). The long-term clearance and economic management of habitat has reduced the viability of all populations. From the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, the species decreased rapidly as mature pine forest was altered, primarily for timber harvest and agriculture (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). Longleaf pine communities in the southeastern USA may have originally covered c. 24-37 million ha, but today fewer than 1.2 million ha remain (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). The excessive cutting of old-growth forests is reported to still be taking place in some areas (J. A. Jackson in litt. 2012). Suppression of the natural fire regime allowing an increase in mid-storey hardwood density has rendered large areas of habitat unsuitable for the species (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2003). This has isolated nest-sites, making abandonment or group extirpation increasingly likely (Thomlinson 1995); translocation of these isolated groups for population augmentation elsewhere makes the loss of the site certain. Translocation of birds to federal and private lands may also swamp locally adapted gene pools (J. A. Jackson in litt. 1999). Inbreeding depression has been highlighted as a potentially serious problem in small and isolated populations (Schiegg et al. 2006), and may be exacerbated by female-biased dispersal in small and fragmented populations (Dale 2001) which appears the case for the species (Daniels and Walters 2000). Fire management (involving regular burning) has aided habitat restoration, but as human populations expand there is increasing pressure to suppress fires. Exempting landowners from the Endangered Species Act has resulted in rapid declines on private land (J. A. Jackson in litt. 1999). Loss of nesting cavities to Southern flying squirrels Glaucomys volans may contribute to breeding site limitation, as may cavity enlargement by Pileated Woodpecker Hylatomus pileatus (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2003, Saenz et al. 2008). Southern pine beetle Dendroctonus frontalis infests cavities and kills nesting trees (Conner and Rudolph 1995, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 2003) (although they have a positive effect on woodpecker foraging both as a food item, and by creating arthropod rich dead-wood habitat [Schaefer et al. 2004]). Beetle infestations have increased since habitat management for the woodpecker started in 1988 (Conner and Rudolph 1995). ","The population is estimated at 19,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).",Decreasing,"This species was originally distributed throughout the southeastern USA; however from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s, it declined rapidly due to the extensive alteration of mature pine forests (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2008). During the late 20th century it continued to decline, undergoing a large and statistically significant overall decrease between 1970 and 2014 (81% decline, data from Breeding Bird Survey and/or Christmas Bird Count [Rosenberg et al. 2016]), and James (1995) calculated a 23% decline in the number of known sites (""clusters"", groups of trees actively used by potential breeding groups of mature woodpeckers) between the early 1980s and 1990. In 1999, it was limited to c. 30 isolated populations (the largest in South Carolina and Florida), totalling c. 4,700 groups or c. 11,000 individuals and occupying just 4,000 km2 (Jackson 1994, Guynn 1997, J. A. Jackson in litt. 1999). However, the most recent population estimates suggests that the population now exceeds 10,000 mature individuals, with an estimate of 15,000 mature individuals in 2016 (Rosenberg et al. 2016) and 19,000 mature individuals in 2018 (Partners in Flight 2019), up from 14,068 individuals, arranged in 5,627 clusters (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2003). The unusual co-operative breeding biology of the species means that the actual number of reproductive units is lower than that expected from the estimate of mature individuals (D. Wood in litt. 2016). Hence while the overall population may now be stable with the targeted recovery populations increasing (Department of Defense/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in litt. 2006, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2008, W. McDearman in litt. 2010), the structure of the population, documented local declines and the continued loss of some clusters suggest that the precautionary approach is to continue to suspect an on-going, slow overall decline. Its apparent recovery in many areas is the result of successful conservation efforts, including habitat management, nest-site provision and translocation of birds (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2008), whilst improved knowledge has been acquired owing to intensive studies. It is not clear if such management ceased, habitat improvements are yet sufficient enough to support continued population increases without the additional intensive management (J. R. Walters in litt. 2013).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe emphasis has been on site-specific management (J. A. Jackson in litt. 1999). Intensive activities include translocating young females from natal sites to groups lacking a female, constructing artificial cavities (Jackson 1994), and fitting restrictor plates to prevent D. pileatus enlarging cavities (Carter et al. 1989, Saenz et al. 1998, Wood et al. 2000). Adults have also been successfully translocated from sites that have been allowed to become isolated, and can augment the population in the receptor sites, but with lower success than for the translocation of young birds (Herbez et al. 2011, Cox and McCormick 2016). Habitat is managed (regular burning and understorey clearance) on some federal lands, but not always appropriately (Jackson 1994). Mechanical removal of the midstory and understory, which is substituting burning where fire is difficult to use, however lacks the additional ecological value of fires (D. Wood in litt. 2020). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service developed the Red-cockaded Woodpecker Foraging Matrix Application in 2004, which uses a habitat suitability modelling approach to assess the ability of sites to sustain populations via quantitative assessments of stand-level and territory-level habitat quality (McKellar et al. 2014). This has been used to assess potential impacts of projects that may affect foraging habitat, such as development, harvesting or modification (e.g. thinning of pine stands) (McKellar et al. 2014). In South Carolina the ""Safe Harbor"" scheme offers financial incentives to private landowners who undertake beneficial management prescriptions (Duncan et al. 2001, Smith et al. 2018). Local population increases have been dependent on intensive management (J. R. Walters in litt. 2013).Conservation Actions ProposedMonitor populations, especially where managed. Ensure co-ordination of management actions within subpopulations. Encourage long-term management through prescribed burning as the most effective method for maintaining suitable habitat in longleaf pine forests (Steen et al. 2013). Improve models used to assess impacts of projects affecting habitat by incorporating site specific information (McKellar et al. 2014). Continue to provide incentives for landowners to maintain/enhance habitat (Kennedy et al. 1996, Bonnie 1997). Fit restrictor plates only where cavities are scarce (Saenz et al. 1998). Document and monitor translocations (J. A. Jackson in litt. 1999). Replace even-aged forest management with selective or no cutting (J. A. Jackson in litt. 1999). Establish habitat corridors (e.g. along highways) (Jackson 1994).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Therefore, it is listed as Near Threatened.","This species occupies a variety of habitats generally associated with open areas and short vegetation (Yosef and International Shrike Working Group 2017). This includes parkland, pastures, open woodland, orchards and agricultural land with hedgerows and perching sites (such as fences) and impaling sites for storing food (e.g. barbed wire or vegetation with thorns/spines) (Yosef 1996, Yosef and International Shrike Working Group 2017). Shrike habitat typically includes four 'common elements': 1) foraging areas, typically bare ground and exposed rock, 2) nesting sites, usually small trees and shrubs, 3) perching sites, and 4) impaling sites, often barbed wire, thorns of sharp branches (Pruitt 2000, A. Chabot in litt. 2020). The species typically feeds on arthropods, amphibians, and small mammals, birds and reptiles, such as the Thamnophis sirtalis infernalis (Hughes 2019, Yosef 2020).","Several ideas have been presented that may account for declines in this species (see Lymn and Temple 1991), including pesticides (Anderson and Duzan 1978), fire ant presence in wintering habitats (Lymn and Temple 1991), West Nile Virus (Bertelsen et al. 2004, Smallwood and Nakomoto 2009) and habitat fragmentation and loss, particularly through conversion to agricultural land. The Loggerhead Shrike has been evidenced to be significantly more abundant in better connected areas of suitable habitat (Froehly et al. 2019) whilst occupancy significantly increases in areas with greater than 15-25% habitat suitability (A. Chabot in litt. 2020). Migratory connectivity is known to be greater in western L. ludovicianus populations where the impacts of habitat loss on populations are thought to be reduced, hence western populations may be at comparatively less risk than eastern populations (Chabot et al. 2018). Habitat loss and fragmentation are therefore thought to only be of regional significance, hence in other locations additional factors must be responsible for limiting Loggerhead Shrikes and driving the witnessed declines (Brooks and Temple 1990, Froehly et al. 2019). The species may have also been persecuted and shot in the past, but this has likely reduced (Yosef 1996). While the use of certain pesticides is now prohibited in U.S.A. the potential effects of other threats may be likely to continue into the future (Pruitt 2000, COSEWIC 2014). Collisions with vehicles contribute to the species's decline as roads display a number of essential habitat features; 29% of all L. ludovicianus winter mortality in Virginia has been attributed to collisions on roads (Blumton 1989). Furthermore, intraspecific competition on wintering grounds between migrants and resident shrikes that occupy territories year round likely contributes to the decline of obligant migrant populations of Loggerhead Shrike in north-eastern North America (Brooks and Temple 1990; Cade and Woods 1997; Pruitt 2000; COSEWIC 2000). Loss of habitat in wintering areas may exacerbate competition (Lymn and Temple 1991). Extreme local weather conditions have been implicated in declines as a result of high nest failure rates (e.g., nest abandonment or loss of young birds during cold wet breeding seasons, especially with heavy rains [Pruitt 2000]) and such threats may increase as stormy conditions are exacerbated under a changing global climate (COSEWIC 2014, Environment Canada 2015a). Predation of shrikes by a variety of species, including cats, raccoons, crows, magpies, and several raptors has been observed (Blumton 1989; Wiggins 2004) but the significance has not been evaluated. Predation by feral cats (Felis catus) impacts the endemic subspecies L. l. mearnsi on San Clemente Island, California, U.S.A. (Gustafson et al. 2020).","Partners in Flight (2019) estimate the population to total 7,000,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species is a widespread breeder across much of the U.S.A. and Mexico, extending into southern Canada in the breeding season. Northern populations are migratory whereas those in the south of the range are generally resident (Froehly et al. 2019).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe Loggerhead Shrike is protected in Canada, Mexico, and the USA under the Migratory Birds Convention Act (COSEWIC 2014). Under Canada’s Species at Risk Act, the Prairie subspecies (L. l. excubitorides) is currently listed as Threatened, while the Eastern subspecies (L. l. migrans) is listed as Endangered (COSEWIC 2014). The species was incorporated into the Canadian Wildlife Service's Operation Grasslands Community (Yosef 1996) whilst a targeted recovery strategy was developed and implemented in 2015 for subspecies migrans in Canada, aimed at re-establishing a viable population of the subspecies in Canada where less than 100 wild individuals remain (Environment Canada 2015a). This species has been successfully reared in captivity with captive-reared juveniles released to augment populations in Ontario and Quebec (as well as San Clemente Island, California); over 400 juveniles released between 2001-2010 with ~76% of such individuals thought to survive from release to migration initiation (Imlay et al. 2010, Nichols et al. 2010, Lagios et al. 2015). A species recovery plan also exists for subspecies excubitorides in Canada (Environment Canada 2015b) whilst the subspecies is included in multi-species action plans for southwestern Saskatchewan (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2017) and the Grasslands National Park (Parks Canada Agency 2016). The North American Loggerhead Shrike Working Group was established in 2013 to undertake 'multi-jurisdictional research and conservation efforts for Loggerhead Shrike and their habitat', guided by the Loggerhead Shrike Conservation Action Plan (Loggerhead Shrike Working Group 2017). Accomplishments so far include a tri-national colour banding program, predictive occupancy and distribution modelling, developing standardised protocols for shrike surveys and monitoring, and broad-scale surveys and monitoring through the community science program, 'Shrike Force' (Loggerhead Shrike Working Group 2017, J. Steiner in litt. 2020). Banding and radio-tagging is underway in Mexico to explore local movements and habitat utilisation (J. Steiner in litt. 2020). This species has been successfully reared in captivity with captive-reared juveniles released to augment populations on San Clemente Island, California and in Ontario, Canada (Imlay et al. 2010, Nichols et al. 2010, Lagios et al. 2015) and this action is considered significant in securing the long-term persistence and re-establishment of Loggerhead Shrike populations, particularly throughout the north-eastern portion of its range (L. Steiner in litt. 2020).Conservation Actions ProposedMonitor the species to get clear estimates of population size and trends across its range. Investigate any possible further threats to this species that could be contributing to population declines, including investigating whether other pesticides could be affecting the species and how the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on the species varies regionally (Environment Canada 2015a). Investigate the species's ecology, including work on its migration and its wintering locations, competition with other species and dietary requirements (see Yosef 1996, Environment Canada 2015a).

Between 2003-2008, the species underwent a rapid population reduction owing to mortality caused by West Nile Virus and whilst declines have slowed, they are still occurring at a sufficient rate to meet the threshold for listing as Vulnerable.","This species inhabits oak savanna, with large trees scattered among broad expanses of open grassland and pasture (del Hoyo et al. 2009, Marzluff and Sharpe 2018). Over recent decades, it has been increasing in suburban settings, notably in the Sacramento Valley. It forages in cultivated fields and orchards. This omnivorous species feeds on a range of items, including invertebrates, small mammals, bird eggs and nestlings, carrion, food discarded by humans, grains, fruits, nuts and other seeds. Nest-building takes place from December through to March, with egg-laying from March to May (del Hoyo et al. 2009).","Habitat loss through urban and agricultural developments, as well as the impacts of Sudden Oak Death, summer droughts and poisons used to kill ground squirrels were thought to be potential threats to the species (see Marzluff and Sharpe 2018). These may have caused minor local declines, but the species was still abundant in other areas (Marzluff and Sharpe 2018), such that these threats were thought to have no/negligible impacts on the species as a whole and the population was deemed to be stable, although Airola et al. (2007) suggest the species may have even increased between 1980/81 and 2001/02. However, since the mid-2000s the population has been in very rapid decline as West Nile Virus (WNV) sweeps through the population and it is thought to have suffered the largest, range-wide impact from WNV of any bird species (Kilpatrick and Wheeler 2019). It was first noted in 2003 (Reisen et al. 2004) and although there was suggestions of a potential recovery after 2007-08 (W. Koenig et al. 2012), recent evidence concludes that the species is continuing to decline, possibly due to the species's limited range and the fact that WNV transmission has occurred throughout its range in every year since 2004, despite the peak of the outbreak being a number of years ago (Kilpatrick and Wheeler 2019).","Partners in Flight (2020) currently estimate the population of Pica nutalli to total 400,000 mature individuals, with the population continuing to decline following the severe impacts of the West Nile Virus.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to California, USA, occurring west of the Sierra Nevada mountains (del Hoyo et al. 2009, Marzluff and Sharpe 2018).

Many birds spend their entire lives in their natal flocks, and individuals that do disperse (mostly young females) generally travel short distances. Dispersal habits are affected by changes in local habitat, and by fluctuating operational sex ratios within and among flocks (R. Benford in litt. 2012). Although omnivorous, it has a mutualist relationship with the pinyon pine complex of western North America, dispersing the large wingless seeds long distances and reaping the reward of an energy and nutrient rich food source (Johnson et al. 2016). Individuals have excellent spatial memories, giving them uncanny recovery accuracy when digging up food stores months after caching, even through snow. It is one of the earliest nesting passerines in the U.S.A., commencing breeding in the winter in areas where the pine-seed crop was abundant the previous autumn. One population in New Mexico breeds in autumn when pinyon pine cone crops are available (Balda 2002).","The major threat to this species may have been the destruction of its major habitat type, piñon-juniper woodland; ongoing forest loss within the species's range is currently estimated at ~5.6% per three generations (Tracewski et al. 2016). Land managers have followed a policy to eradicate this woodland, with the U.S. Forest Service classifying it as ""non-commercial"" and placing it in a ""no-value"" category. During the 1940s-1960s, major programmes to eradicate the entire habitat were carried out, during which possibly millions of G. cyanocephalus died owing to habitat destruction. Piñon-juniper woodland is also often removed to create or promote shrublands for the benefit of sage-grouse, a species targeted for conservation efforts, despite its rates of decline being slower than those of G. cyanocephalus, which declines as a result (Boone et al. 2018). Currently herbicides, mechanical ploughing and fire are used to turn piñon-juniper woodland into pasture land for cattle. Fire-suppression policies in south-west U.S.A. have led to huge, uncontrolled wildfires that consumed large areas of suitable habitat in the late 1990s (Balda 2002). Additional management actions also pose a potential threat to Pinyon Jays, particularly heavy woodland thinning (Johnson et al. 2018, Magee et al. 2019, Johnson et al. 2020). A ""catastrophic"" drought in the early 2000s also caused considerable mortality (Benford 2008). Drought events can lead to water stress and increase susceptibility to pinyon engraver beetles (Wiggins 2005). The decline of pinyon pine and associated encroachment of juniper associated with global warming are primary factors restricting habitat and limiting reproductive success (R. Benford in litt. 2012). However, there has also been the suggestion that it may be a decline in the woodland/shrubland transitional areas and habitat quality which may have been even more important in the continued decline of this species (E. Ammon and J. Boone in litt. 2016). Further threats include noise and habitat fragmentation from oil and gas activities (Kleist et al. 2018, Johnson et al. 2020).","Partners in Flight (2019) place the population size at 770,000 mature individuals, although Johnson et al. (2020) suggest this figure may be an overestimate due to estimates being outdated and based on the scant, available survey data, particularly in New Mexico where 29% of the global population is thought to reside. The number of mature individuals is therefore placed in the band 500,000-999,999 mature individuals to accommodate such uncertainty.",Decreasing,"Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus is a permanent resident of the foothills and lower mountain slopes of the western and south-western U.S.A. and northern Baja California, Mexico. In the U.S.A., it is found from central Oregon east to western South Dakota and south to central New Mexico and extreme western Oklahoma. Recent records also place the species at Sonora (Russell and Monson 1998), Gómez Farías (Chávez et al. 2018) and near Sierra San Luis, Chihuahua, Mexico (Moreno-Contreras et al. 2016). In years when pine crops fail it becomes irruptive, with individuals often dispersing far outside their normal range (Madge and Burn 1993, Balda 2002). Thought to be owing mainly to habitat degradation/and loss, this species is estimated to have suffered a significant population decline.","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayNo new policies are in place, whilst old ones are no longer implemented (Balda 2002). A series of conservation recommendations and goals were recently published in the New Mexico Bird Conservation Plan, written by the New Mexico Avian Conservation Partners (NMACP), in order to mitigate the species ongoing decline; such recommendations focus predominantly on the preservation and management of piñon-juniper woodlands (Johnson et al. 2020).Conservation Actions ProposedIdentify suitable areas of piñon-juniper habitat for protection. Promote suitable land-management practices. Encourage land-owners to take advantage of funding opportunities to create, restore and maintain suitable habitat on their land. Reclassify high-quality, contiguous patches of pinyon juniper woodland and complex woodland/shrubland matrices as ecologically valuable and protected; most Pinyon Jay habitat is on public land, and management plans focused on preserving this forest are essential (Benford 2008, J. Boone in litt. 2016). Further investigate causes on ongoing declines (J.

Ground cover is sparse with bare sand patches for foraging and acorn-caching. It rarely uses scrub with more than 15% pine cover. Habitat structure and composition are maintained by frequent fires, and optimal habitat occurs 5-15 years post-fire. Fire frequency for coastal scrub should be greater than that for inland scrub as open sandy areas do not persist in coastal areas for more than a few years (D. Breininger in litt. 2012). It is permanently territorial, with habitat fragmentation decreasing territory size and resulting in increased predation and reduced reproductive success (USFWS 2019). Dispersal is inhibited by more than 8 km of open, non-scrub habitat or 1 km of forest. First brood eggs are laid from March-June, and true second brood attempts are rare. Some nests benefit from helpers, which increase reproductive success (Franzreb 2007). Nests typically occur 1-2 m above the ground in shrubby oaks, and contain clutch sizes of between 1-5 (typically 3-4) eggs (USFWS 2019). It feeds mainly on arthropods, acorns and small vertebrates (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996, G. E. Woolfenden in litt. 1998, USFWS 2019).","Fire suppression in remaining habitat has been identified as a major continuing threat because it causes scrub to overgrow and pine density to increase, rendering habitat unsuitable. Declines on lands specifically protected for the species are largely the result of reduced habitat quality, caused by disrupted fire regimes (Breininger et al. 1999, 2006, 2009, 2010); suitable Florida Scrub-Jay habitat is thought to have declined by 22% between 1999-2012 (USFWS 2019). In addition, extensive habitat fragmentation has led to a high degree of genetic differentiation (Coulon et al. 2008) and additional land protection to increase connectivity within existing genetic units is likely necessary to prevent further fragmentation and loss of genetic diversity (Coulon et al. 2010, 2012). Reduced immigration into one of the largest remaining populations at Archbold Biological Station has resulted in increased levels of inbreeding and decreased fitness via inbreeding depression, emphasizing the importance of maintaining population connectivity (Chen et al. 2016 ). At Archbold, there is evidence of inbreeding depression at multiple life stages, including hatching failure, juvenile survival, and breeder lifespan (Chen  et al. 2016). Housing developments and citrus-groves have replaced much suitable habitat (G. E. Woolfenden in litt. 1998). The rate of development in Florida has increased markedly since the 1960s as the human population almost doubled between 1960 and 1980 (Cox 1987). Direct human disturbance and feral cats affect the increasing number of territories adjacent to housing (Cox 1987), which can have the knock-on impact of reduced nesting success in suburban areas (see Niederhauser and Bowman 2014), and these individuals can also have reduced egg viability too (see Aldredge et al. 2012). Birds in roadside territories are frequently killed by vehicles (Dreschel et al. 1990, Mumme et al. 2000). Several species of snake, bird and mammal are native predators (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996). Nocturnal predators, including yellow rat snakes Elaphe obsoleta, are a particular threat since breeding birds do not appear to be vigilant to, or defend against, nocturnal predators and brooding females are also at risk from being killed (Carter et al. 2007). Hatching failure has been linked to below-average rainfall during the breeding season (Wilcoxen et al. 2011) and so droughts are likely to pose a threat to the species. The recent spread of West Nile virus to Florida may pose a threat to the species (Chu et al. 2003). An observation of nest-predation by invasive fire ants Solenopsis invicta was reported in south-central Florida in 2009 (Wilcoxen and Rensel 2009) and may be a threat to the reproductive success of the species. Climate change may pose a threat to the species through both increased drought and hurricane frequency and intensity, and sea level rise (USFWS 2019).","The breeding population was 4,000 pairs in 1993 (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996, G. E. Woolfenden in litt. 1998), but has declined by &gt;25% since then (Boughton and Bowman 2011) and is now estimated at c.3,000 family groups (R. Bowman in litt. 2012). In many areas, average group size is below three, thus the global population is suspected to be 6,000-9,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 4,000-6,000 mature individuals. Partners in Flight (2019) however, currently estimate the population to total 7,500 mature individuals, therefore the population is placed here in the band 2,500-9,999 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Aphelocoma coerulescens was known from scattered localities in 39 of 40 peninsula counties in Florida, U.S.A., but has declined since the mid-19th century and most rapidly since 1950. Populations are now considered to have declined to less than 10% of pre-European settlement numbers (Boughton and Bowman 2011) and the species is now possibly removed from 13 of its original 39 counties (USFWS 2019). The current range is local and fragmented from Flagler, Marion and Levy counties to Collier, Glades and Palm Beach. The breeding population was 4,000 pairs in 1993, but has continued to decline by &gt;25% since then (Boughton and Bowman 2011) and is now estimated at c.3,000 family groups (Boughton and Bowman 2011, R. Bowman in litt. 2012). In many areas, average group size is below three, and this could be having an impact on breeding success, as the presence of nest helpers can be the most important factor in nest-survival analyses (e.g. Niederhauser and Bowman 2014).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species has been studied since 1969 and this continues, especially at and near the Archbold Biological Station (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996, G. E. Woolfenden in litt. 1998). A long-term study at Kennedy Space Center has been running for &gt;20 years, focusing on linking demography to habitat management decision making (e.g. Breininger et al. 2009). A species recovery plan was published in 1990 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1990) and the species is included in the Multi-Species Recovery Plan for South Florida (1999). There are now 12 populations of colour-banded jays that are monitored (R. Bowman in litt. 2003, USFWS 2019). Habitat management by burning is still too site-specific (R. Bowman in litt. 2003). Supplementary feeding at Archbold Biological Station in south-central Florida from 2000 to 2007 resulted in a marked improvement of reproductive output (Schoech et al. 2008), which has potential impacts for local populations as well as potential translocated populations. A lot of habitat that is important for this species has been put into conservation lands although much of this is fragmented (K. Bibb and T. Mecklenborg in litt. 2016). Currently there are 139,716 ha of conserved land, which equates to ~78% of potential remaining scrub habitat in peninsular Florida (USFWS 2019). Translocation efforts are currently underway in an attempt to rescue a small coastal population (N. Chen et al. 2020); 121 individuals had been translocated to conservation lands by 2015 (USFWS 2019). Education and outreach projects have increased interest in the Florida Scrub-Jay and promoted understanding of the management actions required to promote their long-term persistence (USFWS 2019).Conservation Actions ProposedMonitor the population (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996, G. E. Woolfenden in litt. 1998). Regularly determine the extent of habitat (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996, G. E. Woolfenden in litt. 1998). Research the causes of variation in birth rates, death rates, and spatial/temporal movement patterns, in both natural and human-modified habitats (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996, G. E. Woolfenden in litt. 1998). Maintain long-term ecological studies (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996, G. E. Woolfenden in litt. 1998, Breininger et al. 2009). Acquire and actively manage a protected-area network (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996, G. E. Woolfenden in litt. 1998). Improvements in controlled fire management are needed to improve habitat quality so that populations don’t continue to decline (D. Breininger in litt. 2016); this might include burning patches of habitat based on habitat states and predicted trajectories (Woolfenden and Fitzpatrick 1996, G. E. Woolfenden in litt. 1998, Breininger et al. 2010, 2014). Translocations of individuals in areas most at risk from habitat destruction could be used to supplement other populations (D.

It also occurs locally in towns and around human habitation, where it nests in artificial cavities and other human structures (Allen 1996). It tends to feed in open areas such as clearings in woodland, marshes, fields and along coastlines (Turner and Rose 1989). Breeding takes place in April-July (Turner and Rose 1989, Allen 1996). Movements are poorly known, but some birds undertake small-scale migrations during winter.","Logging of pines in the northern Bahamas has probably had a major impact (Smith and Smith 1989). Logging was terminated in the early 1970s, but much of the secondary forest is now approaching maturity and there are opportunities for renewed logging (Allen 1996); forest loss within the species's range is currently estimated at ~1.6% across the stipulated ten years (Tracewski et al. 2016). Planned housing developments could eliminate 8% of remaining breeding habitat (Allen 1996) and there is potential for considerable future building developments on Grand Bahama (L. Gape in litt. 2009), though in recent decades habitat loss has been modest (J. Lloyd in litt. 2009). There is competition for nest-sites with introduced cavity-nesters such as House Sparrow Passer domesticus and European Starling Sturnus vulgaris (Allen 1996). The small area of remaining habitat exacerbates the risk of hurricane-induced habitat loss (Allen 1996); the only notable habitat loss in recent years has resulted from saltwater intrusion associated with large storm surges following hurricanes in 2004 (J. Lloyd in litt. 2009). The frequency of hurricanes within the species's range may increase in coming years as a consequence of global climate change. Fire management may be important for the species as fire suppression may render areas of forest unsuitable over time (J. Lloyd in litt. 2009).","Smith and Smith (1989) previously estimated a global population of 2,400 pairs (4,800 mature individuals). Anecdotal evidence suggests that the population has declined substantially since then and available survey data suggests the species occurs at low densities, even in apparently suitable habitat (Lloyd and Slater 2011); consequently we cautiously assume a population of 1,000-2,499 mature individuals.

The winter distribution is poorly defined, but there are a number of records from the southern Bahamas and eastern Cuba, and small numbers appear to be resident on the breeding islands (A.

Throughout its range, breeders favour relatively open grassland, shrubland or woodland with scattered shrubs or trees; it is not found in dense vegetation. It forages primarily on the ground, probing for insects and other arthropods, but will also eat seeds and berries (England and Laudenslayer 1993). It also digs with its bill, but less frequently, not as powerfully nor as efficiently as other thrashers (England and Laudenslayer 1993). In the Mojave desert, California, migration begins as soon as breeding finishes, with breeding grounds vacated by late August (Brewer and MacKay 2001).","Populations have been eliminated by dense urbanisation around Tucson and by large scale agriculture along the Gila River. In California potential threats may include harvesting of Joshua trees and other yuccas, overgrazing and off-road vehicle activity. However, there have been suggestions that clearing and agricultural activities actually favour this species (England and Laudenslayer 1993). Competition with the Curve-billed Thrasher Toxostroma curvirostre for a depleted food supply may have contributed to a decline in the population. Breeding is delayed and potentially less successful as a result of drought conditions (McCreedy and van Ripper III 2015), which may increase in line with climate change, and thus this could be a significant threat into the future. Energy/resource extraction is also listed in Rosenberg et al.

It is also found occasionally in open habitats with dense grasses and forbs. Nest site selection can vary according to the region, with individuals in the Coastal Plain area selecting areas with a greater amount of woody vegetation and lower grass densities, and individuals in the Sandhills region selecting sites with intermediate grass density and higher tree basal area (Winiarski et al. 2017b).","The species is now absent over most of its northern range and uncommon in most of the southern part because of timber harvesting practices, fire suppression and fragmentation of suitable habitat, meaning many suitable patches of habitat are not occupied (Jones et al. 2017). It is also subject to disturbance by birdwatchers in parts of its range. Urban development in certain areas may also have an effect, as this will only exacerbate the problem of restoring and implementing fire regimes that are beneficial for this species (P. Taillie in litt. 2016).

Occasional birds are reported north to south-central Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee, and it formerly occurred as far north as south-west Pennsylvania, south Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. Only the northern populations were migratory, reaching as far as North Carolina. In 1890-1915, its range expanded considerably in response to the clearance of old pine forests and the abandonment of farms in the Mid-west. This expansion peaked in 1915-1920, and a gradual decline in the north of its range began in the 1930s, mostly occurring before the 1960s, because of forest succession; P. aestivalis now only appears present at 11% of historic locations in North Carolina (Taillie et al. 2016). Maximum densities of singing males in South Carolina were 0.41-0.48/ha in occupied patches of suitable habitat, but many populations are isolated and prone to local extinction (Dunning 1993, J. B. Dunning and C. E.

Carpenter in litt. 2020), there is now evidence to suggest this may not be the case. Efforts to restore understorey plant communities in pine flatwoods have proven difficult so far, and as such, little suitable habitat has been restored. However, prescribed burning has been identified as a more cost-effective method of maintaining proper understorey and grass communities than mechanical or chemical control of vegetation and the species's is known to show clear selection for several vegetation characteristics linked to frequent fire in its resident longleaf pine forest habitat (Winiarski et al. 2017a). Furthermore, timber management changes since 2000 within the species's range may provide more habitat in the future. Managing for large trees (sawtimber) is becoming increasingly viable for forest land-owners as opposed to pulpwood; in managing for sawtimber, planting densities are reduced and stand improvement activities maintain grass understorey better than pulpwood plantations (Askins et al. 2007).Conservation Actions ProposedRestore habitat, reinstating a natural fire regime and promoting habitat contiguity (P. Taillie in litt. 2016). Undertake further restoration via canopy reduction to significantly increase P. aestivalis habitat availability, and ensure both increased patch size and reduced patch isolation (Pickens et al. 2017).

Meadowlarks are vulnerable to predation from mid-sized predators and snakes. Survival of fledglings is low the first week of fledgling due to immobility of young, increasing vulnerability to snake predation (Kershner et al. 2004). Additionally, pesticide use may be leading to species mortality as both breeding females and post-fledgling juveniles have been observed to use fields treated with agricultural chemicals (Kershner 2001).

Encourage appropriate land-use practices to provide suitable nesting habitat. This can include appropriate mowing regimes, which may enhance habitat quality, but such actions should be delayed until Aug to avoid causing nesting failure (see Jaster et al. 2012). Patch-burn grazing may also prove effective in removing woody vegetation and providing suitable grassland habitat (Hovick and Miller 2016). Conduct research to allow for quantification of trends outside of North America.

It winters primarily in wooded wetlands and is not strongly associated with open agricultural habitats. Large flocks have been known to gather in suburban areas during wintering periods (Newell Wohner et al. 2018).","The reasons behind current trends are poorly understood but several threats are suspected to be causing the declines.

Strip-mining for tar sands is expected to increase in the future, with up to 300,000 ha of Canada's boreal forest and wetland predicted to be directly affected over the next 30 to 50 years (Wells et al. 2008). Other possible threats include boreal wetland drying and chemical change resulting from global climate change (Matsuoka et al. 2010, McClure et al. 2012), depletion of available calcium resulting from acid precipitation (Greenberg and Droege 1999, Greenberg et al. 2011), increase in methyl mercury (Greenberg et al. 2011, Edmonds et al. 2012), disease (Barnard et al. 2010), loss of boreal forest habitat due to hydropower development (S. Luepold in litt. 2016), loss of wooded wetlands in the south-east U.S. winter range (Hamel et al. 2009, Greenberg et al. 2011), and mortality associated with past and ongoing blackbird control efforts (Greenberg et al. 2011). Recent research suggests that an ecological trap created through timber harvesting and clear-cutting on breeding grounds may be responsible for declines, possibly through increased Red squirrel (Tamiascirius hudsonicus) nest predation, however evidence of such a trap is largely lacking (Buckley Luepold et al. 2015). Forest loss within the species's range is currently estimated at ~5.4% across the stipulated ten year period (Tracewski et al. 2016). Potential low level mortality may also result from collisions with communication towers (Longcore et al. 2013).","The population is estimated to number anywhere between 0.2-2 million individuals (R.

Like the closely-related V. cyanoptera and V. chrysoptera it may have been a bird of gaps, edges, and early-mid successional habitats within the forest mosaic (although bachmanii had more of a preference for forest canopy), and it apparently did not require primeval swamp forest: the last documented breeding site had previously been a rice field some decades before (Pulliam 2010). Winter habitat requirements were much less specific, with records from dry forest, wetlands and urban areas (Hamel 1995), but apparently favouring wooded areas with flowering Hibiscus trees (Curson et al. 1994).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","This species breeds on freshwater lakes, pools and rivers in open or wooded country. It can be seen nesting as high as 3,000 m in the Rocky Mountains (U.S.A.). The species uses relatively productive lakes and rivers in Iceland. It is a hole-nesting species using natural holes in lava fields and nest boxes erected on farmhouses at the edge of the breeding area (Tucker and Heath 1994). Laying is usually from mid-May although slightly earlier if using nest boxes. It lays 6 to 12 eggs (Eadie et al. 2020). It feeds mainly on benthic invertebrates (Tucker and Heath 1994). Wintering usually takes place on marine habitats (such as bays, harbors, fjords, inlets with rocky shores or mussel beds, creeks, waterfalls, or even storm drains; Eadie et al. 2020). Summer foods include insects and their larvae and plant material, whereas winter diet consists mainly of molluscs and crustaceans (del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species is not truly migratory, with some populations mostly sedentary, e.g. Iceland, and others moving distances of &gt;1,000 km (Eadie et al. 2020).","Hunting occurs on both coasts of North America and eggs are collected in Iceland, but harvest is subject to quotas set to minimise any population impact (Eadie et al. 2000, 2020), hence the present level of hunting is thought to be sustainable for the Icelandic and US west coast populations, but could potentially have a larger impact on the much smaller population on the US east coast (Eadie et al. 2000). Similarly in Canada, annual harvests across five eastern provinces (Atlantic Canada and Quebec) have shown that less than 1,000 individuals are shot per year, with less than 5,000 birds shot by the Pacific Flyway sport harvest (from Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington State), and 3,000 birds harvested in Alaska; hunting pressure is thus considered relatively low (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2020). Agro-industry plantations have contributed to habitat restrictions due to the loss or degradation of old forest featuring dead trees and large trees with dead limbs, which make for suitable nest cavities. The decrease in available nesting sites may have caused increased chick mortality due to greater distances separating nest holes from water (Eadie et al. 2000, Environment Canada 2013). Oil spills may pose a serious risk both through direct mortality from oiling and longer-term effects of chronic contamination pollution. In particular, the species may be exposed to pollutants when aggregating in wintering grounds which overlap with industrialised seaways such as the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Vancouver, Kittimat and Alice Arm and Baie-Comeau (Eadie et al. 2000). The species is also at risk from contamination of food resources, in particular blue mussels, which is a preferred prey item (Eadie et al. 2000). In Europe, the species is mainly confined to a small area in northeastern Iceland, with 85-90% of the national population occurring at Lake Mývatn and the River Laxá. Such a locally concentrated distribution makes the European population vulnerable to stochastic events, and the 1989 crash in food resources led to a halving of the Icelandic populations (Kear 2005). The planned introduction of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar into the river systems and sediment dredging in Lake Mývatn (Einarsson and Magnúsdóttir 1993) could have negative effects on future food availability through altered trophic dynamics in the ecosystem (Kear 2005). The Mountain Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) infestation and forest fires have additionally destroyed many mature forests in the Central British Columbia area (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2020). Recreational sport fishing, boats, and altering aquatic habitats may also reduce food availability and conflict between neighboring bird territories as the species attempts to flee disturbance (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2020).","The European population is estimated at 800-900 pairs, which equates to 1,600-1,800 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015); however Europe represents &lt;5% of the global range. Latest wintering surveys in 2017 recorded 7,700 individuals in the eastern Canadian population (with 80% of this population found on the St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf), with a further 500 individuals wintering in the Maritime provinces and 100 individuals in Maine (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2020). The western Canadian population has recently been estimated at 260,000 individuals, with 18,300 individuals present in the Central Interior Plateau Region (observed in 2019; Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2020). The recent Partners in Flight (2019) reassessment estimates the North American population size to be 180,000 mature individuals. The Alaskan population is unknown, as surveys will usually combine Barrow's and Common Goldeneyes Bucephala clangula when counting (J-P. Savard in litt. 2020). The overall population is therefore tentatively placed in the band 175,000-200,000 mature individuals, roughly equating to 260,000-300,000 individuals, though this number requires confirmation.",Stable,"The major breeding range of this species is along the western coast of the U.S.A. from southern Alaska to northern California. Breeding colonies are also found in Labrador (Canada), south-west Greenland (to Denmark) and Iceland. The population in Greenland is likely now extirpated (Eadie et al. 2020). Some populations (e.g. Iceland) are sedentary (primary breeding taking place in the Mývatn area; Pearce et al. 2014), whereas others undertake longer trips to winter along the Pacific coast of Alaska and Canada, and the north-eastern coast of North America (del Hoyo et al. 1992). Thus, it is thought to exist in four distinct populations (Iceland, North America, Alaska, and the Pacific Coast (Pearce et al. 2014, J-P. Savard in litt. 2020).

Research studies into the causes of the population sexual imbalance should be developed.

Thus the species is listed here as Near Threatened, but future surveys could show that the species is declining at an even greater rate.","This species breeds on small lakes, pools, bogs and streams of the tundra. It mainly feeds on molluscs but will also take crustaceans, with a more varied diet in summer including insects, arachnids, berries and seeds. It feeds by diving, and will pluck or dabble on the surface. Breeding begins in May or June in single pairs or loose groups (del Hoyo et al. 1992).","Climate change potentially represents the greatest threat to the species. Warming and sea ice retreat poses an ongoing and future threat to the species’ habitat as sea ice provides an important resting platform when not foraging (Lovvorn et al. 2009). Reductions in ice habitat are predicted to result in large decreases in the area of viable habitat, even in the absence of other impacts such as shifts in food availability (Lovvorn et al. 2009).  Such habitat shifts have been seen in almost one third of winters between 1998 and 2011, denying access to preferred foraging locations and forcing prey switching, resulting in adult body fat being one third lower than in winters with access to these resources (Lovvorn et al. 2014). A recent modelling study by Christie et al. (2018) reveals that under an RCP 8.5 scenario, the species's abundance will likely increase through to 2040 before declining rapidly through to near extirpation in the late 21st century as the Bering Sea becomes ice-free. There appears to be no difference in mean survival between widely separated breeding areas, indicating that survival is mainly a function of wintering conditions (Solovyeva et al. 2017). Wetlands provide important breeding grounds for the species, and remote sensing and imaging has shown shrinkage and disappearance of lakes and ponds in Alaska and Siberia (Smith et al. 2005, Riordan et al. 2006), while the alteration of habitats through coastal erosion, inundation and salinization from storm surges, thawing permafrost, and sedimentation changes due to sea level rise and increased river discharge could change the suitability of current nesting areas (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). However, no link between wetland loss and population decline has been made for this species yet. Nevertheless, climate change is predicted to cause dramatic habitat changes in the Arctic region, with unknown impacts on the long-term survival of the species (Fox et al. 2015). Climate change has also been held responsible for severely reducing the Eiders’ benthic prey, likely due to ocean acidification (e.g. molluscs which form a large part of Eider diet) (Steinacher et al. 2009, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010, Carboneras and Kirwan 2017); Macoma calcarea, a key prey of the Spectacled Eider, is evidenced to be decreasing in abundance throughout sites in the Bering Sea, influencing the Eider's winter foraging (Goethel et al. 2018).  Direct persecution poses another major threat to the species, with 10s to 100s of individuals harvested in Alaska and 10,000-14,000 in Russia per annum (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). This represents around 5% annual mortality, based on a population of 330,000 (Carboneras and Kirwan 2017). Pollution also threatens this species with lethal and sub-lethal levels of lead poisoning from ingested lead shot found in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta breeding population, with levels high enough to influence regional subpopulation dynamics (Flint et al. 2016, Sea Duck Joint Venture 2016). Exposure to lead reduced estimated survival from 0.78 to 0.44 (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010), while the survival of females exposed to lead was 0.34 lower than that of those with blood lead levels at or below background levels (Grand et al. 1998). Lead levels exceeding typical exposure thresholds were found in 30.7% of females in the Chaun Delta, Russia between 2003-2010; however, only 8.8% exhibited levels above the critical threshold (D. Solovyeva in litt. 2012, 2020). Lead shot is likely not a serious threat to Siberian populations due to the low human density in the breeding range (D. Solovyeva in litt. 2020). Oil spills occur in the species range, and although infrequent, represent a significant risk to the population (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). Oil and gas development on the central coast of Alaska's Arctic Coastal Plain has altered nesting habitat, causing potential threats from oil contamination, off-road vehicle use, wetland filling as well as the indirect effects of human disturbance (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). However, the development related to the petroleum industry is not regarded a significant threat to the species as only a small proportion of the species’s range is within or near developed areas. The risk to eiders from collisions and disturbance resulting from industrial activities and interaction with shipping lanes linked to oil and gas development is thought to be low and is unlikely to have population-level effects (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2010). The species is susceptible to avian influenza, but at present, the disease appears not to have any significant effects on the population. Seroprevalence of avian influenza in Spectacled Eider is approximately 90% (Wilson et al. 2013), but less than 5% tested positive for the virus (Ip et al. 2008). Arctic Foxes Vulpes lagopus are present in the species’s range and may contribute to mortality through predation. Density of wolverine and now brown bear appear to have increased in low Arctic tundra as a result of climate change impacts (Solovyeva 2016). Modelling of breeding success indicates that predation is likely to be driving reductions in productivity, although factors operating over winter are likely to be the main drivers of observed declines across the range (Solovyeva et al. 2017a). Changes in the species community composition may be also having an effect, with a decline in Sabine’s Gull Xema sabini and Arctic Tern Sterna paradise (which provide nest protection) and an increase in mammalian predators and Vega Gull Larus smithsonianus vegae potentially leading to reduced breeding success (see Solovyeva and Zelenskaya 2016, Solovyeva et al. 2017b). It is possible that these community changes are a result of climate change (D. Solovyeva in litt. 2018).","Wetlands International (2020) estimate the global population to number 360,000-400,000 individuals, in line with the 2010 estimate based on aerial surveys of winter flocks in the Bering Sea of 369,122 individuals, rounded here to 370,000 individuals (Larned et al. 2012). This equates to 246,081 mature individuals, rounded here to 250,000 mature individuals, as estimated by Partners in Flight (2019).",Decreasing,"This species breeds along the coasts of north-east Siberia, Russia, east from the Yana Delta to Cape Schmidt, and also along the Beaufort Sea coast of Alaska's North Slope and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, USA. 90% of the breeding population is thought to inhabit the Russian range with just 5% of the population residing in the northern Alaskan and Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta ranges respectively (Goldman et al. 2017).

Martin in litt. 2018).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue regular monitoring of the winter population, as this is the easiest way to monitor overall trends.

It is therefore listed as Endangered.,"Ammospiza caudacuta is found in tidal coastal marshes where there is dense cordgrass, blackgrass or saltmeadow grass. Home ranges preferentially include Spartina patens and Juncus gerardii cover (Shriver et al. 2010), and nesting success is positively correlated with the presence of the latter (Gjerdrum et al. 2008). Nesting takes place from mid May through to early September and males sing occasionally (C. Elphick in litt. 2012, K. O'Brien in litt. 2020) during this time. Nests are placed 6-15 cm above the ground and usually 3-5 greenish white to greenish blue eggs, speckled with reddish brown, are laid. They are not territorial and are not usually found in mixed species groups or flocks (Rising 1996), apart from with other tidal marsh sparrows during non-breeding periods (J. S. Greenlaw in litt. 2012, C. Elphick in litt. 2016, Greenlaw et al. 2020).","Localised populations have suffered throughout its range from the historical loss and fragmentation of marshes owing to urban development (Greenlaw and Rising 1994, Sibley 1996, C. Elphick in litt. 2003, 2012). Recent population declines are associated with the presence and number of downstream tidal restrictions (levees, roads, train tracks, etc.) that alter natural flow of tide waters in and out of marshes, although the mechanism behind this link is not well known (Correll et al. 2017). Further on-going threats include increased tidal flooding (e.g., due to sea level rise and increased storm surge frequency/magnitude), hybridization with Nelson’s Sparrows A. nelsoni (which may reduce fitness and limit the number of pure Saltmarsh Sparrow populations), degradation from chemical spills and other pollutants, and invasive species (particularly Phragmites, which makes the habitat completely unsuitable) (C. Elphick in litt. 2016). Predation also presents another notable threat to the species. Whilst the identity and relative impact of the primary predators is uncertain, predation is known to dramatically reduce nest and juvenile survival throughout the species's range, particularly in the southern portion (Roberts et al. 2017).This species appears to be extremely vulnerable to a slight rise in sea-level, as nests are lost due to flooding (Bayard and Elphick 2011, Shriver et al. 2016, Field et al. 2017a). To date the species has not been recorded nesting outside of high marsh habitats; the implications of sea-level rise and loss of high marsh habitats are therefore extremely serious, with the potential for the species to go extinct in the near future (see Field et al. 2017a); already-low vitality rates, largely attributable to the impact of predation throughout the southern portions of this species's range, are also thought to be generating localised extinctions in the immediate future (Roberts et al. 2019). The amount by which sea level will rise owing to climate change remains uncertain but Spartina patens dominated marsh (high marsh) may disappear or be greatly reduced in size as the large amount of development along the coast means that there is limited scope for marshes to migrate inland; and vegetation within marshes is already changing in a manner that suggests marshes are getting wetter (Field et al. 2016). High precipitation during the breeding season is also known to be negatively associated with population growth in Saltmarsh Sparrow populations (Shriver et al. 2016) and given the increased frequency and intensity of rainfall and storm events being witnessed throughout the species's range, this will likely drive further ongoing population declines in the future (K. O'Brien in litt. 2020).","Recent population estimates suggest that the species may number 53,000 (37,000-69,000) individuals in the breeding range (Wiest et al. 2016). This population estimate was conducted to largely capture the breeding population (C. Elphick in litt. 2017) and so this may actually equate to the number of mature individuals. Whilst this species was previously thought to adopt a 60:40 sex ratio, recent findings found that this is likely a result of interannual variation and when measured across multiple years, the sex ratio is confirmed to be ~1:1 (Benvenuti et al. 2018). As a result, the population is placed in the band 37,000-69,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Ammospiza caudacuta is confined to a narrow Atlantic coastal strip of the U.S.A. from Maine southwards to the Delmarva Peninsula, with a southward shift in winter as far as Florida and north to Maryland and Massachusetts (Greenlaw and Woolfenden 2007, J. S. Greenlaw in litt. 2012). It is common to abundant in saltmarshes in the core of its range (J. S. Greenlaw in litt. 2012) and has been estimated to number c.250,000 individuals (Rich et al. 2003, P. Comins in litt. 2003); more recent estimates suggest that the species may number 53,000 (37,000-69,000) individuals in the breeding range (Wiest et al. 2016). Its highly fragmented range is c.20,000 km2, within which it occupies an area of less than 2,000 km2 of appropriate habitat (P. Comins in litt. 2003, C. Elphick in litt. 2003).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe Saltmarsh Habitat and Avian Research Program (SHARP) and their partners have conducted a number of recent studies to assess the species’ status.  These include a range-wide population survey (Wiest et al. 2016) and trend assessment (Correll et al. 2017), demographic studies (e.g. Field et al. 2017a,b), studies of changing habitat conditions (Field et al. 2016), as well as studies on many other aspects of the species’ biology. The species occurs within a number of protected areas supporting coastal habitat, and restoration of tidal marshes is on-going (C. Elphick in litt. 2012). Past efforts to restore tidal flow to marshes appear not to have benefitted saltmarsh sparrow (Elphick et al. 2015). Over the past few years, saltmarsh sparrows have become more central to coastal marsh planning within the species’ range and SHARP has begun investigating the effects of coastal management activities on the species (C. Elphick et al. in litt. 2016). This work includes investigations of potential methods to increase habitat area (including facilitation of marsh migration into upland habitats and creation of floating habitat structures) and systematic evaluation of a range of marsh management activities throughout the species’ range. Partners are working to identify historic and modern marsh manipulations to determine which ones are not healthy for salt marsh regeneration and working to restore areas which are water logged or holding back water. Novel approaches such as thin layer deposition, ditch remediation and re-vegetation are also underway (K. O'Brien in litt. 2020). The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture (ACJV) have developed a series of objectives to first stabilise, then increase Saltmarsh Sparrow populations, the focus of which centres on restoring and enhancing existing salt marsh patches and protecting adjacent inland areas that buffer existing salt marsh patches and provide corridors to allow marsh migration as sea levels rise in the future (ACJV 2020). Such plans comprise a primary focus of the ACJV's wider Salt Marsh Bird Conservation Business Plan (SMBCBP) for the Atlantic Flyway (ACJV 2019). Conservation Actions ProposedIdentify, protect and enhance high-elevation marsh suitable for breeding and less susceptible to flooding (C. Elphick in litt. 2016). Manage areas to reduce nest flooding on extreme high tides, and facilitate marsh migration at the upland edges of marshes (C. Elphick in litt. 2016).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

The exact causes of declines are unknown, but are likely to include habitat loss and degradation (particularly on stopover and wintering grounds) and climate change impacts (particularly affecting breeding productivity), as well as disturbance and hunting.","This species breeds on slightly elevated areas in the lowlands of the high Arctic especially on southward-facing slopes, as well as along the coast and islands of the Arctic Ocean (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It shows a preference for open tundra with marshy, boggy depressions and pools (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Lappo et al. 2012) from melting permafrost and snow (Snow and Perrins 1998). The nest is a cup positioned on the margins of marshes or pools, on the slopes of hummock tundra, or on dry patches in Polygonum tundra (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding success can vary year to year, with prime years yielding a higher number of juveniles (Australian BirdLife 2017). The Victorian Wader Study Group and Australasian Wader Studies Group for example recorded a higher percentage of juveniles (c. 48%) during 2016-2017 (Australian BirdLife 2017). In the winter the species chiefly occurs on coastal brackish lagoons, tidal mud- and sand-flats, estuaries, saltmarshes (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), exposed coral, rocky shores and tidewrack on sandy beaches (Urban et al. 1986), and also inland on the muddy edges of marshes, large rivers and lakes (both saline and freshwater), irrigated land, flooded areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996), dams (Urban et al. 1986) and saltpans (Khomenko 2006). Abnormal rainfall in inland sites may additionally create temporary wetlands that provide additional suitable habitat (Geering et al. 2007, Dhanjal-Adams et al. 2018). On the breeding grounds the diet of this species consists mainly of insects, such as the adults, pupae and larva of Diptera (e.g. midges, craneflies (Johnsgard 1981)) and beetles, as well as bugs and leeches (del Hoyo et al. 1996). In the winter its diet consists of polychaete worms, molluscs, crustaceans (such as amphipods, brine shrimps and copepods), and occasionally insects and seeds (del Hoyo et al.1996). It is a full migrant, moving long distances by well-travelled routes (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).","On the breeding grounds, breeding success of this species is apparently strongly correlated with lemming cycles (Underhill 1987, Summers et al. 1998) and it has been suggested (e.g. de Fouw et al. 2018) that recent falling numbers may be a reflection of collapsing lemming cycles, probably driven by climate change in the Arctic (Wauchope et al. 2017). Moreover, climate change has been identified for several shorebird species as a threat that is driving reduced breeding productivity by a number of mechanisms (e.g. Meltofte et al. 2007, Eikelenboom 2016, Kubelka et al. 2018); more research for this species specifically is needed.The species is exposed to additional threats on its staging and wintering grounds, particularly habitat degradation and conversion. At Barr Al Hikman, Oman, where up to 9% of the Asian-East African Flyway has been reported to overwinter, planned urban developments, the aquaculture (for shrimp) industry, oil refineries and disturbance from fishing industries and falcon hunting were all identified as threats by de Fouw et al. (2018) and these almost certainly apply to other important staging and wintering sites in the broader region. The extent of hunting in this region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet et al. 2016). The species is threatened on the south-east coast of India (Point Calimere) by illegal hunting (bird trapping), reservoir and marshland habitat alteration by salt-industries, and habitat degradation by diminishing rainfall (changing the salt regime) (Balachandran 2006). Rapid land use change and loss of mudflats are also major threats here (S. Jarwade in litt. 2020). It is also threatened at Walvis Bay in Namibia, a key wetland site in southern Africa, by habitat degradation (e.g. changes in the flood regime due to road building, and wetland reclamation for suburb and port development), and disturbance from tourism (Wearne and Underhill 2005). This species is susceptible to avian influenza (Melville and Shortridge 2006, Gaidet et al. 2007) and avian botulism (Blaker 1967, van Heerden 1974) so may be threatened by future outbreaks of these diseases.Significant numbers of C. ferruginea migrate down the Yellow and East China Seas where habitat loss and hunting are plausibly significant threats. Astonishingly, the extent of reclaimed land along the Yellow Sea coastline now exceeds the extent of remaining intertidal mudflat (Murray et al. 2014, IUCN 2023), suggesting that this may have contributed greatly to declines in this species. The rate of habitat lost to land reclamation has slowed since a peak around 2013, in particular in recent years due to the promised near-ceasing of land reclamation in China in early 2018 (Melville 2018); however, recent satellite data suggests that the extent of intertidal mudflat has continue to decrease, in large part due to continued reclamations in the Korean Peninsula (IUCN 2023). Mudflats have also continued to degrade in suitability for this species and other shorebirds because of the invasive alien Spartina alterniflora cordgrass, which appears to be spreading; since 2020 this threat has probably driven greater declines than planned land reclamation. In addition to land reclamation, coastal development and a rapid increase in the human population along the coastline of the Yellow Sea has led to widespread degradation of mudflats and coastal habitats used by this species; IUCN (2023) (and references therein) cite the follows as additional drivers of mudflat loss and degradation: 'processes such as changes in sediment supply, loss of coastal vegetation associated with development...erosion, redistribution of sediments due to storms, and compaction and subsidence (sinking) caused by subsurface resource and groundwater extraction are also likely to be factors'. Offshore windfarms may have a so far unquantified impact on birds due to collisions (unlikely) and displacement and disturbance of feeding birds (more likely). Disturbance on mudflats by fishermen and others using the mudflats may also be reasonably considered a threat. Hunting is also possibly a significant threat impacting this and other shorebird species on passage (Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020).","Populations breeding in Western Siberia and wintering in West Africa are estimated to total are estimated to number 300,000-400,000 birds, while those breeding in Central Siberia and wintering in south-west Asia, East and southern Africa probably total an additional c.400,000 (van Roomen et al. 2022). A further 200,000 birds are estimated wintering in South Asia, although this may be an overestimate. The East Asian-Australasian Flyway population was estimated to be c.90,000 in 2016 (Hansen et al. 2016, 2022; Mundkur and Langendoen 2022), but has probably declined sharply since then. In total, the global population size is estimated at c.990,000-1,090,000 birds. To account for considerable uncertainty in the calculations of these estimates (with added uncertainty on the extent to which populations have declined since they were made), the total global population is placed in broad bracket of 700,000-1,200,000 birds. Approximately 60-80% are suspected to be mature individuals, leaving a population of 420,000-960,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The species breeds across Arctic Siberia from the Chosa Bay to Kolyuchinskaya Gulf (north Chukotskiy Peninsula) (Russia) (Lappo et al. 2012), and winters from sub-Saharan Africa through the Middle East and south and south-east Asia to Australasia (van Gils and Wiersma 1996).","Hunting is a probable threat to this species, as the hunting of shorebirds across the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is not uncommon (see, e.g., Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020, Yong et al. 2022). The extent of hunting in the Arabian Peninsula region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet et al. 2016). This species was recorded in one of the seven trade datasets evaluated by Donald et al. (2024).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayThis species is not listed on the annexes of the European Union (EU) Birds Directive, but is covered by the general protection regime provided by Article 1 of the Directive to all naturally occurring wild species in the EU. It is listed on Annex II (strictly protected) of the pan-European Bern Convention, Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and Annex II of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). Across the EU, 374 Natura 2000 sites have been designated for the conservation of this species on passage and in winter (EUNIS 2024). It is designated as a priority species for international conservation measures by the AMBI CAFF program of the Arctic Council. Concentrations of the species when breeding and on migrations are protected in the Ust-Lensky (Yakutia) and Daursky (Chita oblast) nature reserves, the Novosibirsk Islands federal nature reserve, and a number of regional protected areas in Yakutia. It is federally listed as Critically Endangered in Australia due to rapid population declines. Some habitats along flyway routes are protected. Active management is also underway at some Australian sites to combat cord grass invasion, as well as protective measures implemented to reduce disturbance at roost sites (Clemens et al. 2020).The Australasian Wader Studies Group, along with BirdLife Australia's Shorebirds 2020 Project and committed volunteers continue to monitor migratory shorebirds within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (Vine and Maurer 2016). China is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to clear tidal mudflats of Spartina cordgrass, with the aim of eliminating 90% of it by 2025; locally, this has already been successful, for example at Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve (Stokstad 2023). The governments of China and South Korea have halted new projects that require or depend upon land reclamation, and across the Korean Peninsula the number of coastal wetlands has increased; moreover in China and South Korea, key areas for migratory shorebirds (including C. ferruginea) have been identified and prioritised by government and two World Heritage nominations have been made on these grounds (IUCN 2023). Although data on scale or impact are sparse, IUCN (2023) consider that ""support for coastal wetland conservation and wise-use appears to have increased over the last decade"". There has been a substantial increase in the number of volunteer groups and NGOs helping to monitor the migrations of shorebirds and other waterbirds, as well as increased media coverage and special events, demonstrating enhanced awareness among coastal communities (see also EAAFP 2016). North Korea became a Party to the Ramsar Convention and joined the EAAF Partnership in 2018. In 2021, the 'Regional Flyway Initiative' (RFI) was set up by the Asian Development Bank, with technical support from BirdLife International, with the aim of protecting and restoring priority wetland ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide in the East-Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), the most threatened flyway globally. The Initiative is slated for implementation in 10 East, South and Southeast Asian countries:  Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, all of which are used by C. ferruginea on northbound and southbound migrations between breeding and wintering areas. The RFI will mobilise large-scale financing to support the protection, sustainable management and restoration of at least 50 priority wetlands across ten Asian countries, with an initial financing commitment of $3 billion from the ADB (BirdLife International 2022). Over time, the RFI aims to enhance and expand the existing efforts in conserving and managing priority wetlands identified on the basis of supporting globally significant congregations of migratory waterbirds, and  leverage on collaborative opportunities with stakeholders including national governments, civil society organisations, communities, regional organisations like the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership.Conservation and Research Actions ProposedConduct research to better understand the species' dependence on key migratory staging sites, and increase knowledge of the impacts of disturbance (Anon. 2015). Protect remaining intertidal habitats across the species' range (including the Yellow Sea) to prevent further habitat loss and degradation (Yang et al. 2011, Anon. 2015), and work with governments along the East Asian – Australasian Flyway to prevent destruction of key migratory staging sites (Anon. 2015). Manage important sites to reduce the impact of disturbance (Anon. 2015). Continue and expand monitoring schemes. Raise awareness of the species. Incorporate requirements for this species and others into coastal planning (Anon. 2015). Develop climate change adaptation plans and strategies (Clemens et al. 2020).

Declines may have slowed or reversed in recent years however, the most recent population survey is yet to occur and as such, given the extremely rapid declines evidenced in recent years, the species is retained as Endangered. Further evidence that suggests declines have slowed/reversed may result in this species being listed under a lower threat category.","It is a lowland species, but has bred to 1,300 m in the Klamath area (Oregon) and along the west side of the Sierras (Beedy and Hamilton 1999). It breeds in freshwater marshes with tall emergent vegetation, as well as in stinging nettle Urtica dioica, in a wide variety of upland habitats (especially thickets of non-native Himalayan Blackberry Rubus discolor and Milk Thistle Silybum marianum), and in grain fields (especially wheat x rye 'triticale') grown as silage (Jaramillo and Burke 1999, Cook and Toft 2005). 50% of the birds in California during the 2008 statewide survey nested in triticale silage fields (Kelsey 2008). It forages mainly in open rangelands, shrublands and in some agricultural areas, particularly where livestock are present, and shows a preference for roosting in marshes (Jaramillo and Burke 1999). An opportunistic forager, during the breeding season the species takes any locally abundant insect including grasshoppers (Orthoptera), beetles and weevils (Coleoptera), caddis fly larvae (Trichoptera), moth and butterfly larvae (Lepidoptera), dragonfly larvae (Odonata), and lakeshore midges (Diptera), as well as grains, snails, and small clams (Beedy and Hamilton 1999). Breeding typically occurs between March and July, when individuals congregate to form (at least formerly) massive breeding colonies that are larger than those of any other extant North American landbird following the extinction of the Passenger Pigeon Ectopistes migratorius (Cook and Toft 2005). Recent reproductive success is significantly higher in non-native upland vegetation (primarily Himalayan blackberry) than it typically is in native wetland vegetation (cattail Typha spp. and bulrush Scirpus spp.), its predominant historic breeding habitat (Cook and Toft 2005, Meese 2008, 2009a,b). Low reproductive success is correlated with low invertebrate abundance (Meese 2013). In silage fields reproductive success can be disastrously low as harvesting can result in the loss of entire colonies with tens of thousands of nests (Cook and Toft 2005). Although it can be found throughout the breeding range during winter, the species is partly migratory, with large numbers of birds formerly being seen along the central Californian coast in the winter even though few nest in this area (Jaramillo and Burke 1999). These gatherings have seemingly ceased to occur in the space of the last decade and very few are now observed along the coast in winter (R. Meese in litt. 2016); the wintering population on the outer Point Reyes Peninsula (Marin County) was once estimated to annually comprise 15-20,000 birds but fewer than 1,000 have been seen each year since 2014 whilst a site in Solano County, comprised an estimated 50,000 birds in October 2007 but has numbered only 4,000 or fewer since 2017 (R. Meese in litt. 2016).","The most dominant causes of recent declines have been the loss of upland foraging habitat to agriculture and urbanisation, combined with low reproductive success in native habitats and complete breeding failure in harvested agricultural fields, although the latter has virtually ceased in the past 5 years due to new agricultural incentives (Cook and Toft 2005, R. Meese in litt. 2020). Losses of formerly productive foraging habitats to perennial, woody crops (primarily walnuts, almonds, pistachios and grapes) and to urbanisation are currently the most serious threats to the species's survival (R. Meese in litt. 2020). Invertebrate availability close to nesting sites during the breeding season also appears to be a major factor driving declines, and widespread application of persistent neonicotinoid insecticides may have diminished invertebrate populations close to nesting sites (Beedy and Hamilton 1997, Meese 2014, cf. Benton et al. 2002); conservation measures must focus on surrounding agricultural land and upland habitats to provide invertebrates needed for successful breeding (Meese 2013). The period of the most recent very rapid declines has coincided with significant drought throughout the state (Meese 2013, 2014, M. Holyoak in litt. 2016), which could also be expected to have reduced insect availability considerably. Separately, herbicide spraying and contaminated water are suspected to have caused complete breeding failure in several colonies (Beedy and Hamilton 1999). Historic declines may have occurred because of the loss of native wetlands (which have declined in area by over 95% since the arrival of Europeans), loss of grasslands and grasshoppers (a main component of the species's diet), hunting, and large-scale poisoning efforts to control crop depredation that continued until the 1960s (Neff 1937, DeHaven et al. 1975, Cook and Toft 2005). All blackbird species, including the Tricolored, could be legally shot up until the 1980s if causing, or about to cause, depredations in fields of ripening rice in Autumn in Sacramento Valley. Whilst the Tricolored Blackbird can no longer be targeted, other blackbird species may still be legally shot in fields of ripening rice and Tricolored Blackbird may be accidentally killed if mistaken for the essentially similar red-wing, which is primarily responsible for rice depredation (DeHaven 1971); there is currently no quantification of this threat (R. Meese in litt. 2020). Predation by non-native Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis and predation on eggs by the native White-faced Ibis (Plegadis chihi) have also been a significant threat to particular colonies in Tulare County (Meese 2012, R. Meese in litt. 2016).","The global population size has been estimated at 175,000 individuals (Meese 2017), up slightly from the estimate of 145,000 individuals in 2014 (Meese 2014), indicating that the global population is considerably below 200,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"Agelaius tricolor is near-endemic to California, breeding mainly in the Central Valley and other points west of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada, U.S.A. It has also been recorded in Oregon, from one site in western Nevada (Ammon and Woods 2008), Washington (Beedy and Hamilton 1999), and extreme northwest Baja California (Mexico). It has a limited range, which has not contracted since the 1930s. Californian birds are thought to make up over 95% of the global population (Cook and Toft 2005). In 1934, systematic surveys estimated over 700,000 adults in just 8 Californian counties, and found breeding birds in 26 counties, including one colony containing over 200,000 nests (c.300,000 adults) covering 24 ha (Neff 1937). Studies in 1969-1972 reported an average of about 133,000 individuals/year in Central Valley (DeHaven et al. 1975). Trend identification in the species has been hampered by the itinerant nature of colonies formed in agricultural, hence ephemeral, habitats (Hamilton III 1998), which now represent the largest proportion of the breeding population (Graves et al. 2013). What is clear is there was a decline exceeding 63% between the 1930s and 1980s (Beedy et al. 1991, Graves et al. 2013), and further declines have occurred since (Cook and Toft 2005, Meese 2014). Censuses conducted in California in 1994, 1997 and 2000 gave figures of 370,000, 233,000 and 162,000 individuals respectively (Beedy and Hamilton 1999, Cook and Toft 2005), equating to a decline of 56% in six years. However, a volunteer-based census in California in 2005 located 257,000 individuals attending 121 breeding colonies (King et al. 2006). A more extensive state-wide census using uniform methods supported by data entry and management provided by the Tricolored Blackbird Portal (http://tricolor.ice.ucdavis.edu) has been undertaken triennially from 2008 (Meese 2014, 2015). In 2008, 394,858 individuals were recorded at 180 sites in 32 counties (Kelsey 2008), 259,322 at 138 sites in 29 counties in 2011 (Kelsey 2011) and 145,135 at 143 sites in 37 counties in 2014 and 884 locations in 44 counties in 2017 (Meese 2014, 2017). The number of breeding sites surveyed increased in each survey, with a total of 802 in 2014 (Meese 2014). These results suggest that recent declines have been in excess of 60%, even if there had been a period of less rapid declines prior to this. Meehan et al. (2019) also report a ~40% decline in A. tricolor average colony size between 2008-2017 whilst Robinson et al. (2018) report a mean decline of 34% in Californian tricolored blackbird populations between 2007-2016 based on citizen science data. The Christmas Bird Count has recorded the species regularly at 120 sites over a 39 year period (G. Butcher in litt. 2006), but numbers are so low compared to the size of breeding colonies that any population level inference from this data is difficult (M. Holyoak in litt. 2016). Indeed, it is reported that non-breeding gatherings along the central Californian coast have ceased within the last decade (R. Meese in litt. 2016). ","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declined to list the species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in August 2019 but the California Department of Fish and Wildlife listed the species as Threatened under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA) in April 2019. Previously it has been classified in California as a Species of Special Concern and a Migratory Bird of Management Concern, categories which identify reduced populations but do not include the legal protections offered to species listed as threatened (Cook and Toft 2005). A Conservation Plan for the species was published in 2007 (Tricolored Blackbird Working Group 2007). Measures have been taken at times to protect nesting colonies of the species, including purchasing portions of crops, or delaying harvest to avoid impacting nests during the active breeding season. Breeding colonies are now fully protected under CESA and all harvest of grain field colonies should cease. No breeding colonies were known to have been lost due to harvest of their grain field nesting substrates in 2018 nor 2019. These actions and participation by landowners resulted in the recruitment of an estimated 37,000 to 44,000 first-year adults to the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons (Beedy and Hamilton 1999) and benefited the population in 2003. However, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service took the position that crop purchases or reimbursements for delayed harvest are not a feasible long-term solution for the species's management on private agricultural lands (M. Bond in litt. 2005). Management guidelines have been produced (Beedy and Hamilton 1997, DeHaven 2000, Meese and Beedy 2015). In 2015, a voluntary 5-year program was established to compensate dairy operators for delaying the harvest of their occupied grain fields until after the young had fledged in order to reduce losses due to agricultural operations (R. Meese in litt. 2016), ending in 2019. An extensive state-wide census using uniform methods supported by data entry and management provided by the Tricolored Blackbird Portal (http://tricolor.ice.ucdavis.edu) has been undertaken triennially from 2008 (Meese 2014, 2015) and since 2015, an additional sampling survey has been undertaken (Meese et al. 2015) although funding constraints prevented the survey occurring annually as was hoped..Conservation Actions ProposedMaintain a viable, self-sustaining population throughout current geographic range. Avoid losses of colonies and their associated habitats and increase the breeding population on suitable public and private lands managed for this species. Enhance public awareness and support for protection of habitat and active colonies (Beedy and Hamilton 1997). Create secure nesting substrates within key dairy regions of the San Joaquin valley, to provide alternative nesting sites to grain silage fields, and monitor their use (DeHaven 2000, Meese and Beedy 2015). Delay harvesting or herbicide applications until after the colony completes the breeding cycle (Beedy and Hamilton 1999). Continue the triennial range-wide censuses to monitor the population and annual sampling survey to monitor trends in core areas. Continue mark-recapture and ratio-telemetry studies to determine demographic rates such as survival, reproduction, and population growth, and site fidelity as related to reproductive success. Conduct studies of foraging ecology to elucidate determinants of reproductive success and identify possibilities to enhance foraging habitat.

Therefore, it is listed as Vulnerable.","It is a native-prairie specialist (Anstey et al. 1995), its breeding range restricted to short-grass and mixed-grass prairie regions, and its wintering range restricted to dry grasslands and deserts, where it feeds on grains in high density flocks (Hill and Gould 1997). It prefers native grasslands recently disturbed by fire, grazing or mowing, and will avoid nesting in areas protected from grazing or cultivated fields (Maher 1973, Owens and Myres 1973). Critical habitat has been identified as open areas of upland native grassland &gt; 39 ha in fair to excellent range condition with flat to gently rolling topography and with limited woody vegetation or invasion by exotic grasses (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018, COSEWIC 2019, D. Hill in litt. 2020).","As a result of conversion of native prairie to croplands and urban developments it has disappeared from much of its historical breeding range (e.g. in Kansas, Nebraska and Minnesota); the species exhibits significantly lower nest survival and fledges fewer young in non-native grassland pastures compared to native prairies (Lloyd and Martin 2005, Davis et al. 2016). Fragmentation of native grasslands reduces the suitability of breeding habitat (D. P. Hill and L. K. Gould in litt. 2016); a study in southern Saskatchewan found that the species did not use habitat patches &lt;39 ha (Davis 2004). Abundance, and nest fledging, success and productivity are reduced along roads (Sutter et al. 2000) and in close proximity to oil and gas wells (Ng 2017, Yoo and Koper 2017, Ng 2019, PCAP 2019). It exhibits delayed displacement (&gt;300 m) in response to wind energy infrastructure (Shaffer and Buhl 2015). Conversion of the species's wintering habitat to irrigated agriculture in Mexico also poses a threat (G. Butcher in litt. 2016). Recent conversion of grasslands to cropland in the Valles Centrales (the largest known wintering population of c.250,000 individuals) of Chihuahua, Mexico, is estimated to have displaced more than 130,000 wintering individuals (Pool et al. 2014). The wintering range has also contracted: this is presumed to have resulted from a population decline. Brown-headed cowbirds parasitise this species at low to moderate rates and there is a high level of predation by native predators (Hill and Gould 1997, Shaffer et al. 2019). It can be vulnerable to disturbance (Hill and Gould 1997), and it has been reported killed at communication towers (Longcore et al. 2013). The species is also thought vulnerable to predicted drying as a result of climate change in the western part of its breeding range and in the wintering range (G. Butcher in litt. 2016), although Wilson et al. (2018) modelled data suggested that the species's range size illustrates no significant response to changing drought conditions.",Partners in Flight (2019) currently estimate the population to number 3.1 million mature individuals.,Decreasing,"This species breeds in the Great Plains (north and central U.S.A.) and the Canadian Prairie Provinces (southern central Canada), and winters in south-central and south-western U.S.A. and north-central Mexico (Hill and Gould 1997, Ellison et al. 2017); it typically migrates along the central flyway to the east of breeding sites, circumventing high elevation terrain (Ellison et al. 2017). It has undergone long-term population declines so that it is now rare or extirpated as a breeding species in a number of States formerly occupied.","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is included on the 'Watch List' of the State of North America's Birds as a species of high conservation concern (NABCI 2016). It was listed as Threatened in Canada in 2009 (Committee on the Status of Wildlife in Canada 2009) and was listed under Schedule 1 of Canada's Species at Risk Act (SARA) in 2012 (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018). A recovery strategy for the species has been proposed under the Species at Risk Act (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018). The plan involves protecting remaining native grassland, reducing further habitat fragmentation from roads and possibly restoring native prairies from existing cropland (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2018). It has been the focus of a number of studies on the breeding grounds, but no species-specific management actions are in place. A multi-species action has been completed in southwestern Saskatchewan (Environment and Climate Change Canada 2016) and will be amended to include chestnut-collared longspur (Environment and Climate Change Canada. 2018). It is included in multi-species studies taking place on the wintering grounds in Chihuahua, Mexico (G. Butcher in litt. 2016).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue monitoring the species. Identify key migration stopovers and wintering sites, and threats to these areas.

In Canada, it also inhabits regenerating clear-cuts and coastal areas with spruce-fir at low elevations (Atwood et al. 1996). In winter, it occurs in moist broadleaved and mixed pine-broadleaved montane forests and secondary woodlands (Rimmer 1996; Raffaele et al. 1998; Rimmer et al. 1999; Townsend et al. 2011, 2012). It nests in June-July (present on breeding grounds May-October), sometimes with high failure rates (Rimmer 1996). The species sexually segregates in winter with females typically occurring in moderately disturbed mid-elevation rainforests of the Cordillera Septentrional and males more commonly found in the more prisitine cloud forest of remote ranges such as Sierra de Bahoruco and Cordillera Central in the Dominican Republic (McFarland et al. 2018).","The species is impacted by a number of threats however, the three most significant primary threats are currently considered to be: incompatible forestry practices throughout breeding grounds, particularly in Canada; the clearing and burning of forests in wintering habitat in the Dominican Republic and Haiti for conversion to agricultural fields and additional land uses; and ongoing climate change and a shift and contraction of its breeding range (Lloyd and McFarland 2017). In Quebec, the widespread practice of thinning renders habitat unsuitable (G. Seutin in litt. 1999) and forest loss within this species's range is currently estimated at ~2.78% across a ten year period (Tracewski et al. 2016). Agricultural conversion, logging, mining and charcoal production are rapidly clearing and fragmenting winter habitat (Atwood et al. 1996; C. C. Rimmer in litt. 1998, 1999; Lloyd and McFarland 2017) whilst invasive rats Rattus rattus  pose a threat through predation in the winter range (Erickson 2011). Furthermore, projected climate change is expected to result in dramatic decreases in the extent of suitable habitat in the species's breeding habitat, predominantly through the replacement of balsam fir by unsuitable hardwood forest (C. C. Rimmer in litt. 1998, 1999; K. McFarland in litt. 1999; Rodenhouse et al. 2008; Ralston and Kirchman 2013; Lloyd and McFarland 2017); climate change is currently predicted to reduce suitable montane balsam fir forest within its breeding habitat by over 50% by 2100 under worst-case climate change scenarios, with severe effects evident by just 2080 (Hill and Lloyd 2017; Cadieux et al. 2019). Furthermore, whilst warmer temperatures are expected to force this species upslope on mountains that lack the elevation extent to accommodate such change, asymmetrical interspecific aggression from the Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus) migrating up from below may further 'push' Bicknell's Thrush upslope, restricting its range and increasing its threat to a greater extent (Freeman and Montgomery 2016). Acid precipitation may have damaged breeding habitat in the 1960s and 1970s (Phillips 1991; Rimmer 1996) although it is thought to have predominantly impacted one tree species that is not widely abundant throughout this species's montane forest habitat (K. McFarland in litt. 2020). Ski-resort, communication and wind-power developments potentially threaten local populations (Atwood et al. 1996; Rimmer 1996). The species has been seen to be most seriously adversely impacted during the construction and early operational years of wind infrastructure due to habitat loss and disturbance, however many site were recolonised within 8 years post-construction (Lemaître and Lamarre 2020).","Hill and Lloyd (2017) estimate there to be 71,318 individuals (c. 56,080-89,748) in the U.S.A. whilst COSEWIC (2009) suggested a population of 40,570 and 49,258 individuals in Canada. This suggests a population size between 111,888 and 120,396 individuals, similar to the overall population sizes suggested by IBTCG (2010), 95,000-126,000 individuals and Hill and Lloyd (2017), &lt;120,000 individuals. The population is therefore assumed to comprise fewer than 120,000 individuals, or 80,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Catharus bicknelli breeds patchily in south-east Quebec and the Maritime provinces, Canada, and eastern New York and northern New England, U.S.A. (Phillips 1991; Ouellet 1993; Atwood et al. 1996). There are an estimated 71,318 individuals in the USA  (Hill and Lloyd 2017) and 1,000-3,000 birds in the Maritime provinces (D. Busby in litt. 1999), but there have been local extinctions (C. C. Rimmer in litt. 1998, 1999). It migrates along the coast to winter in the Caribbean (Raffaele et al. 1998). The stronghold is the Dominican Republic (especially the Sierra de Baoruco and Cordillera Central) whilst it also occurs in Haiti, Puerto Rico (almost entirely within the high elevations in the Cordillera Central [Rimmer et al. 2019]), eastern Cuba and in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica (McFarland et al. 2013; Lloyd and Rimmer 2017; Rimmer et al. 2019; eBird 2020). The population is suspected to be in rapid decline overall. Population trend data show mixed results, but annual declines of 7-19% have been documented in parts of the species’s breeding range (IBTCG 2010). An analysis of several combined data sets revealed an overall decline of c.2.5% per year in New York and New England (Ralston et al. 2015). Surveys (conducted through the High Elevation Landbird Program) in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia recorded apparent declines of c.16% per year and 11% per year respectively between 2002 and 2010 (Campbell 2011). Results from the second Maritime Breeding Bird Atlas show a greater than 40% decline in the distribution of the species between 1999 and 2009 (COSEWIC 2009). The State of the Mountain Birds 2020 report (Vermont Centre for Ecostudies) suggests such declines exhibit strong regional and temporal variability however, it concurrently concludes that the species has likely declined by ~2.41% per year over the last decade throughout the USA, despite localised increases (e.g. Vermont), and that populations are likely declining globally (Hill 2020). The current population estimate for the species in Canada is between 40,570 and 49,258 birds (COSEWIC 2009), with global estimates of &lt;120,000 individuals (IBTCG 2010; Hill and Lloyd 2017). ","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix II. SPAW Protocol Annex II. There is much research activity in the breeding range and, increasingly, the Caribbean. Some important breeding areas and c.50% of sites in the Dominican Republic are actively protected (Rimmer et al. 1999), but recent funding requests for management were turned down. Management and protection of existing reserves and parks is now inadequate (C. Rimmer in litt. 2003) although almost one-third of available wintering habitat remains within protected areas (McFarland et al. 2013). A 400 ha abandoned farm, situated along the Cordillera Septentrional between existing protected areas in the Dominican Republic, was recently purchased through the application of a Bicknell's Thrush abundance model and in doing so, became the Dominican Republic's first-ever private reserve, targeted at the conservation of this species (McFarland et al. 2018). A predictive model has recently been developed to produce a fine-scale population estimate for the species throughout the USA (Hill and Lloyd 2017); modelled distributions and population sizes should be used to inform and plan habitat management/alteration decisions (Lambert et al. 2005). New (and expansion of existing) ski-resorts are developed following environmental impact assessment, in a way that mitigates against habitat loss and disturbance (Anon. 2006). One development established a fund for protecting the wintering grounds (Anon. 2006). A conservation action plan was produced for the species in 2010 by the International Bicknell’s Thrush Conservation Group (IBTCG), with the overall goal of achieving a 25% population increase during the period 2011-2060 and no further net loss in distribution (IBTCG 2010). This action plan was updated in 2017 to provide contemporary, up-to-date assessments of the species status and threats, and conservation actions required for its preservation (Lloyd and McFarland 2017).Conservation Actions ProposedFurther clarify distribution and migration details (Atwood et al. 1996; Rimmer 1996).

If the decline is found to be larger, the species would qualify for uplisting.","This species is found offshore and along sea coasts, mostly over the continental shelf to the edge, but also beyond into deep ocean. It feeds mostly on crustaceans throughout the year, supplemented by other invertebrates and small larval fish. The start of the breeding season varies greatly with latitude, from November in Baja California to possibly July in Alaska with laying typically timed to coincide with the spring zooplankton peaks (M. Hipfner in litt. 2020). The bird is known to double-brood, particularly in years characterised by high marine productivity (Johns et al. 2017). Birds form colonies from under 500 birds to over one million, usually at high densities on coastal islands with or without trees, and nesting on a wide range of habitats. It displays complex wintering patterns and whilst once thought to winter mainly offshore within the breeding range, with southerly populations being relatively sedentary compared to northern individuals which migrate south (del Hoyo et al. 1996), the species is now known to exhibit temporally and spatially variable migration patterns on an interannual basis. Tracking of individuals from British Colombia, Canada, the largest population of P. aleuticus individuals, illustrates both north (summer, fall) and south (fall, winter) migrations with distributions ranging from B.C. to the Aleutian Islands and Baja California at distances of 2757 and 3110 km respectively (Studholme et al. 2019). Migration behaviour also appears to be flexible, varying year-on-year in response to changeable oceanographic and environmental conditions, although some fixed migratory behaviour appears apparent (Studholme et al. 2019).","Introduced predators represent the most serious threat to Cassin’s Auklet colonies (Nettleship 1996, Rodway and Lemon 2011). House Rats Rattus rattus were introduced on Langara in the early 20th century (first noted in 1946), followed by Brown Rats R. norvegicus a few decades later (first noted in 1981) (Bertram and Nagorsen 1995). The auklet population on Langara and adjacent Cox and Lucy islands was extirpated by 1981 (Drent and Guiguet 1961, Rodway 1991) and only small numbers of auklets had recolonized Langara by 2004 (Regehr et al. 2007). Similarly, as House Rats invaded Anacapa, the local auklet population was completely or nearly extirpated between 1910 and 1975. After rat eradication, a total of 42 auklet nests in six discrete breeding areas were discovered between 2003 and 2012 (Whitworth et al. 2015). Recurring recolonization following rat eradication from the species's previous range indicate the substantial impact of rat predation on the species's distribution. Cats Felis catus were the likely driver of elimination or severe reductions, as it occurred in colonies from four Mexican islands (McChesney and Tershy 1998, Wolf et al. 2006). Raccoons Procyon lotor were introduced to the Queen Charlotte Islands in the early 1940s (which hold 18% of the world population of Cassin's Auklet), and two to four raccoons alone were responsible for up to 80% of observed predation on sub-adult and adult birds, while also depredating eggs and chicks (Hartman et al. 1997). Mink and raccoons are considered responsible for the extirpation of the once large colonies on Lanx and Cox Islands, Scott Archipelago in the 1930s (Hipfner et al. 2010). Further range expansion by raccoons in this region may pose a significant conservation threat to the seabird populations on the islands (Hartman and Eastman 1999). Red Foxes Vulpes vulpes occur naturally on some near-shore islands along the Alaska Peninsula and on the Fox Islands in the eastern Aleutians. Following the release of foxes on more than 450 previously fox-free Alaskan islands, populations of nesting birds were severely reduced through increased predation levels on eggs, nestlings and adult birds (Bailey and Kaiser 1993). Currently, fox predation pressure may be alleviating, due to their removal from 39 islands of more than 500,000 ha. Further eradications are being planned for at least four more islands (Veitch and Clout 2002). Light pollution may cause disorientation of auklets and prolong the period of effective predation. Exceptionally bright lights used in the squid jigging fishery close to breeding colonies lead to greatly increased predation by Barn Owls Tyto alba and possibly Western Gulls Larus occidentalis, and may also cause collision mortality and discourage adults from returning to shore (Harfenist 2004). In addition to predation pressures, the species's habitat is threatened by introduced herbivores which destroy and degrade nesting habitat by trampling nests, browsing native vegetation and increasing erosion of topsoil. Goats Capra hircus introduced to Guadalupe Island in the 1800s intensively trampled and browsed the nesting habitat of the Guadalupe Storm-petrel Oceanodroma macrodactyla, likely contributing to the apparent extinction of the species (Wolf et al. 2006). Considering the Cassin’s Auklets similar burrowing nesting habit, it is also at risk from habitat destruction by goats. Likewise, rabbits have been considered a threat due to habitat conversion and competition with burrowing birds. However, Hipfner et al. (2010) found similar vegetation changes on Triangle Island which hosts rabbits and the neighbouring rabbit-free Sartine Island. Although the driving mechanism is uncertain, the decrease in Tufted Hairgrass Deschampsia cespitosa cover at the expense of Salmonberry Rubus spectabilis poses a serious risk to the species, restricting the area of suitable nesting habitat. The species is vulnerable to the effects of climate change, particularly changes in sea temperature regimes and coastal upwelling systems (Wolf et al. 2010). The frequency and magnitude of anomalous ocean conditions is expected to increase, threatening the long-term stability of some Cassin’s Auklet populations through decreased availability of krill and associated mortality and low recruitment; this particularly impacts auklets throughout the southern portion of its range, and those that winter in California, for whom krill comprises a major prey (Bertram et al. 2001, Hipfner 2008). Similarly. on Triangle Island, British Colombia, Canada, nesting success has been evidenced to be lower in warm-water years due to both the reduced abundance and, more importantly, earlier disappearance of the prey copepod Neocalanus cristatus. N. cristatus disappearance occurred on average 2-3 weeks earlier in warm-water years, reducing Auklet survival to, and weight at, fledging, thereby highlighting the significant impact of not just prey abundance, but also prey timing on predator survival as ocean conditions continue to warm (Hipfner 2008). Low breeding success has been documented in strong El Niño years (e.g., 1983, 1992, and 1997) (Manugian et al. 2015). During a 15-year study period (1994–2008), two extreme climate events (a strong El Niño event in 1997–1998 and an atmospheric blocking event in 2005) were both associated with a halving of the adult survival of female Cassin's Auklets (Morrison et al. 2011). Auklets have shown ability to respond adaptively to variation in oceanographic conditions and prey availability by modifying timing of breeding; however, in years when ocean conditions deteriorated after the initiation of breeding, prey availability was severely reduced beyond the birds’ potential for an adaptive response, resulting in diminished nestling growth and productivity (Abraham and Sydeman 2004, Manugian et al. 2015). Negative effects of climatic variation on both reproductive success and the survival of adult females is thought to be driving the ongoing decline in the Cassin's Auklet population on Triangle Island (Morrison et al. 2011). Likewise, the fluctuations in the northern Californian populations may be partially explained by anomalous warm-water conditions (Nettleship 1996), which are also thought to be responsible for the mass die-off of over 100,000 individuals reported from California to central British Columbia and Alaska through 2014 into January 2015 (Welch 2015, Devitt and Jardine 2016, Jones et al. 2018). Oil pollution represents a significant threat and extractive operations may impact negatively on the species through increased pollution and collision with lights (Harfenist 2004). Past oil spills are known to have impacted the species. For example, in the 1986 Apex Houston oil spill, an estimated total of 10,577 birds were debilitated or killed (Page and Carter 1986, Page et al. 1990), including 'a smaller number' of Cassin's Auklets (Carter et al. 2003). Sub-lethal doses of petroleum have been found to reduce reproductive success in the species (Ainley et al. 1981). The species is also known to be exposed to varying degrees of plastic pollution although it is not yet clear whether exposure to such pollution is of significant impact to the species (Floren and Shugart 2017, O'Hara et al. 2019). Declines have also been attributed to increases in numbers of native predators, including Bald Eagle Haliaeetus leucocephalus, Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus and Western Gull Larus occidentalis in some areas (Nettleship 1996). The Cassin’s Auklet was among the most common prey found in a Bald Eagle nest in California (23 out of 297 birds were of this species) (Erlandsson et al. 2007). Reports also include heavy predation by Western Gulls (Thoresen 1964, Manuwal 1979, Nelson 1989) and Peregrine Falcons, particularly on Triange Island where Auklets comprise the Peregrine's primary prey (Hipfner et al. 2011, M. Hipfner in litt. 2020). The seabird tick Ixodes uriae is also known to parasitise the species however, its influence appears minimal and doesn't seem influence P. aleuticus survival to fledging (Hipfner et al. 2019). Human disturbance may also be contributing to reduced reproductive success in parts of the range. Birds whose burrows were closer to foodpaths or villages had a higher rate of nest abandonment and lower breeding success compared to birds nesting further away from settlements and passageways (Albores-Barajas and Soldatini 2011). Although chicks did not show any effect of disturbance in the early stages of growth, chicks in the experimentally disturbed groups stopped gaining weight sooner than undisturbed controls and fledged at lower weights (6 to 9% less) (Albores-Barajas et al. 2009). Bycatch mortality of the species was recorded in the pelagic salmon driftnet fishery in the 1970s and 1980s (Ainley et al. 1981) and off British Columbia between 1995 and 2001 (Smith and Morgan 2005), but reduced fishing effort and greater fisheries restrictions have resulted in significant reductions in bycatch of Marbled Murrelet Brachyramphus marmoratus (caught in similar numbers to Cassin's Auklet in previous studies), and is no longer considered a driver of significant decline in that species (Zydelis et al. 2013). As such, it is unlikely that bycatch is impacting the Cassin's Auklet population at greater than a negligible rate.","The total population is estimated to be at least 3,600,000 breeding birds (Nettleship 1996), which equates to approximately 5,400,000 individuals.",Decreasing,"The species ranges from Baja California (Mexico) up the Pacific coast of the U.S.A. and Canada, through Alaska to the Aleutian Islands (U.S.A.) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). British Columbia (Canada) supports the largest population with approximately 2,700,000 breeding birds in the 1980s; it is estimated that there are approximately 600,000 birds in Alaska, 88,000 in Washington, 500 in Oregon, 131,000 in California and 20,000-40,000 in Baja California on the islands of San Benito, San Geronimo, Asuncion and San Roque (Nettleship 1996).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayThe species, its eggs and nests are protected from hunting and collecting in the U.S.A. and Canada under the Migratory Birds Convention Act (Harfenist 2004). In 2002, a rat eradication programme was carried out on Ancapa Island, California. Within one year, Cassin's Auklets were recolonizing the island and between 2003 and 2012 a total of 42 nests were discovered (Whitworth et al. 2015). Rat eradication programmes have been carried out in other areas of the species's range, including Langara Island, British Columbia (Regehr et al. 2007). The designation of the Scott Islands Marine Wildlife Area (MWA) in British Colombia, Canada also aims to help protect foraging habitat for the species whilst also including plans to eradicate mink and raccoons from Lanz and Cox Islands to allow Auklets to recolonise both islands (Hipfner et al. 2011, M. Hipfner in litt. 2020) .Conservation and Research Actions ProposedImplement control programmes at breeding sites to remove invasive predators and problematic livestock (Nettleship 1996).

Further evidence that confirms declines are more widespread and severe than currently thought may result in this species being uplisted to a higher threat level.,"Most populations strongly associate with either old-growth conifer or pine-oak forests (Johnsgard 1988, Gutiérrez et al. 1995), but some lucida also occur in heavily logged secondary pine-oak forest, warmer and drier conditions and on bare rocky cliffs and canyons (Lammertink et al. 1996,  J. M. Lammertink in litt. 1998, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012, Bowden et al. 2015). It occurs from sea-level to 1,200 m in the northern part of its range, and to 2,700 m in the southern part. Nests are generally in trees within closed-canopy forest, (usually in cavities or on stick platforms constructed originally by raptors, wood rats or squirrels) on cliff-ledges in steep-walled canyons (and occasionally in caves (Wilk et al. 2018). Eggs are laid from March to May. Young birds are obligate dispersers, whilst unpaired birds or those that have failed to breed previously also disperse (Forsman et al. 2002, Blakesley et al. 2006, Ganey et al. 2014a); this may help to sustain some sink populations. It may make some movements in winter, including to recently burnt areas as these can have greater food availability (Ganey et al. 2014b). It feeds principally on nocturnal mammals.","The two principle threats to the Spotted Owl are currently considered to be competition with the Barred Owl (Strix varia) and logging of the species's habitat. Spotted Owl faces strong competition from Barred Owl which is gradually displacing Spotted Owls from much of the northern part of their range, outcompeting Spotted Owls for food and space, reducing Spotted Owl occupancy and breeding propensity, and occasionally hybridising (Kelly and Forsman 2004, Gutiérrez et al. 2007, Wiens et al. 2014, Dugger et al. 2016, Long and Wolfe 2019, Mangan et al. 2019). While S. varia is not known to have affected the population trend in California yet, some hybrids have been noted there and it does appear to be spreading into the range of California Spotted Owl (Tempel et al. 2014a, Gutiérrez et al. 2017, Wood et al. 2019). Degradation and fragmentation of its habitat through clear felling and selective logging of large trees is a primary threat to the species (Gutiérrez et al. 1995, Jones et al. 2018); with habitat fragmentation shown to correlate with decreased probability of survival (Schilling et al. 2013); the rate of logging is however reported to have declined notably in the past 20-30 years (Gutiérrez et al. 2017, J. Dunk in litt. 2020). This has been compounded by the removal of a legal requirement that the U. S. Forest Service assess the viability of wildlife on national forest lands (Noon and Blakesley 2006). Forest loss throughout the species's range is currently estimated at ~7.25% over three generations (Tracewski et al. 2016). Populations in the southwest of its range, California, and dry inland forests of the Pacific Northwest are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation caused by high-severity fire (Jones et al. 2019) and drought associated with climate change (see Peery et al. 2011, Jones et al. 2016, T. Supplee in litt. 2011, Gutiérrez et al. 2017, Wan et al. 2019) although low- and moderate-severity fires are not thought to significantly affect the species (see Bond et al. 2002, Roberts et al. 2011, Lee et al. 2012, Willey and van Riper III 2014, Ganey et al. 2017) and may even create favourable foraging conditions (Eyes et al. 2017). Habitat loss to wildfire has been greater than expected in recent years, raising the economic value of remaining habitat (D. Heiken in litt. 2012). Projected climate change may result in hotter and drier summers with longer fire seasons and larger more intense fires, as well as increased tree mortality from drought and insects, and uncertainty over the viability of habitat restoration. Further effects from climate change may affect different areas differently (see Peery et al. 2011) and could include changes in the frequency and duration of inclement weather during the breeding season (D. Heiken in litt. 2012); and in the Pacific Northwest it may lead to wetter and warmer winters (Glenn et al. 2010). Timber harvesting on private land is a significant threat, as well as renewed pressure to eliminate protections for the species on federal land in Oregon, in order to allow increased logging (T. Supplee in litt. 2011, R. Gutiérrez in litt. 2016). Unfavourable management includes intensive thinning of suitable habitat, which is expected to result in declines over the short term (T. Supplee in litt. 2011), as well as logging and manipulation of canopy vegetation to reduce the risk of wildfire (B. Bird in litt. 2012, D. Heiken in litt. 2012). The species may also face high levels of disturbance, especially in recreational areas where it occurs such as National Parks (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Energy development and associated habitat loss and mortalities from collisions with powerlines could also be affecting this species, but the degree of impact is essentially unknown (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Potentially serious threats include West Nile virus, which is fatal to the species (although it may be absent from some subpopulations [Hull et al. 2010]), the potential loss of habitat to Sudden Oak Death Syndrome (D. Heiken in litt. 2012), and avian malaria, which has been discovered in the species and found to weaken infected individuals, probably reducing reproductive success (Ishak et al. 2008, D. Heiken in litt. 2012). Enhanced exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides (AR), illegally utilised, in and widely contaminating the remote forests of California, USA, may also be adversely impacting the species (Gabriel et al. 2018, Wiens et al. 2019a). Other potential threats have been put forward, for instance it has been mooted that water management could possibly have an impact on the species through indirect effects, though these will require further study (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012, Gutiérrez et al. 2017).","Its population size was estimated at c.15,000 mature individuals (Rich et al. 2004). However, this has likely declined in recent years and population surveys are urgently required to accurately quantify the population size of this species.",Decreasing,"Strix occidentalis has five subspecies: caurina ('Northern Spotted Owl') is estimated to number 3,778 pairs and 1,001 territorial individuals from south-west British Columbia, Canada, to north California, USA, although this number may have declined in recent years; the nominate ('California Spotted Owl') has a minimum of 3,050 individuals in central and south California, USA, and (formerly) Baja California, Mexico; and lucida, juanaphillipsae and huachucae ('Mexican Spotted Owl') (see del Hoyo and Collar 2014). Subspecies huachuacae occurs from Utah and Colorado to Arizona, New Mexico and extreme west Texas, USA, while lucida occurs in Sonora, Chihuahua and Nuevo León to Jalisco, Durango, Michoacán and Guanajuanto, Mexico (Johnsgard 1988, Sibley and Monroe 1990, Gutiérrez et al. 1995, Lammertink et al. 1996, AOU 1998, del Hoyo and Collar 2014), and juanaphillipsae has been recently described from the State of Mexico (Dickerman 1997). Mexican Spotted Owl may be considered to be declining (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012), although Mexican populations may be stable because forestry activities there typically modify rather than destroy habitat (Lammertink et al. 1996, J. M. Lammertink in litt. 1998) and at least locally in New Mexico some subpopualations may be increasing (Ganey et al. 2014b). Most other populations are declining and, in some, the decline is accelerating because of clear-felling and selective logging (Gutiérrez et al. 1995, Noon and McKelvey 1996). Subspecies caurina is estimated to be in significant decline, at 3.8% per year range-wide and 8.4% per year in Washington State (1985-2013; Dugger et al. 2016), and is close to extinction in Canada. California Spotted Owl is declining in the Sierra Nevada, apart from at one site in a National Park (see Tempel et al. 2014b, Gutiérrez et al. 2017).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions Underway CITES Appendix II. The Northern (caurina) and Mexican (lucida) subspecies are listed as Threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and are the subject of recovery plans (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011, 2012). The Northwest Forest Plan was created to provide protection and reduce rates of timber harvest leading to habitat destruction. Protected Activity Centres are advocated for as an effective mechanism of conserving the species in parts of its range (Verner et al. 1992, Willey and van Riper III 2007). In 2012 9.6 million acres of habitat was designated as critical habitat for the Northern Spotted Owl by U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Society for Conservation Biology 2012, Dunk et al. 2019). A captive breeding programme was started at the Mountain View Conservation and Breeding Centre, British Columbia, with a second attempt in Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. Neither have so far had much success (Moore 2013). Experimental removal of Barred Owls is underway (Oregon Fish and Wildlife Service and U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2013, A. Franklin in litt. 2016, Wiens et al. 2019b).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor population trends across its range, and monitor the effects of conservation actions (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012), including Barred Owl control. Conduct research into broad areas of the species's biology such as interspecific interactions, population structure and habitat relationships (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2012). Maintain and restore habitat; large reserves, encompassing suitable habitat and widely distributed are needed to retain the owl's current range and a halt to logging operations throughout parts of its range are required to prevent local extinctions. Use analyses to inform habitat management decisions, and ensure appropriate habitat management, which may involve habitat restoration and recovery (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service 2011, 2012, Peery et al. 2017). Large-scale Barred Owl control efforts are likely to be needed, especially for the Northern Spotted Owl, but may also be required within the range of the California Spotted Owl to prevent local extinctions in parts of the species's range. Calls have been made for captive breeding of birds from the tiny remaining British Columbian population. Investigate the threats posed by West Nile virus, avian malaria, water management and climate change, and research the effect of wildfires and controlled burning on spotted owls (Gutiérrez et al. 2017).

Therefore, the species is precautionarily listed as Endangered.","The species breeds in juniper-oak woodlands, where it depends on Ashe Juniper Juniperus ashei bark for nesting material (Lockwood 1996), and individuals are highly philopatric, returning to the same site each year (Ladd and Gass 1999); the species has been shown to exhibit strong conspecific attraction when selecting areas to establish breeding territories (Farrell et al. 2012). The species does not saturate all available habitat though (it may require patches of &gt;15 ha in rural areas and &gt;26 ha in urban areas [Robinson et al. 2018, Reidy et al. submitted per Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests in litt. 2018]), and density increases with greater canopy cover and height, and increased cover of mixed juniper-oak (USFWS 1992; Peak and Thompson 2013; Reidy et al. 2016, 2017). Nest building begins in early to mid-March, and eggs may be laid until mid-May (Ladd and Gass 1999, J. Reidy in litt. 2012, J. Scalise in litt. 2018). Although productivity appears to be higher in Texas Red Oak (Quercus buckleyi) habitat compared to Post Oak (Q. stellata) (Marshall et al. 2013), Campomizzi et al. (2012) found that the relationship between reproductive success and habitat conditions varies across the breeding range.In winter, it occurs predominantly in pine-oak forested habitats in mixed-species flocks, foraging at sites with a high density of ""encino"" oaks (in comparison to pines and other oak species) at 1,100-3,000 m (Vidal et al. 1994, Thompson 1995, Ladd and Gass 1999, Rappole et al. 1999, 2000, King et al. 2008, 2012) and oaks appear to be essential in the wintering habitat (Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests in litt. 2018). It was thought to have a wider winter habitat tolerance (and may be tolerant of moderate levels of logging and grazing [Rappole et al. 1999]), but this requires substantiation (J. Sterling in litt. 1999).","Breeding habitat is subject to clearing for land development and agriculture (Ladd and Gass 1999), leading to increased habitat fragmentation, which can impair gene flow (Lindsay et al. 2006, 2008; Athrey et al. 2011), and increase nest predation and brood parasitism (Pulich 1976, Peak 2007, Reidy et al. 2009b, Sperry et al. 2009); thus reducing productivity (Peak and Thompson 2014). Long-term changes in this species's habitat have been documented (Heger 2012, Heger and Hayes in prep.), such that (based on only a portion of the range) potentially 23% of suitable breeding habitat was lost between 1993-94 and 2004-05 and 33% lost from 2004-05 to 2016. Duarte et al. (2013) additionally found a 29% reduction in total breeding habitat between 1999-2001 and 2010-11. Moreover, both Duarte et al. (2016a) and Diamond et al. (2016) found that lost habitat was unlikely to regenerate after a habitat patch was cleared. The 2011 drought and 2015 floods have potentially had an additional impact on habitat loss (Heger and Hayes in prep., Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests in litt. 2018), though these will have been incorporated as part of the Heger and Hayes (in prep) analyses. The 2011 drought also reinforced efforts to try to eradicate Ashe junipers (Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests in litt. 2018). Importantly, habitat loss and fragmentation can lead to reduced connectivity across habitat patches and connectivity has been found to be essential to maintain species viability at both the local (Duarte et al. 2016b) and range-wide scale (Duarte et al. 2016a).The decline may also be being driven by forest fires, logging and firewood-extraction, and agricultural conversion for cattle reducing pine-oak habitats in its wintering range (Ladd and Gass 1999, Rappole et al. 2003a, J. Lyons in litt. 1999, Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests in litt. 2018). Millions of hectares of forest burned between 1998 and 2016, which is equivalent to 33% of total area of the ecoregion (Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests in litt. 2018). It is thought that suitable wintering habitat may be considerably more limited than that available in the breeding range with wintering habitat able to support just 15% of the population that could be supported by breeding habitat (Rappole et al. 2003b). Forest loss throughout this species's entire range is currently estimated at ~3.6% across a ten year period (Tracewski et al. 2016). An infestation of Southern Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis) since 2015, particularly in Honduras, has had a significant impact on forests in the wintering range, increasing the risk of catastrophic fires (Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests in litt. 2018).A range of other factors could also have an influence on the species and its habitat. Predation of incubating females by rat snakes (Elaphe spp.) (and potentially other nest predators [C. Harper in litt. 2016]) appears to be an important contributor to adult mortality, accounting for perhaps 15% of breeding female deaths (Reidy et al. 2009a). White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus), invasive Wild Boar (Sus scrofa), invasive plants and oak wilt fungus (Ceratocystis fagacearum) and increasing wildfire risk may all impact the habitat (Russell and Fowler 1999, Juzwik et al. 2008, USFWS 2014), while Tawny Crazy Ant (Nylanderia fulva) is expanding its range into central Texas, so could be a potential threat (LeBrun et al. 2013, Kumar et al. 2015). Adult mortality from vehicle and window strikes has also been reported (Reidy et al. 2018). Increasing anthropogenic noise, particularly via road construction, has also been considered as a threat however, recent studies have not evidenced any effect from such changes on the species (Lackey et al. 2011; Long et al. 2016, 2017). Climate change is also thought to have significant impacts on the species, as its Ashe juniper dominated woodlands are likely to be unable to shift with shifting climate in the breeding range (EPA 2009), and some tree species in the non-breeding range may contract their range by 50% by 2050 (Goméz-Mendoza and Arriaga 2007). A petition in the state of Texas is also currently attempting to have the species's Endangered species status removed, significantly threatening the habitat in which it resides (USFWS 2016, Doyle 2020).","There is currently only one range-wide estimate of abundance for the species (Mathewson et al. 2012). Mathewson et al. (2012) conducted point count surveys in a subset of randomly selected habitat patches (301 patches total) across the breeding range in 2008–2009 and found density was most related to the predicted patch-specific occupancy probability based on the work of Collier et al. (2012). They estimated range-wide abundance for male birds to be ca. 262,013 (95% CI: 223,131 – 302,620). Using the density estimates of Mathewson et al. (2012), Hatfield et al. (2012) estimated there were ca, 11,600 – 18,300 male birds on conservation, recreation, and Department of Defense lands. Although other density estimates have been calculated for the species (i.e. Peak 2011, USFWS 2014, O’Donnell et al. 2015, Reidy et al. 2015, amongst others), these estimates are based on individual parcels of land and ignore the spatial variability in densities across the breeding range. Regardless, based on the estimates of Peak and Thompson (2013), Sesnie et al. (2016), Reidy et al. (submitted per Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests in litt. 2018) and Groce et al. (2010), the Alliance for Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica estimate that the number of territorial males found on publicly-owned land could be 9,687. The majority of its breeding range is on privately-owned land though, so the overall population size is likely to decline as habitat is lost.",Decreasing,"Setophaga chrysoparia is a neotropical migrant with a restricted breeding range in mature Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei)-mixed oak (Quercus spp.) woodlands of the Edwards Plateau, Lampasas Cut Plain and Central Mineral Region, Texas, USA (Ladd and Gass 1999). A vast range of studies have attempted to estimate the amount of available habitat there is for the species (per Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests in litt. 2018; Pulich 1976; Wahl et al. 1990; DeBoer and Diamond 2006; SWCA 2007; Diamond 2007; Loomis Austin 2008; Morrison et al. 2010; Collier et al. 2010, 2012; Hatfield et al. 2012; Matthewson et al. 2012; Duarte et al. 2013, 2016a; Diamond et al. 2016; Heger and Hayes in prep.). Collier et al. (2012) and Duarte et al. (2013) estimated potential range-wide breeding habitat to be 16,787 km2 and 15,783 km2, respectively. Notably, Collier et al. 2012 used repeated detection/non-detection surveys and spatial occupancy models to account for imperfect detection when estimating patch-specific occupancy probabilities. They estimated that 6,299 km2 of their delineated potential breeding habitat had an occupancy probability of &gt;0.9 and 11,243 km2 of their delineated potential breeding habitat had an occupancy probability of &gt;0.5. Recently, Heger and Hayes (in prep.) estimated that in 2016, there was c.4,560 km2 available breeding habitat however, this is likely to be an overestimate and the Alliance for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Pine-oak Forests in litt. (2018) have estimated the Area of Occupancy during the breeding season to be 1,768 km2.It winters mainly in the mountainous Pine-Oak ecoregion of Central America, from southern Mexico (Chiapas), Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Honduras, where it is uncommon to fairly common (Ladd and Gass 1999, Rappole et al. 2000, Jones and Komar 2007, King et al. 2008). There are recent reports/records from Costa Rica (Garigues 2002) and Panama (Jones and Komar 2006). There is no consensus on the extent of suitable habitat within the species's wintering range, and its ecological integrity has not been established as to assess the conditions required to maintain optimal wintering populations (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica in litt. 2018).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayWithin the breeding range, federal lands that provide long-term protection include Department of Defense lands (U.S. Army Fort Hood, U.S. Air Force Joint Base San Antonio-Camp Bullis, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) and Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica in litt. 2018). Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, Lower Colorado River Authority, The Nature Conservancy, and other cities, counties, and conservation organizations also own lands within the breeding range. Land management practices vary, but many of these lands are managed compatibly for this species (Groce et al. 2010, USFWS 2014). In the USA, it is listed on the Federal Endangered species list and has a recovery plan (USFWS 1992, Ladd and Gass 1999), although there is ongoing action within the state of Texas, despite the efforts of the USFWS, to have such Endangered species status removed (USFWS 2016, Doyle 2020). Several regional habitat conservation plans have been approved or are under development (Ladd and Gass 1999, J. Lyons in litt. 1999), including the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve in western Travis County (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica in litt. 2018). Control of invasive species is being attempted in the breeding range, e.g. in Balcones Canyonlands Preserve (W. Reiner and J. Scalise in litt. 2018). Efforts to protect the wintering range include the Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica, which was formed in 2003, and consists of institutions located in the United States, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The Alliance (2008) developed a conservation plan for the ecoregion with the goal of conserving pine-oak forest habitat. This conservation plan represents the first regional management, conservation, and sustainable development effort for pine-oak forests with the purpose of promoting and sustaining biodiversity, water, timber, recreation, and sustainable rural development (USFWS 2014).Since the species was listed on the Federal Endangered species list, habitat mapping, population monitoring, and viability analyses have increased our knowledge of species distribution, habitat requirements, and threats within the breeding range (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica in litt. 2018). In 2017, the Department of Defense and USFWS initiated efforts to track movements between the breeding and wintering range using geolocators (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica in litt. 2018). Surveys in 2006-10 and 2014-8 have improved knowledge of its wintering distribution and trends (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica in litt. 2018). Several Private Conservation Banks have been established to protect habitat for the species.Conservation Actions ProposedProvide permanent protection of large blocks of breeding habitat (USFWS 2014, Duarte et al. 2016a, C. Harper in litt. 2016). Ensure Endangered species status is retained. Restore connectivity within breeding population to promote gene flow (Lindsay et al. 2006) and maintain local populations (Duarte et al. 2016b), and more generally restore and reforest priority areas throughout its range (e.g. Alliance for the Conservation of the Pine-Oak Forests of Mesoamerica 2017). Protect enough habitat in the breeding, migrating, and wintering habitat to support viable populations (USFWS 2014). Manage habitat throughout the range such that woodland and forest regeneration occurs and persists over the long term (USFWS 2014). Promote sustainable forest management with ecological criteria for firewood and charcoal in natural forests and plantations (Alliance for the Conservation of the Pine-Oak Forests of Mesoamerica 2017). Develop plans for integrated fire management in priority areas (Alliance for the Conservation of the Pine-Oak Forests of Mesoamerica 2017). Implement measures to alleviate threats. Control invasive species that may be impacting this species. Monitor demographic parameters across the breeding range to evaluate population viability over time (Duarte et al. 2016a). Monitor winter distribution and habitat quality. Assess the conditions required to maintain optimal wintering populations (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica in litt. 2018). Evaluate the ecological role of fire and the effects of climate change on pine and oak forests (Alliance for the Conservation of the Pine-Oak Forests of Mesoamerica 2017). Provide education and outreach throughout the range (USFWS 2014), and promote legislation to help protect the species at all scales (Alliance for the Conservation of Pine-Oak Forests in Mesoamerica in litt. 2018).",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global
181151405,22697636,Gymnogyps californianus,Critically Endangered,C2a(i); D,2020,2020-08-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"After the removal of all surviving birds into captivity in 1987, an intensive conservation programme involving reintroduction and release of captive-bred birds has led to a small but increasing population of this species in the wild. However, the population in the wild remains dependent on intensive conservation management efforts. The population currently numbers 93 mature individuals, with 62 mature individuals in the largest subpopulation and as a result, it currently meets the threshold for listing as Endangered. However, the population only increased sufficiently above the threshold for listing as Critically Endangered in 2019, hence the species continues to be listed as Critically Endangered under the five-year rule. Should such population increases continue, it will warrant downlisting in 2024.","Its range includes rocky, open-country scrubland, coniferous forest and oak savanna. Cavities in ledges on cliffs, rocky outcrops or in large trees are used as nest sites (USFWS 1996). It scavenges on the carcasses of large mammals and also feeds on the carcasses of small mammals. California ground squirrels are a documented small mammal food source in California and a source of lead poisoning as they are routinely shot as nuisance animals on private ranges. Investigations into the amount of small mammal use as a food source in the Arizona/Utah population is ongoing (S. Kirkland in litt. 2020). Relative to foraging, released birds reach independence soon after release, and may range more than 400 km from release sites (Anon. 1998), though the distance an individual ranges can vary depending on season and individuals released at different sites have shown significantly different home range sizes (Rivers et al. 2014), suggesting local ecological factors may play a role.","The drastic population decline during the 20th century is principally attributed to persecution and accidental ingestion of fragments and residues from lead bullets and lead shot from carcasses (C. N. Parish in litt. 2012), resulting in lead poisoning. Lead poisoning remains a key threat and the leading cause of death for released birds (Rideout et al. 2012, Kelly et al. 2014) and has caused many fatalities and resulted in the treatment of many more birds (Anon. 2001, Parish et al. 2007, Walters et al. 2010). As a result of their life history strategy, characterised by high adult survival, long life expectancy, and low reproductive rates, condor populations are particularly sensitive to lead poisoning, which severely impacts adult survival; lead can build up initially in the blood, but then in the bone and tissues to dangerous levels over longer periods having been ingested over a broad area (Hunt et al. 2007, S. Kirkland in litt. 2020). Lead poisoning therefore continues to be the principal threat to condors and at current levels threaten the long-term sustainability of reintroduced populations (Cade 2007, Finkelstein et al. 2012, Rideout et al. 2012). It was reported in 2009 that over 90% of condors released in Arizona still test positive for lead (Toops 2009) whilst Rideout et al. (2012) determined that lead toxicosis was the leading, identifiable cause of death in juvenile (26% of deaths where the cause could be determined) and adult (67%) free-ranging California Condors since the inception of the reintroduction program in 1992. A study conducted in California, using samples collected in 2004-2009, suggests that around one third of condors have blood lead values associated with toxicological effects based on inhibition of the heme biosyntheticenzyme δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (Finkelstein et al. 2012). Sequential feather samples have been used to reconstruct a condor’s lead exposure history over the 3-4-month time frame of feather growth and this data demonstrates that condors are exposed to lead more frequently, and at higher levels than indicated by blood monitoring data (Finkelstein et al. 2010, 2012). A study using samples collected between 1997 and 2011 showed that blood lead concentrations increased as birds became less reliant on provisioned food, as they became older and as their home range size increased (Kelly et al. 2014) and Bakker et al. (2017) found that condor survivorship was negatively related to time spent feeding on provisioned food. In 2017, 69 of the 78 birds in the Arizona/Utah population showed high levels of lead exposure; despite a treatment, two individuals died from severe lead-poisoning (Vulture Specialist Group 2017).The population along the Central Pacific Californian coast also suffers from reduced eggshell thickness, consistent with the effects of DDE exposure, a breakdown compound of the pesticide DDT, compromising reproduction in the wild (Burnett et al. 2013). Apparently restricted to condors feeding on the coast, DDE exposure has been linked to feeding on the carcasses of California Sea Lions that had been exposed to the pesticide during their lifetimes (Kurle et al. 2016). The lack of additional DDT inputs suggests that these effects will decrease over time, though at present this is an impediment to sustainable wild reproduction in the coastal population. Ingested anthropogenic material has been responsible for the deaths of nestlings and strongly implicated in a number of other nestling deaths. The dead condors were found to have swallowed significant quantities of micro-trash (e.g. glass fragments, wire, plastic cartridge cases, etc.) and Rideout et al. (2012) observed this to be the leading cause of death in nestlings (76% of identifiable causes); micro-trash has however, recently been observed not to be significant source of lead poisoning and that the vast majority of lead micro-trash items were related to lead-ammunition (Finkelstein et al. 2015). Shooting still occurs and is often identified in live birds that have been radiographed during lead testing or in relation to other injuries. Eleven birds have been killed as a result of being shot since 1998 (USFWS 2019, unpublished data).Puppet-reared birds were initially thought to exhibit greater problematic human-oriented behaviour, such as tameness and vandalising property, than parent-reared birds (Meretsky et al. 2000). However, there is no apparent difference in mortality between released birds that were puppet-reared and those which were parent-reared (Woods et al. 2007). Clark et al. (2007) modified puppet rearing practices to try and address concerns with initial captive reared birds. Wallace et al. (2007) compared the post-release results of birds reared with modified puppet rearing techniques in an isolated population in Baja, Mexico, with those released in the United States and evidenced that changes in socialisation techniques of young captive reared birds largely alleviated early problems with captive reared birds. At present, condors in the current wild subpopulations are not entirely immune to some interactions with human structures (i.e. perching on communication towers, mountain homes, South rim of the Grand Canyon) and behavioural modifications including attempts to haze them when possible are still employed. Cade et al. (2004) identified three types of interactions with humans and human structures where Type 1 and 2 were acceptable, while Type 3 was considered unacceptable and associated with birds showing no fear of humans, approaching them with no escape route. These categories remain the general benchmarks for the Recovery Program in determining whether or not a condor is exhibiting problematic behaviour and few condors are now removed from the wild due to behavioural problems. In the early 1990s a number of captive-reared birds were lost owing to collisions with power-lines and a conditioning programme with mock power poles was initiated to address it (L. Kiff in litt. 2005). This practice has since been adopted in the field to help avoid power pole electrocutions in wild-fledged condors. However, collisions and subsequent electrocution following mid-span collisions continue to periodically occur. Seventeen total cases of electrocution have been documented since 1993, including several in 2015, 2016 and 2019, with lead poisoning being identified as a cofactor in at least one of these deaths (USFWS 2019, unpublished data).  The spread of west Nile virus has not been a significant problem for the species as most birds are still vaccinated (L. Kiff in litt. 2005) however, as the wild population continues to grow, it is anticipated that it will not remain feasible to vaccinate all wild nestlings. Therefore, efforts to understand the potential significance of west Nile virus on the recovery of the species are under way. Lead poisoning however, continues to represent the most significant known cause of mortality in the wild; approximately 50% of all deaths with a determined cause are lead poisoning (USFWS 2019, unpublished data). The effect of treating individual birds for lead poisoning is currently being studied to assess whether it has any effect on survivorship in the wild California population (S. Kirkland in litt. 2020). Currently, the population would not continue to grow without the continued release of captive-bred birds.","There are currently 201 adults in the wild that are old enough to breed (age 5 and older), and 93 have produced viable offspring. Twenty-three wild birds turned five years old in 2019 and 17 more will turn five years old in 2020.  A total of 141 wild birds are 8 years old or older, the observed average age of productivity (i.e. producing young when greater than or equal to eight years of age). Since mature individuals (as defined by IUCN) only includes individuals in the wild that are currently capable of reproduction, and re-introduced individuals must have produced viable offspring before they are counted as mature individuals, the current global population sensu IUCN is 93 mature individuals as of March 2020 (USFWS California Condor Recovery Program, unpublished data).",Increasing,"This species declined rapidly throughout its historic range from British Columbia to Baja California during the 19th century and reportedly disappeared from outside California, U.S.A., in 1937 (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, L. Kiff in litt. 2009). The population had dropped to an all-time low of just 22 birds by 1981, and in 1983 eggs were first taken from wild nests for captive-rearing; in 1987 the species became extinct in the wild when the last of the six wild individuals was captured to join a captive-breeding recovery programme involving 27 birds (Wilbur and Kiff 1980, Toops 2009). Due to intensive captive breeding and reintroduction efforts the population increased to 223 birds by August 2003, comprising 138 in captivity, and 85 reintroduced in California and northern Arizona (L. Kiff in litt. 2003). Breeding in the wild resumed in 2002 and now occurs in all wild subpopulations (California, Arizona/Utah and Baja, Mexico).The sub-population in California comprises 200 wild individuals in two distinct but loosely intermixing flocks. The Southern Californian flock is managed by the USFWS Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge Condor Recovery staff and the Central California flock is managed collectively by the Ventana Wildlife Society and Pinnacles National Park. Each of the California flocks includes approximately 100 free flying individuals as of December 31st 2019 (S. Kirkland in litt. 2020). The Arizona sub-population includes 98 free-flying individuals and there are an additional 39 free-flying individuals in the Baja, Mexico subpopulation. The combined total wild population as of December 2019 stands at 337 with an additional 181 captive individuals, for a total world population of 518. The regular movements of the Arizona birds are mostly confined to Coconnino County (Arizona) and Kane County (Utah), although several individuals have been documented wandering in Wyoming, southwestern Colorado and New Mexico before returning to the Vermilion Cliffs release area (C. N. Parish in litt. 2020). The California birds occur regularly in Ventura, Kern, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Monterrey, San Benito, Tulare and Fresno Counties. Currently, range expansion has been documented as far north as Alameda County in the west and Madera County in the east along the foothills of the Central Sierra Nevada Mountains. The species's geographic range continues to expand as the population grows in size (Bakker et al. 2017).The reintroduction programme continues and has expanded its geographic coverage, with six birds released into the Sierra de San Pedro Martir in Baja California, Mexico in 2002 (USFWS 2002). A release site in Baja was established in October 2003. The first chick hatched in Mexico for over 75 years hatched in April 2007. The Baja California birds are largely confined to the Sierra de San Pedro Martir (L. Kiff in litt. 2006), where release efforts are ongoing to augment the wild population; these birds have continued to expand their range and have reached both the Pacific and Gulf of California coasts (S. Kirkland in litt. 2020). It is hoped these birds will range widely enough to be effectively connected with birds in the southern U.S.A., and a bird from the Baja population was seen in San Diego County in April 2007. Second generation birds have matured to breeding age and wild fledged pairs have now fledged their own chicks into the wild however, no population can be deemed sustainable, and without substantial reductions in the use of lead-based ammunition within the condor's range, none are likely to become so (Finkelstein et al. 2012). The recovery programme for the species continues to address threats to the wild population, but lead contamination remains the greatest of these threats (Finkelstein et al. 2012, Bakker et al. 2017); lead poisoning represents approximately 50 percent of all known causes of death in the total population (S. Kirkland in litt. 2020).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I and II. A large-scale, integrated captive-breeding programme, managed by the Peregrine Fund (at the World Center for Birds of Prey), Los Angeles Zoo, Oregon Zoo, San Diego Wild Animal Park and Chapultepec Zoo, Mexico City, and reintroduction program, managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ventana Wildlife Society, Peregrine Fund, Pinnacles National Park and Government of Mexico, is maintaining and growing the population in the wild (USFWS 2019). The success of the captive breeding program has seen an increase from one chick hatched in 1988 to approximately 30 birds produced for release to the wild annually. The genetic diversity of the population is maintained through careful distribution and representation of founder genotypes at each captive-breeding facility and reintroduction site. Consequently the current population retains 99.5% of the likely heterozygosity of a wild panmictic population (Ralls and Ballou 2004). 'Aversion training' to avoid power poles appears successful in preventing electrocution from perching on power poles and is ongoing (S. Kirkland in litt. 2020). Condors still periodically collide with powerlines during flight hence California power companies have buried and replaced some above ground power lines with insulated lines in areas with high levels of condor activity; insulated lines protect condors from electrocution following mid-span collision and anecdotally may be more visible to the birds since they are darker and slightly thicker (S. Kirkland in litt. 2020). A total of 287 condors were released into the wild between 1992 and 2019 (USFWS 2019, unpublished data). Clean carcasses are provided for reintroduced birds to supplement the food they would otherwise receive from their parents in the wild, and to assist in trapping to replace transmitters, test for lead, and assess general health. Education programs aim to minimise persecution and educate the public about the conservation benefits of using non-lead ammunition for hunting and land management (Hunting with non-lead 2020, North American Non-lead Partnership 2020). However, as the recovery of the species has continued, individuals are now ranging further than when the population was younger and smaller, and are less likely to take the food provided for them after age two (Bakker et al. 2017). A huge step has been taken towards trying to eliminate the threat of lead-poisoning with the signing in 2007 of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, and Assembly Bill 711 which requires the use of non-lead ammunition for the taking of all wildlife species throughout the state of California; lead-based ammunition can however, still be used for the putting down of livestock, impacting condors that frequent livestock ranch lands for foraging (A. Brickey in litt. 2020). The effectiveness of these regulatory bans on the survivorship and recovery of the species remains to be seen. Meanwhile, there is a growing program to promote the use of non-lead ammunition in hunting and wildlife management. The Ventana Wildlife Society, Arizona Game and Fish Department and Utah Division of Wildlife Resources are distributing non-lead bullets free of charge to hunters within the foraging range of the condors. In 2008 an agreement was struck between the Tejon Ranch and five conservation organisations in California to preserve 240,000 acres of the 270,000 acre property as an open space in return for not opposing the development of the remaining land, providing a vast amount of foraging habitat for the condor (L. Kiff in litt. 2009). This conservation program has certainly reduced the amount of lead available to condors, as larger and larger percentage of the Southern California flock continue to forage there, however this area only represents approximately 2.5 % of the 9,600,000 acre geographic range this flock occupies. The North American Non-lead Partnership is engaging State Wildlife Management Agencies, to promote the voluntary use of non-lead ammunition as a traditional wildlife management practice that benefits non-target trust wildlife resources by eliminating secondary poisoning from the ingestion of spent lead ammunition.  A willing partnership between hunting and endangered species conservation that facilitates a cultural shift away from hunting with traditional lead ammunition, may be the most practical way a significant reduction in the use of lead ammunition is likely to occur.  Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor population trends. Revise the recovery plan using updated population modeling (Bakker et al. 2017) and management information, to determine survivorship and demographic parameters for a self sustaining population of condors. Resume release programme in Mexico and establish new release sites in northern California. Maintain and increase the productivity of the captive population. Continue releases of captive-bred birds. Maintain suitable habitat (USFWS 1996, Anon. 1998).  Continue supplemental feeding as a food source for newly reintroduced birds and to maintain suitable flock behaviors and facilities for population management and maintenance. Continue and expand information and education programmes (USFWS 1996, Anon. 1998, Walters et al. 2010). Continue supplying alternative lead-free ammunition to hunters and ranchers.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
181242855,22692156,Grus americana,Endangered,D,2020,2020-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Endangered because it has a very small population. However, the conservation status of the species is improving, with not only increases in the natural wild population but also establishment of reintroduced flocks that may become self-sustaining. As a result, the number of mature individuals is continuing to increase and this species may merit downlisting to Vulnerable in the near future.","It breeds in prairie wetlands, preferring small, shallow lakes and ponds, willow communities, marshes, mudflats and perhaps sedge meadows, but this may be atypical considering its historical range (Archibald and Meine 1996, Timoney 1999). Eggs are laid from late April to mid-May (Archibald and Meine 1996). It winters in coastal brackish wetlands. For the wild population winter mortality appears to be correlated with blue crab availability at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, with higher mortality in years of lower crab abundance (Pugesek et al. 2013). The natural population are known to feed on beetles, crabs/crayfish, vegetation, seeds, molluscs and other vertebrates with introduced populations thought to feed on largely the same sources alongside benthic invertebrates, and amphibians and reptiles (Dinets 2016, Caven et al. 2019, Neri 2020). Stopover sites typically comprise wetland land-cover types and lowland grasslands (Baasch et al. 2019).","Over-hunting, habitat conversion and human disturbance were the main causes of the species's decline. Currently, the most significant known cause of death or injury to fledglings is collision with powerlines (Lewis 1997). Powerline markers can reduce collisions by 50-80%, but most powerlines remain unmarked and collision is a major and growing problem (Lewis 1997, Folk et al. 2013); 45 powerline collision-related mortalities were recorded between 1956-2006 (Stehn and Wassenich 2008, Smith 2019. The anticipated placement of thousands of wind turbines in the migration corridor will decrease availability of crane stopover habitat and may also dramatically increase the number of powerlines (T. Stehn in litt. 2007). Increases in the number of powerlines also stems from increased oil and gas exploration along parts of the species's migration corridor whilst activity and traffic associated with drilling may also be of significant detriment (Niemuth et al. 2018). In 2007, a lightning strike during severe weather killed 17 captive-bred young birds being housed in a top-netted release pen in Florida (T. Stehn in litt. 2007). Eggs and pre-fledged chicks are subject to predation by various birds and mammals including raven, bald eagle, wolf, black bear and lynx (CWS and USFWS 2007), while harassment of nesting individuals by parasites such as black flies can lead to nest abandonment, and this has been proposed as a key reason for failed breeding in one of the introduced populations (Runge et al. 2011, Barzen et al. 2018). Drought is a serious threat to the species as it is detrimental to all habitats utilized by this species, but is especially harmful by dramatically decreasing production on the nesting grounds (RENEW report 1999, Butler et al. 2014). In early 2009, a prolonged drought and reduced water inflow to coastal wetlands led to a reduction in availability of blue crabs Callinectes sapidus and wolfberries Lycium spp. (important food items), causing Whooping Crane mortality rates to double (Archibold 2009). Drought, and alteration and destruction of natural wetlands and rivers impacts roosting and foraging sites during migration (Niemuth et al. 2018, Baasch et al. 2019) whilst coastal development, sea level rise, climate change, chemical spills, reduced fresh water inflows, and human disturbance threaten the Texan wintering grounds (RENEW report 1999, CWS and USFWS 2007). Aransas National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) can only support a maximum of 500 birds through the winter (T. Stehn in litt. 2007) and falls short of the initial downlisting target of 1,000 birds. Continued population growth may force some cranes in future to use disturbed and suboptimal habitat (M. Reid in litt. 2003). Much of the currently unoccupied crane habitat at Aransas where the cranes would be expected to expand into is being threatened with construction of houses (T. Stehn, in litt. 2007). There are currently concerns about oil spills and river inflows to Aransas NWR (CWS and USFWS 2007), as well as reduced water flows in the central Platte River Ralley, Nebraska, a key stopover site for migrating Whooping Cranes (Chavez-Ramirez 2008). The spread of West Nile virus and avian influenza in the future may pose a threat to the species (Chu et al. 2003). The long-term effects of genetic drift after a severe population bottleneck are unknown (Glenn et al. 1999, Smith 2019) There have been incidences of illegal shooting of the species and it is known to be an increasing threat with 27 confirmed shooting mortalities between 1967 and 2016 (MacKenzie 2011, Shaw 2011, Condon et al. 2018, Niemuth et al. 2018, Smith 2019).","The total population in the wild numbers c.483 individuals. However, the only self-sustaining population breeding in Northwest Territories/Alberta, Canada and wintering in Texas, USA numbers 329 individuals, fewer than 250 of which are mature. Hence we retain a precautionary estimate of 50-249 mature individuals. Despite this however, the latest evidence from the Crane Conservation Strategy (Smith 2019) suggests that both the self-sustaining Aransas-Wood Buffalo population and additional reintroduced populations have increased notably in recent years and that the current population estimate may now be a considerable underestimate.",Increasing,"Grus americana declined from historic estimates of &gt;10,000 prior to European settlement of North America to 1,300-1,400 birds by 1870, and only 15 adults in 1938 (CWS and USFWS 2007). As of 2016/17 there are four wild populations totalling c.483 individuals, including three reintroduced populations in the eastern U.S. that are not yet self-sustaining. The only natural wild population breeds in Wood Buffalo National Park, on the border of Northwest Territories and Alberta, Canada, and winters at and near to Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, Texas, U.S.A. (Meine and Archibald 1996) (although in 2011-2012 they were observed up to hundreds of kilometres away from here [Wright et al. 2014]). It totalled 266 birds in 2007 (T. Stehn in litt. 2007), with 65 active nests (B. Johns in litt. 2007), followed by a record 270 birds in spring 2008 (Archibald 2009), dropping to 247 in spring 2009 (Archibald 2009) following a drought in the wintering quarters in Texas. As of winter 2015-2016 this population contained 329 individuals, including 122 adult pairs (Butler and Harrell 2016). A reintroduced, non-migratory flock in Florida numbered c.41 individuals in 2007, but due to lack of reproductive success and high mortality rates this project was discontinued in 2007 (T. Stehn in litt. 2007, W. Harrell in litt. 2016). This population contains a dozen or less individuals (H. Ray in litt. 2016). A separate reintroduced flock migrates between Wisconsin and south-eastern USA. This population numbered 75 birds in 2007 (T. Stehn in litt. 2007), increasing to c.90 birds in 2008 (Stehn 2008), and as of January 2017 the population numbers 104 individuals (Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership 2017). The first wild born chick fledged in Wisconsin and migrated successfully in 2006 (T. Stehn in litt. 2007) and another wild born chick hatched in June 2009 (Garland and Peterson 2009).

A U.S. District Court has ruled to restrict water offtake from the Guadalupe River, Texas, as so much water was being taken it was a breach of the Endangered Species Act against this species (Beilfuss 2013). There is an international recovery plan (CWS and USFWS 2007) focusing on increasing the size of the natural flock, establishing additional wild populations through experimental releases, teaching captive-bred birds to migrate (Lewis 1995, Line 1995, RENEW report 1999), and increasing the captive population for experimental releases and ecological research (e.g. habitat selection). Considerable progress has been made in improving the genetic health of captive stock and in breeding under-represented genetic strains, but delayed reproduction in captivity and the failure of some pairs to breed at all has slowed down progress (Putman 2007). In the past, recruitment was increased in certain years in Canada by removal of a single egg from two-egg broods (Boyce et al. 2005); the removed eggs are used to supplement captive flocks, but the overall impact of the egg pickup program is largely undetermined (CWS and USFWS 2007). An eastern migratory population which mostly winters in Florida and summers in Wisconsin has now been established but only four instances of successful breeding has been recorded so far (J. Hook in litt. 2007, Garland and Peterson 2009, H. Ray in litt. 2016). If passed, the Crane Conservation Act (H.R. 1771 and S. 1048) would allocate $5 million per year over five years to be spent on crane conservation efforts world-wide, with strict limitations on the amount going to help Whooping Cranes. A process has been initiated as a collaborative project to conduct a Population Viability Analysis and a Population and Habitat Viability Assessment to aid in the recovery of this species (Harrell and Bidwell 2015).Conservation Actions Proposed Survey and monitor breeding grounds to determine nesting effort (RENEW report 1999), and the wintering grounds to determine flock size.

Individuals congregate in the Yukon-Kuskokwin Delta in August and migrate south, mostly bypassing the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands to make landfall after 6,000 km or more (Marks and Redmond 1994b, Gill 1999). The species winters on coral reefs, sandy beaches, intertidal flats, rocky shores and in palm forests and dense vegetated understorey (Gill 1999, R. E. Gill in litt. 1999, 2003). It is long-lived (15-23 years), forms long-term monogamous pairs, and is highly faithful to breeding and wintering sites (Gill 1999).","On the non-breeding grounds in Polynesia, introduced predators, especially dogs, but in the past also cats and possibly pigs, are predating flightless birds (P.

Raust in litt. 2012). Hunting for food is occurring localised, particularly in the Tuamotus, and recent reports suggest it may also be a threat in the Marshall Islands, Carolines, US Minor Outlying Islands and Hawaiian offshore islands (G. Allport in litt. 2006). In recent years, hunting for food has however considerably declined in Polynesia or even stopped entirely (P. Raust in litt. 2019, E. VanderWerf in litt. 2020). Ingestion of lead paint on Midway Island needs to be investigated (it was recently identified as a problem in seabirds) (R. E.

It is also threatened by the degradation and loss of wetland habitat through environmental pollution, land reclamation (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Barter 2006), urbanisation (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and a reduction in the amount of sediment being carried into coastal areas by rivers (Barter 2006).

Partners in Flight (2019) however, estimate a larger population of 31,000 mature individuals hence, the population is placed here in the range 24,000-31,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Charadrius nivosus is a widespread partial migrant in North America, Central America, western South America and the Caribbean, where it occupies coastal habitats and inland, usually saline waterbodies (del Hoyo et al. 1996). A recent study by Thomas et al. (2012) estimated the total North American population to be 25,869 breeding individuals, with approximately 42% of the breeding population in North America residing at two sites; Great Salt Lake, Utah, and Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge, Oklahoma. Saalfeld et al. (2013) compared survey counts of adult C. nivosus between 1999-2000 and 2008-2009 on two lakes in the Southern High Plains of Texas that support a large proportion of the regional population, and showed that they decreased by 78% at one saline lake (from 80 adults/survey to 8 adults/survey), although they remained constant at another lake (from 45 adults/survey to 41 adults/survey).  At a small breeding site in southern Colorado, USA, individuals during the breeding season declined from 141 adults to 37 adults between 2007 and 2015 (BLM, unpublished data).","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation and research actions underwayManagement information Shallowly flooding a previously dry habitat at Owens Lake, California, was found to attract more breeding pairs to the area and had the effect of extending the nesting season by c.1 month (Ruhlen et al. 2006). At Batiquitos Lagoon, California, creating new nesting areas from dredging spoils (e.g. coarse-grained sand and shell fragments) attracted more breeding pairs and non-breeding individuals, possibly because the new areas were covered with less debris and a smaller amount of tall vegetation than older sites (Powell and Collier 2000). In the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge, Oklahoma, there is evidence that nests adjacent to herbaceous and shrub vegetation suffer significantly lower losses to flooding but significantly higher losses to mammalian predation than those 500 or 1,000 m away (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). In the same area artificial nest ridges (made by ploughing) and nest mounds constructed from existing materials (gravel, sand and clay) were found not to reduce nest flooding (Koenen et al. 1996a). Predator exclusion experiments from nesting areas using electric fences in the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge, Oklahoma (Koenen et al. 1996a) and in Monterey Bay, California were unsuccessful in increasing the number of chicks fledged per male (Neuman et al. 2004) or significantly reducing annual egg predation (this was probably still limited by avian predation) (Koenen et al. 1996a), although in Monterey Bay the hatching success of nests within the exclosure did increase (Neuman et al. 2004) and the overall nesting success was higher for breeding pairs within the Salt Plains National Wildlife Refuge exclosures (Koenen et al. 1996a). At Monterey Bay the predator exclosures were also not successful in increasing adult breeding numbers, and the mortality of incubating adults was actually higher within the enclosures than outside them (Neuman et al. 2004). In coastal Oregon, habitat management to remove invasive grasses and provide more suitable nesting substrate more than doubled nest survival whilst nest exclosures and predator management also increased nesting success in both Oregon and Washington also (Dinsmore et al. 2014, 2017); such changes were not correlated with changes in other population viability factors, such as fledging success however (Dinsmore et al. 2014). Furthermore, lethal predator removal and reduced human disturbance were shown to facilitate population recovery and alleviate the reliance upon immigration in a sink population in northern California, although nest exclosures were shown to reduce population growth due to their compromising impact on adult survival (Eberhart-Phillips and Colwell 2014). Pearson et al. (2016) have also noted both the benefits of nest exclosures on nesting success but also their negative influence on adult survival in populations in coastal Washington (2006-2012). Gaines et al. (2020) documented the increase in adult survival throughout Snowy Plovers in Oregon between 1990-2014 following the removal of nest exclosures and initiation of lethal predator removal. On beaches in Santa Barbara, California, erecting protective barriers to direct tourist foot-traffic away from sections of upper beach was found to decrease disturbance of the species by more than half and attracted increased numbers of breeding pairs, although the distribution of the species on the beach contracted to within the protected area (Lafferty et al. 2006).Conservation and research actions proposedCarry out systematic monitoring in breeding areas and wintering sites.

It requires the presence of features offering perches, shade, nest-sites and accessible food. It is frequently found around villages and in traditionally farmed areas (Krištín and Kirwan 2015). The species is monogamous, solitary and a territorial breeder, although extra-pair paternity has been found in southeast Spain. It nests in natural holes in stumps, trees, walls, old buildings, cliffs, among boulders, in abandoned vehicles, drainpipes, wells, roof spaces and nest boxes and may use the same site for several seasons (Krištín and Kirwan 2015). The nest may be unlined or lined with moss, grass, leaves or pine needles (Snow and Perrins 1998) and is normally relatively close to the ground but occasionally found over 40 m (Krištín and Kirwan 2015). Typically lays seven to eight eggs. It feeds almost entirely on animal matter, primarily large insects and their larvae and pupae (Snow and Perrins 1998). Northern populations are fully migratory while others are only partially migratory or sedentary.","The species is hunted in the Mediterranean region, Kuwait and in parts of south-east Asia (Krištín and Kirwan 2015). Hunting and disturbance in the northern Malay Peninsula may have resulted in recent declines (Krištín and Kirwan 2015). Food quality and accessibility has been shown to affect reproductive success (Martin-Vivaldi et al. 1999, Fournier and Arlettaz 2001) as has the availability of suitable nesting cavities (Arlettaz et al. 2000) as a result of habitat changes after agricultural intensification (Bauer and Berthold 1997).","The overall population is estimated at 5,000,000-10,000,000 individuals (Krištín and Kirwan 2015).

Numbers exceeded 500 singing males in 1994 following doubling of suitably aged habitat between 1987 and 1990. Numbers continue to increase, but its population remains small, hence its classification as Near Threatened. Should current trends continue, the species may be eligible for downlist in the near future.","Its optimal breeding habitat is large (&gt;80 acres), fire-maintained homogeneous stands of 1-5 m tall jack pines Pinus banksiana on sandy soil (Mayfield 1992; Sykes 1997; Anon. 2008). However, greater than 75% of habitat is now planted through species-specific management efforts (Donner et al. 2008). Birds arrive to the breeding grounds from early May to early June (Rockwell et al. 2012; Cooper et al. 2017) and eggs are laid in late May and June (Curson et al. 1994) with hatching occurring ~14 days later and fledglings leaving the nest in July (Bocetti et al. 2020). Birds depart on fall migration from late September through late October (Cooper et al. 2017). It winters in early-successional disturbed habitat (Wunderle et al. 2010) consisting of natural and secondary scrub, and saline/upland ecotone (Sykes and Clench 1998; Wunderle et al. 2010, 2014). Stands of Caribbean pine, P. caribbaena were believed to be important winter habitat (Haney et al. 1998), but more recent surveys indicate that warblers use almost exclusively scrub habitats (Cooper et al. 2019a). It feeds on arthropods and abundant fruit during winter (Wunderle et al. 2010, 2014). Some birds move from patch to patch in the wintering grounds as food supplies are depleted and areas dry out, eventually concentrating in small patches where they maintain small and overlapping home ranges (Wunderle et al. 2014). Following dry winters, birds arrive relatively late on the breeding grounds, which is associated with lower reproductive success and survival (Rockwell et al. 2012, 2017).","Loss of breeding habitat was the major threat that led to their near extinction, but this threat has been eliminated following decades of habitat creation. Parasitism by brown-headed Cowbird Molothrus ater was also a major threat in breeding areas (Sykes and Clench 1998). However, because of declining cowbird populations in Michigan, parasitism by cowbirds is not currently a threat. The cause of declines in the cowbird population is not understood and if cowbird populations increase, parasitism may again become a major threat (Cooper et al. 2019b). A cowbird trapping program was reduced between 2015-2017 and then suspended in 2018-2019 due to this decline in cowbird populations and parasitism is currently ~1% (Cooper et al. 2019b). Wintering area threats include droughts and habitat disturbances that eliminate early successional habitats with favoured fruit plants (J. M. Wunderle in litt. 2016). Studies have demonstrated that late winter droughts can eliminate fruit, causing reduction in warbler body condition, annual survival and reduced reproductive success in Michigan (Rockwell et al. 2012; Wunderle et al. 2014; Rockwell et al. 2017). Climate change is a major concern in wintering grounds, especially the potential increase in late winter drought conditions and sea level rise, which threatens the warbler’s coastal habitats as well as limiting availability of freshwater required by warbler’s fruit plants (J. M. Wunderle in litt. 2016; Wolcott et al. 2018; Cooper et al. 2019a); reductions in wintering ground precipitation and hence, habitat quality have been modelled to drive significant S. kirtlandii population declines through carry-over effects (Brown et al. 2017, 2019). Climate change however presents less of a threat in breeding grounds, where conditions are likely to remain largely suitable for jack pine occupancy in the near future (Donner et al. 2018).","The population size increased beginning in 1990, with latest estimates from 2015 putting it at around 2,365 singing males (Michigan Department of Natural Resources 2015). The population is estimated at 4,500-5,000 mature individuals (D. Ewert in litt. 2016), which equates to 6,750-7,500 individuals, rounded here to 6,800-7,500 individuals.",Increasing,"Almost the entire population of Setophaga kirtlandii breeds in north and central Michigan (Anon. 2008), with small numbers breeding in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and Wisconsin, U.S.A. and Ontario, Canada (Eskelsen 2007; Richard 2013, 2014). Breeding habitat underwent significant past declines, but is now considerably more extensive than the 18 km2 occupied in 1994 (Nelson and Buech 1996). It has a small winter range in the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos Islands (to U.K.), and Cuba; recent studies demonstrate that most overwinter in the central Bahamas islands of Eleuthera, San Salvador, Cat and Long Islands (Cooper et al. 2017, 2019a). There were major declines in c.1900-1920 and 1961-1971 (Haney et al. 1998), with the population numbering just 167 singing males in 1974 and 1987 (Anon. 1996). Numbers have recovered to 2,365 singing males in Michigan, Wisconsin and Ontario in 2015 (Michigan Department of Natural Resources 2015), the highest since surveys began in 1951 (National Wildlife Refuge Association in litt. 2006); 97.5% of the singing males were in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Migration routes were recently described, with important stopover areas in Florida, Georgia, Ohio and along the coasts of North and South Carolina (Cooper et al. 2017). Finally, it was recently determined that the species exhibits weak migratory connectivity between wintering and breeding grounds, with individuals wintering on any one island migrating to locations across the entire breeding range (Cooper et al. 2018).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions Underway CMS Appendix I. Management replicating the effects of natural fires has expanded potential breeding habitat considerably to c.120 km2 (N. Cooper in litt. 2020). Efforts are underway to expand the breeding range outside of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan by increasing the size of existing populations in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ontario. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the United States Forest Service have signed agreements to continue habitat creation (USFWS and MDNR 2015; USFWS et al. 2016). Since 1972, a cowbird trapping programme has reduced parasitism from 70% to 1% (Cooper et al. 2019b). The trapping program was reduced from 2015 to 2017, and eventually suspended in 2018 with no associated increase in the rate of parasitism. The cowbird programme is currently shifting towards a monitoring focus, to ensure that if and when the cowbird population increases to a dangerous level, managers will be aware and can reinstate the trapping programme. Modeling efforts are underway to determine the maximum level of parasitism that the population could withstand and remain sustainable (N. W. Cooper pers. comm). Education and ecotourism initiatives in Michigan include an annual Kirtland's Warbler Festival (Richter 1996). Surveys have been undertaken in the Bahamas since 1998 (Haney et al. 1998) and in the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands from 2010-2016; no further surveys are planned (Cooper et al. 2019a). Migration routes and stopover locations have been evaluated (Cooper et al. 2017). On the wintering grounds, studies are underway to determine the utility of goat farms in creating Kirtland’s Warbler habitat; such sites appear to show promise in maintaining such habitat (Fleming et al. 2019). Breeding success and carry-over effects have been studied by Rockwell et al. (2012) whilst the potential effects of climate change have also been modelled (Brown et al. 2017, 2019; Cooper et al. 2019a). Virtually the entire population breeds within the 219,000-acre Kirtland's Warbler Management Area which includes the Michigan State Forests, the Huron National Forest, and the USFWS Kirtland's Warbler National Management Area. Conservation Actions Proposed Maintain periodically-disturbed suitable habitat on its wintering grounds in the Bahamian archipelago (Wunderle et al. 2010). Continue existing initiatives and management practices. Allow areas that are burned through naturally occurring fires to regenerate into jack pine or plant with jack pine. Maintain the area of jack pine - the planting and management of jack pine forest is considered essential to the species's long term persistence (Brown et al. 2017). Ensure rates of cowbird parasitism remain low (Brown et al. 2017).",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

However, modelling of the likely effects of mortality caused by longline fishing fleets, combined with potential losses to breeding colonies from sea-level rise and storm surges, suggests it is appropriate to precautionarily predict a moderately rapid population decline over the next three generations (66 years), hence it is classified as Near Threatened.","The species breeds on beaches and slopes with little or no vegetation, and on short turf. The species feeds mainly on flying fish eggs, squid, fish and crustaceans (Harrison et al. 1983), but also on fish offal and human refuse (Cousins 1998, Conners 2015). During both the incubation and the chick-rearing periods, birds nesting on Tern Island forage widely throughout the North Pacific, including to the distant, productive California Current waters along the west coast of North America (Fernandez et al. 2001, Kappes et al. 2010). In contrast, during the brooding period, birds from Tern Island forage predominantly within 500 to 800 km of the island (Hyrenbach et al. 2002, Conners et al. 2015, Gutowsky et al. 2015, Kappes et al. 2015).","Incidental capture in commercial fisheries represents a threat to the majority of the population. Between 1978 and 1992, the population experienced elevated mortality from interactions with high seas drift-nets in the North Pacific (Johnson et al. 1993). The estimated bycatch rates of Black-footed Albatrosses has fluctuated over the past 50 years, generally ranging between 6,000 and10,000 birds per annum (Naughton et al. 2007); in 2003, mortality was estimated to be at least 2,000 birds per year in the U.S. pelagic longline fleet based in Hawaii, and a further 6,000 in Japanese and Taiwanese fleets (Lewison and Crowder 2003). Recent observer data from the Hawaii longline fisheries, from 2010 to 2015 indicate that deep-set longlines captured an estimated 66 to 535 individuals each year and shallow-set longlines captured an observed 19-49 individuals per year. It has been recently estimated that on average 227 individuals are taken annually in the Alaskan federal groundfish and Pacific Halibut Hippoglossus stenolepis fisheries (in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, and the Gulf of Alaska Fishery Management Plan areas), which also target Pacific Cod Gadus microcephalus and Sablefish Anoplopoma fimbria. Along the west coast of the U.S.A., Black-footed Albatrosses interacting with fleets harvesting Sablefish and Pacific Hake Merluccius productus are exposed to an elevated mortality risk (Guy et al. 2013). In 2012, it was estimated that between 2006 and 2009, from 25 to 128 albatrosses (assumed to all be Black-footed Albatross) were taken annually in Canada’s Pacific demersal longline groundfish fisheries, with a predicted yearly average mortality of 85 birds (DFO 2012). Bycatch rates in the Japanese and Taiwanese longline fleets are largely unknown. However, studies on this species have confirmed the impact of fisheries bycatch on survival (Verán et al. 2007) and the annual population growth rate (Niel and Lebreton 2005). Tracking studies show that post-breeding birds disperse over large distances to the oceanographic 'transition zone' where they are susceptible to bycatch in the various pelagic longline fleets (Hyrenbach and Dotson 2003, BirdLife International 2004, Hyrenbach et al. 2006, Zydelis et al. 2011, Gutowsky et al. 2014, 2015). Within this area, tracking revealed that fishing effort was heavy in the habitats utilised by the species, and that there may be a male bias in the individuals affected by bycatch. Around the turn of the 20th century, the species suffered sharp declines due to feather hunting (Spennemann 1998). Protective measures and the cessation of feather hunting allowed the population to recover (ACAP 2010). Climate change poses an ongoing threat in terms of storms and flooding, and a future threat in terms of habitat alteration. The vast majority of the world population nests on islands below 10 m, above sea-level and it is predicted that with climate change and the resulting rise in sea-level, there will be significant inundation and loss of low-lying atolls/islands that are currently used for nesting (Storlazzi et al. 2013, Reynolds et al. 2015). Other potential threats include volcanic eruptions (Harrison 1990), pollution from agricultural effluents and solid waste including organochlorine (Jones et al. 1996, Auman et al. 1997, Guruge et al. 2001), mercury, PCB and DDE (Ludwig et al. 1998, Guruge et al. 2001, Finkelstein et al. 2006, 2007) and oil spills (Fefer et al. 1984, NOAA 1992).","Between 1995 and 2017, the average number of breeding pairs per season was c.69,900, which equates to 139,800 mature individuals (ACAP 2017).",Increasing,"Phoebastria nigripes breeds on the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.), the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands and four outlying islands off Japan. In the past, individual pairs have also bred in Mexico on Guadalupe and San Benedicto islands; however the species has not bred on either island for at least 20 years (ACAP 2010). Colonies have been lost from other Pacific islands (Whittow 1993, Cousins 1998). In total there are estimated to be 70,069 pairs breeding each year (Flint 2007, Naughton et al. 2007, ACAP 2017) in at least 16 locations. The largest population counts have been 28,610 pairs at Midway Atoll for hatch year 2015 and 24, 565 pairs at Laysan Island for hatch year 2012. Together these two sites represent approximately 72% of the global population as estimated by the highest count for each of 16 sites (12 sites surveyed within the last 10 years) (Flint 2007, Naughton et al. 2007, ACAP 2017). On Torishima, 914 chicks were reared from 1,219 pairs in 1998, compared with just 20 in 1964 (Cousins and Cooper 2000). In 2013, 2,060 pairs nested on Torishima (ACAP 2017). The species disperses widely over the northern Pacific Ocean, particularly to the north-east, towards the coastal waters of North America. There have been occasional records in the southern hemisphere (Carboneras 1992, Fernandez et al. 2001, Hyrenbach and Dotson 2001, BirdLife International 2004, Hyrenbach et al. 2006).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions Underway All Hawaiian breeding localities are part of the U.S.A. National Wildlife Refuge, the U.S.A. Marine National Monument system or State of Hawaii Seabird Sanctuaries. In 1991, a 50 Nautical Mile (92.6 km) Protected Species Zone was established around the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where longline fishing is prohibited. In 2006, the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument was established. Originally, Papahānaumokuākea protected an area of 362,073 km2; in August 2016, the National Marine Monument was expanded to 1,508,870 km2 and increasing the area in which the birds are protected from exposure to fisheries interactions (http://www.papahanaumokuakea.gov/news/expansion_announcement.html).Nearly 80% of the breeding population is counted directly or sampled every year. All sites except one have been surveyed since 1991 (Croxall and Gales 1998). Hawaiian longline fishing vessels are required to use a range of measures to reduce seabird bycatch. In 2001 and 2007, respectively, the USA and Canada released National Plans of Action to reduce the bycatch of seabirds in longline fisheries (NMFS 2001, DFO 2007). In 2002, the use of bird-scaring (or Tori) lines became a mandatory condition of licence in commercial halibut, sablefish and rockfish (Sebastes spp.) longline fisheries on Canada’s Pacific waters (DFO 2007). In 2006, the Committee on the Conservation of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) assessed Phoebastria nigripes as Special Concern (a species at risk of becoming threatened or endangered) in Canada (COSEWIC 2006); and in 2009, the species was added to Schedule 1 of Canada’s Species at Risk Act, also as Special Concern (https://www.registrelep-sararegistry.gc.ca/species/speciesDetails_e.cfm?sid=991).In 2017, the first cohort of 15 Black-footed Albatross chicks from Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge  were translocated to James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge on the island of O’ahu in Hawaii as part of a plan to establish safe breeding colonies on high islands less at risk from loss due to inundation caused by climate change factors such as sea level rise and increased storm frequency and intensity.  In 2006, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission passed a measure to require large tuna and swordfish longline vessels to use at least two seabird bycatch mitigation measures when fishing north of 23o N. The Fishing Vessel Owners' Association, which represents the longlining captains in the halibut and sablefish fisheries along the west coast of the U.S.A., has instructed its members to use streamer lines when fishing in Washington, Oregon and Californian waters. Conservation Actions Proposed Continue monitoring of population trends and demographic parameters. Continue tracking studies to assess temporal and spatial overlap with longline fisheries (e.g. Zydelis et al. 2011). Adopt best-practice mitigation measures in longline fisheries within the species' range. Re-evaluate the location of the current boundary (23o N) for required use of seabird mitigation measures in the pelagic longline fisheries in the U.S.A.

However, there have been overall population increases since 1991 and the species's population is thought to currently be growing at a slow rate. The population increase is however largely the result of intensive conservation management and thus it is likely that positive trends would reverse again if conservation action were to stop. Due to its high conservation dependence and the risk of future declines following any stochastic event, the species warrants listing as Near Threatened.","It nests on sandy beaches, sandflats, barrier islands, alkaline lakes, riverine sand / gravel bars, reservoirs, sand / gravel pits and inland along rivers and wetlands (USFWS 1996b; Plissner and Haig 1997; Elliot-Smith and Haig 2020). Ephemeral pools, bay tidal flats and areas of open vegetation are all important brood-rearing habitats (Elias et al. 2000). There is high winter site fidelity (USFWS 1996b; J. H. Plissner in litt. 1999) in sandy bays, lagoons, and algal flats / mudflats (Brush 1995; Plissner and Haig 1997), particularly around sheltered inlets (Cohen et al. 2008). The species has recently been witnessed foraging among the roots of red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), and on rocky shores on Andros Island, as well as the Bahamas during the winter (Johnson et al. 2018). The small Great Lakes population is also thought to exhibit a small male-biased adult sex ratio due to differential survival in the pre-fledging period (Saunders and Cuthbert 2015). It feeds primarily on small arthropods, particularly beetles such as Bledius opaculus (Majka and Shaffer 2008).","Drought, inappropriate water and beach management, gas / oil industry dredging operations, development, shoreline stabilisation and beach recreation and disturbance (including cat and dog predation, and possibly that from native avian species and ghost crabs [Kwon et al. 2018]) are key threats (Hecht 1995; J. H. Plissner in litt. 1999; Elias et al. 2000; Boettcher et al. 2007; Jorgensen and Bomberger Brown 2014; DeRose-Wilson et al. 2018; Gibson et al. 2018). Leg related injuries, reducing fitness, have been recorded in birds fitted with anodised aluminium rings (Amirault et al. 2006). Coastal flooding driven by climate change has been noted to cause reduced reproductive success in Virginia, and its importance is likely to increase (Boettcher et al. 2007). The effects of sea level rise and enhanced coastal flooding, particularly from extreme events such as hurricanes (Saunders et al. 2014), are likely to reduce available Piping Plover habitat as habitat migration is widely constrained by human development alongside wetland environments (Seavey et al. 2011). Furthermore, a proliferation of proposals for single-turbine wind projects on beaches along the USA's Atlantic coast, where plovers nest, presents a further, increasing threat to the species (Stantial and Cohen 2018). Expanding Merlin populations, a primary predator of the Piping Plover, in the Great Lakes region are also thought to be a significant threat to the species's population viability and by incorporating an index of Merlin abundance, the quasi-extinction probability (less than or equal to 15 breeding pairs remaining) is now estimated as ~12% over a 10-year period (Saunders et al. 2014, 2018).","The latest census data recorded 4,016 (2019) mature individuals on the Atlantic coast, ~3,500 on the northern Great Plains and Prairies (2016), and 147 in the Great Lakes (2014-18) (USFWS 2020; USFWS unpubl. data; B. Andres in litt. 2020); totaling 7,663 breeding individuals. The Great Plains/prairies population is however liable to fluctuations and remains under-surveyed, hence its true total may be greater. Partners in Flight (2019) therefore estimate the total population to number 8,400 mature individuals and as a result, the population is placed here between 7,600-8,400 mature individuals, equivalent to a population of c.11,500-12,500 individuals in total.",Increasing,"Charadrius melodus breeds in the U.S.A. and Canada. Regular range-wide breeding censuses are carried out, with the latest census data (2016-2019) suggesting a population of 7,663 mature individuals (USFWS 2020; USFWS unpubl. data; B. Andres in litt. 2020). Populations occur along the Atlantic coast (subspecies melodus), with 4,016 breeding individuals counted in 2019 (USFWS 2004, 2020; Elliott-Smith et al. 2009); in the Great Plains (subspecies circumcinctus), numbering ~3,500 breeders in 2016 (Ferland and Haig 2001; Elliott-Smith et al. 2009; B. Andres in litt. 2020), and in the Great Lakes region (also circumcinctus), with an average of 147 breeding birds counted between 2014-2018 (Stucker 2004; Elliott-Smith et al. 2009; Miller et al. 2010; USFWS unpubl. data). Totals in 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2016-2019 respectively were 1,892, 2,581, 2,920, 3,320 and 4,016 (in 2019) breeding birds on the Atlantic coast, 32, 48, 72, 110 and 147 (in 2018) in the Great Lakes and 2,744, 3,284, 2,953, 4,662 and ~3,500 (in 2016) in the Prairie Canada / U.S. northern Great Plains population (Elliot-Smith et al. 2009; USFWS 2020; USFWS unpubl. data; B. Andres in litt. 2020). The recent, apparent decline in the prairies/Great Plains largely reflects the population's fluctuating nature in response to wet-dry cycles and a lack of surveyed sites leaving individuals unrecorded; numbers in this population are similar to the average of the past five surveys (3,320 plovers, 1991–2011), hence it is considered stable. Overall populations increased by ~70% between 1991 and 2011 and despite local fluctuations and a recent slowdown in the rate of increase, populations are considered to be stable or in a slow increase. However, it must be noted that these increases are the result of sustained management initiatives, upon which populations remain heavily dependent. Small numbers also nest on St Pierre and Miquelon (to France) (P. Wood in litt. 1999). Less than 60% of birds are recorded in winter (Brush 1995; USFWS 1996b; Plissner and Haig 1997; J. H.

There were censuses in 1991, 1996, 2001 and 2006 (Plissner and Haig 1997; J. H. Plissner in litt. 1999) and censuses have continued since. It is considered Endangered in U.S.A. and Canada. There is a recovery plan for Atlantic coast breeders (USFWS 1996b; A. Hecht in litt. 1999). The Novia Scotia Piping Plover Conservation Program uses monitoring and site protection to aid species recovery in Nova Scotia, Canada (Abbott 2008). Predator management has increased hatching success (D. Amirault in litt. 1999; A. Hecht in litt. 1999). Seasonal restrictions and public education have limited disturbance (Hecht 1995; A. Hecht in litt. 1999). Measures to protect breeding and wintering beaches are having mixed results; $3 million per year is being spent in Atlantic U.S.A. alone on numerous management measures (nest exclosures, beach stewards etc. [B. Andres in litt. 2020]), and this will need to be kept up indefinitely. Nature Canada filed a lawsuit in 2006 against the Canadian Environment Ministry for failing to take necessary measures under the Species at Risk Act, which resulted in a revised recovery plan with critical habitat identified. The Great Lakes population is supplemented by captively bred individuals (Roche et al. 2008), and also utilises nest exclosures and beach stewards (S. Saunders in litt. 2020). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed 255 ha of sandbar habitat on the Missouri River, USA, between 2004 to 2009 however, whilst exhibiting some success, it was shown to exhibit considerably lower nest success, pre-fledging chick survival and hatch-year survival than sandbar habitat created through natural flood processes (Hunt et al. 2018). Effective habitat creation should however, be viewed as an essential action in increasing Piping Plover populations as Robinson et al. (2019) observed that populations appear to be at carrying-capacity and are habitat limited, yet expanded significantly following increases in natural habitat availability. The Platte River Recovery Implementation Program (PRRIP) and its partners have invested considerable resources in generating and managing off-channel nesting habitat for Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) along the central Platte River in Nebraska; measures implemented to increase nest and brood survival at nesting sites include: tree removal, water barrier construction around nesting areas, predator fence installation, and predator trapping (Farrell et al. 2018). Both nest success and brood success were recorded at 75% in this area, thus it is concluded that such habitat management techniques are sufficient in maintaining high levels of productivity in Piping Plover populations along the central Platte River (Farrell et al. 2018). Furthermore, following the discovery of a large wintering population of Piping Plovers in Joulter Cays, Bahamas, the Bahamian government included the area when designating an additional 113,920 acres of protected land in September 2015 (Saha 2015). Conservation Actions ProposedDetermine the importance of north-west Mexico for wintering birds. Continue breeding and wintering censuses (A. Hecht in litt. 1999). Develop action plans for Great Lakes and wintering birds (A. Hecht in litt. 1999; J. H. Plissner in litt. 1999). Protect breeding and wintering beaches, and expand existing measures (D. Amirault in litt. 1999; A. Hecht in litt. 1999; J. H. Plissner in litt. 1999). Create sand-flats near to roosting sites on its wintering grounds, to mitigate against habitat loss (Cohen et al. 2008). Assess the relative effects of different predators on plover populations, and the effectiveness of predator and disturbance management measures (Boettcher et al. 2007).

The population is declining at a rate exceeding 60% in ten years and is highly susceptible to avian malaria, with climate change projected to cause an increase in the elevation below which regular transmission occurs.","It inhabits `ohi`a and native mixed forest mainly above 600 m, to highest point of island at 1,600 m with densest populations above 1,100 m (Lepson 2020). but has been previously found as low as 100 m (especially in the north-west of the island) (USFWS 1983, Pratt et al. 1987, Lepson 1997). It is able to tolerate considerable habitat disturbance, but at lower population densities (Lepson 1997). It feeds on nectar and arthropods (especially caterpillars and spiders) and nests in `ohi`a trees (Lepson 1997). Nest construction begins as early as February, and may continue into late July (Eddinger 1970), with mean nest height being estimated at 6.1 m in the late 1960s (Eddinger 1970) and 7.7 ± 2.2 m SD in a study conducted in 2012-2013 (Hammond et al. 2016). The species is only known to nest in `ohi`a trees (Eddinger 1970, Lepson 1997, Hammond et al. 2016). Males help females with nest construction to a lesser extent. Females are the sole incubators, but males feed females during incubation, typically away from the nest. Both males and females provision nestlings and fledglings (Eddinger 1970).","From the late 1890s, significant declines have been associated with habitat loss and degradation (either owing to clearance for timber and agriculture, or to introduced herbivores), and the spread of avian diseases (Lepson 1997). Ongoing development in the Kôke`e area continues to diminish the amount of habitat available, and the spread of exotic plants into native habitats, although tolerated, is associated with lower densities (Lepson 2020). The species is particularly vulnerable to avian malaria (Whitaker 2022). Introduced mosquitoes, which spread avian pox and malaria, are now common at 900 m, and may be breeding as high as 1,200 m elevation (Lepson 1997, Glad and Crampton 2015). Climate change is projected to cause an increase in the elevation below which transmission of avian malaria occurs (Liao et al. 2017). Under a 2oC warming scenario and an increase in rainfall over high-elevation forests during the next 100 years, in keeping with climate model predictions for the region, the prevalence of malaria on Kaua`i is predicted to increase within the remaining habitat (Benning et al. 2002). The 17 oC isotherm, below which Plasmodium prevalence peaks, is predicted to shift upwards by around 300 m, decreasing the area of forest where Plasmodium prevalence is limited by 85% (Benning et al. 2002). Such changes are already associated with increased prevalence of avian malaria in this species (Atkinson et al. 2014) and the species' range is contracting (Paxton et al. 2016). Feral pigs facilitate the spread of both alien plants and mosquitoes and, with other ungulates, continue to degrade native forests (Pratt 1994, VanderWerf 2012). Predation by introduced animals (rats and possibly cats and Barn Owls Tyto alba) is an additional pressure (Lepson 1997, Hammond et al. 2016), while other introduced taxa (especially the Mountain White-eye Zosterops japonicus, wasps and ants) may compete for arthropod resources (Lepson 1997). Invasive plants have degraded significant portions of Kôke`e State Park and threaten the remainder of the habitat (P. Roberts in litt. 2007, Behnke et al. 2016). In addition to exacerbating the threat of introduced diseases, climate change is predicted to increase the geographic extent and intensity of habitat loss, invasive plants and non-native predators (Paxton et al. 2018). This species' restriction to Kaua`i and dependence on canopy species makes it vulnerable to catastrophic events such as hurricanes (P. Roberts in litt. 2007) which have caused substantial declines in the past (Pratt 1993, 1994). The emergence of the Ceratocystis wilt pathogen that causes rapid ‘ohi‘a death may also be a potential threat (Camp et al. 2019).","Estimates based on surveys of both the interior and exterior areas of the Alaka'i Plateau in 2012 placed the population at 10,787 individuals (95% CI: 8,396 – 13,434) (Paxton et al. 2016). Surveys in 2018 placed the population at 8,703 individuals (95% CI: 6,467–11,221) (Paxton et al. 2020), roughly equivalent to 4,300-7,500 mature individuals overall. Assuming declines have continued at the same rate (The most recent population estimate suggests a decline of c.64% within the time period 2008-2018 [Paxton et al. 2020]), this would now place the population in the band 3,000-5,000 mature individuals. There is possibly a small, isolated population in the Makaleha Mountains (Camp et al. 2009), however this is precautionarily assumed not to host mature individuals given the lack of recent records.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Kaua`i in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), where it occurred almost throughout the island in the 19th century but, by 1900, had become uncommon to rare in lowland forests (Lepson 1997). ","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayMuch of current range protected to some extent by Kōke'e State Park and Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve (Lepson 2020). Removal of ungulates and invasive plants is ongoing (USFWS 2017). Portions of the Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve and the Hono O Na Pali reserve have been fenced (VanderWerf 2012). Weed control has been conducted by The Nature Conservancy and Kōke‘e Resource Conservation Program (VanderWerf 2012). Since 2014, expanding grids of Goodnature A24 rat traps have protected nests and breeding birds in the Alaka’i Wilderness Preserve (L. C. Crampton in litt. 2016). Development of genetic tools to reduce transmission of avian malaria is ongoing. This includes transgenic or genetically modified mosquitoes that have reduced ability to transmit pathogens and also incompatible insect techniques, for example using a different strain of Wolbachia bacteria to produce males that cannot produce viable offspring (USFWS 2017, Miranda Paez et al. 2022).Conservation Actions ProposedContinue genetic research in disease immunity in Hawaiian honeycreepers (Paxton et al. 2018). Continue research in the fields of genomic technologies and genetically modified mosquitoes for disease control and their field application (USFWS 2017). Continue conducting periodic range-wide surveys to monitor status (VanderWerf 2012). Protect core forest habitats (Paxton et al. 2018).

Its population size and extent of habitat are declining, probably as a result of the encroachment of avian malaria into higher elevations as temperatures increase due to climate change. For these reasons, it is listed as Critically Endangered.","It occurs in mesic 'ohi'a-koa and wet 'ōhi'a forest from 1,100-2,300 m (99% above 1,500 m, mostly below 2,100 m). It primarily feeds on 'ōhi'a nectar, also taking invertebrates, especially caterpillars. When 'ōhi'a bloom is at its seasonal low, it feeds on subcanopy and understorey flowers and fruit (Berger 1972; Scott et al. 1986; P. Baker in litt. 1999; J. C. Simon in litt. 1999). All known nests have been in 'ōhi'a trees (Berlin and VanGelder 1999). It raises 1-2 young per nest, usually nesting twice seasonally (November to June [Simon et al. 2001]), and has a relatively high success rate (J. C. Simon in litt. 1999; Simon et al. 2001). Adult survivorship is similarly high (Simon et al. 2001). Birds, perhaps especially immatures, may disperse to lower elevations (Berlin and VanGelder 1999).","Habitat destruction and modification and the rapid spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes in the lowlands are thought to be responsible for past declines. There has been extensive historic loss of forest within the species's range, through logging and clearance for agriculture.The most significant long-term threat is Avian Malaria (Judge et al. 2019). The disease is transmitted by the introduced southern house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, and has been detected in the Akohekohe (Feldman et al. 1995). Both the Culex quinquefasciatus mosquito and the Plasmodium relictum parasite develop more easily at higher temperatures (LaPointe et al. 2010), and the resultant prevalence of malaria at lower elevations is thought to explain the species's recent range contraction at lower elevations (Judge et al. 2019). The species may be particularly vulnerable to mosquito-borne diseases, including avian malaria and avian pox, because it migrates altitudinally in response to varying 'ōhi'a flowering physiology, potentially increasing exposure to mosquitoes at lower elevations (USFWS 2003). Increased temperatures associated with climate change are predicted to increase the prevalence of malaria at higher altitudes in the future (Freed et al. 2005). An analysis of the impact of a two degree Celsius temperature rise (as predicted by the end of this century) on the area of malaria-free forest in the Hanawi Forest found that the area where malarial infection is highly probable would increase from 40% to 63% (Benning et al. 2002). A model of the impact of malaria encroachment under climate change on the species's range predicted that the species will lose 92.1% of its range between 1990–2010 and 2080–2100 (Fortini et al. 2015).From 1945 to 1995, the spread of feral pigs on Haleakala caused chronic habitat degradation (Loope and Medeiros 1995) and facilitated the spread of mosquitoes into remote rainforests (Pratt 1994). In Hanawi Natural Area Reserve, there was a 473% increase in pig activity, as indexed by ground-cover disturbance, during 1970-1997 (Rosa et al. 1998), and this reduced alternative food sources to 'ōhi'a bloom (Berlin and VanGelder 1999). Predation by introduced rats, cats, Barn Owl (Tyto alba) and possibly small Indian Mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus) is a further limiting factor (Berlin and VanGelder 1999, J. M. Scott in litt. 1999, J. C. Simon in litt. 1999, E. VanGelder in litt. 1999). Recently introduced pathogens, Ceratocystis lukuohia and C. huliohia, both of which cause rapid 'ōhi'a death (R.O.D.), or 'ohi'a Wilt, have spread rapidly across the Hawaiian islands and caused extensive mortality of 'ōhi'a (Keith et al. 2015), which is an important food and nesting plant for Akohekohe. The effects of R.O.D. were noticed on Hawai'i by 2012, the disease was first identified in 2014 (Keith et al. 2015) and the Ceratocystis species involved were confirmed in 2018 (Barnes et al.). Ceratocystis sp. have now spread rapidly across much of the lowland forests on Hawai'i island, as well as on Kaua'i and O'ahu, with more than 600 km2 of forest affected by 2019 (Mortenson et al. 2016; Fortini et al. 2019; College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources 2020). Surveys of infected forest have found that an average of 25% of 'ōhi'a trees were dead (Camp et al. 2019). Surveys in an infected area of forest found that the density of another Hawaiian honeycreeper, the Hawaii Amakihi (Chlorodrepanis virens), declined by 79% between 2003-2004 and 2016, following the infection of the forest with R.O.D. (Camp et al. 2019). In 2019, a single 'ōhi'a tree was confirmed to be infected on Maui and was destroyed (College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources 2020). C. lukuohia appears to be associated with higher temperatures, and a model of its potential range across Hawaii under current climatic conditions suggested that it may not affect habitat at higher elevations on Maui where the Akohekohe occurs (Fortini et al. 2019), but climate change could facilitate its spread into higher elevations where it may impact the Akohekohe.Climate change may also cause habitat shifts and increase the frequency of extreme weather events that could present further threats to the Akohekohe.","Surveys in 2017 resulted in a population estimate of 1,768 (95% C.I. 1,193–2,411) individuals (Judge et al. 2019). This estimate is assumed to represent mature individuals. The population size is therefore here placed in the range of 1,100-2,500 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Palmeria dolei occurs on Maui in the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.) and is extinct on Moloka'i (last confirmed observations in 1907).

Studies have been carried out with the more common I'iwi (Drepanis coccinea) to investigate the feasibility of translocating the species (Becker et al. 2010). Research has been carried out using radio-tracking to determine juvenile and adult habitat selection, dispersal and seasonal movements (Maui Forest Bird Recovery Project 2013).Cooperative management of the East Maui watershed includes fencing at c.1,070 m and removal of feral ungulates (Loope and Medeiros 1995, P. Baker in litt. 1999). In the Waikamoi Preserve, Hanawi Natural Area Reserve and Haleakala National Park, conservation practices combat the establishment of alien plants and, from the late 1980s, feral pigs have been controlled (Loope and Medeiros 1995, Simon et al. 1997).

It may also survive in south-eastern Cuba, but there have been no confirmed records since 1987 despite many searches. If extant, the global population is likely to be tiny, and for these reasons it is treated as Critically Endangered.","It was originally found in bottomland hardwood in the U.S.A. and in Cuba, where it also resided in montane (pine, mixed and broadleaf) forests. Historic accounts indicate that it has a very large home range and occurs naturally at low densities, suggesting that large contiguous tracts of mature woodland would be required to support a viable population (Jackson 2002). The Big Woods area comprises several distinct types of swamp and bottomland hardwood forests (Fitzpatrick et al. 2005), covering a total area of c.220,000 ha. In Cuba, extensive habitat loss and degradation in the lowlands mean that any remaining population may be restricted to intact montane Pinus cubensis forests. The primary requirement is for dead trees, which harbour wood-boring beetle larvae, its preferred food source. It forages by stripping bark from dead trees, using its bill like a carpenter's chisel, and also takes fruit, nuts and seeds (Jackson 2002). The breeding season is between March and June in Cuba, and between February and May in the U.S.A.","Logging and clearance for agriculture have been suggested as a primary cause of the species's past decline however, the regions where the species is purported to remain in the U.S.A. are currently undergoing a net increase in habitat as a result of re-forestry and the ongoing maturation of previously cut forests (Collins 2019, G. Hill in litt. 2020). Hunting has also been implicated in the rapid population decline, and it has been proposed that this was the primary cause of its decline, with habitat destruction playing a secondary role, but this theory is contentious (Snyder 2007, Hill 2008, M. Lammertink in litt. 2012).","Given the lack of confirmed sightings since 1944 any remaining population within the USA is likely to be tiny. A tiny population may also remain in Cuba, despite lack of recent sightings. Its total population, if extant, is likely to number fewer than 50 individuals and mature individuals.",Unknown,"Campephilus principalis formerly occurred at low densities throughout the south-east U.S.A. (nominate principalis) and Cuba (subspecies bairdii). Sixty years after the last confirmed North American record in north-eastern Louisiana in 1944, the species was reported to have been rediscovered in 2004 in the Big Woods region of eastern Arkansas (Fitzpatrick et al. 2005). Evidence for the rediscovery comes in the form of seven sightings, a short poor-quality video, over 100 sound recordings indicative of this species from automatic recording stations, and a number of additional ""possible encounters"" (Charif et al. 2005, Dalton 2005, Fitzpatrick et al. 2005, M. Lammertink in litt. 2005, 2006). The sound and video recordings have been analysed in detail, and the identity of the recorded birds has been debated between Ivory-billed Woodpecker and other sources, including the Pileated Woodpecker Dryocopus pileatus (Fitzpatrick et al. 2005, Sibley et al. 2006, Fitzpatrick et al. 2006, Sibley et al. 2007, Collinson 2007, Fitzpatrick et al. 2007). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that the recordings provided compelling evidence for the presence of Ivory-billed Woodpecker in 2004, and that search efforts were warranted (USFWS 2010). However, intensive searches until 2009 did not find conclusive evidence for the continued presence of the species in the Big Woods region. There were also unconfirmed reports by researchers working in forests along the Choctawhatchee River in Florida, reporting 14 sightings and 309 double knock and kent calls during 2005-2006. Additional sightings and calls were compiled in the 2006-2007 field season, but no incontrovertible evidence was obtained (Hill et al. 2006). Similarly, video and sound recordings made during 2006 and 2008 in Louisiana suggest characteristics of the species (Collins 2011, 2017). A search in the coastal mangrove forests and inland hammock forests of south Florida in 2009 failed to find any sign of the species (Gold 2009), but south Florida has large areas of potential habitat and there is a relatively high frequency of plausible reports from there in recent decades (M. Lammertink in litt. 2012). Between the last confirmed sightings in 1944 and the 2000s records discussed above, there were more than 20 reports from within its historic range (Jackson 2002, Roberts et al. 2010) and Michaels (2015) suggests there have been many more unconfirmed sightings, including records from several years after the last official sighting in 1944.The species may survive in Cuba, although searches have not found any new records subsequent to those of the late 1980s (M. Lammertink in litt. 2004). The best hope lies in the Alejandro de Humboldt National Park, an area in which despite regular bird inventories being taken some sections have been only sparsely searched (M. Lammertink in litt. 2012). Calls potentially of this species were heard in 1998 in the Sierra Maestra in south-east Cuba (D. S. Lee verbally 1998, G. M. Kirwan in litt. 1999), in an area from which there had been no historical records and at an elevation higher than the known altitudinal range of the species. Follow-up searches in the area found poor habitat and no indications of presence of the species (M. Lammertink in litt. 2004). With the lack of recent confirmed records and no evidence of large woodpecker activity (M. Lammertink in litt. 2012), this subspecies also may well be extinct. A recent statistical analysis of physical evidence and independent expert opinion, as part of a study into the burden of proof required for controversial sightings of possibly extinct species, supported the view that this species is very likely extinct (Roberts et al. 2010). Similarly, use of statistical methods for estimating the probability of species persistence from collection dates of museum specimens, along with quantitative stopping rules for terminating the search for missing or allegedly extinct species (based on survey data for counts of co-occurring species that are encountered in the search for a target species) suggest there is virtually no chance that the species remains extant within its historical range in the southeastern United States (Gotelli et al. 2012). In addition, a Bayesian method accounting for sightings of uncertain validity was applied to certain and uncertain sightings over the period 1897-2010, and results indicated substantial support for extinction (Solow et al. 2012). Nevertheless, other statistical studies have shown that, when considering the specific natural history traits of large woodpeckers, small numbers of Ivory-billed Woodpecker may have persisted up to the present (Mattsson et al. 2008), and that very large search efforts are needed to detect small populations (Scott et al. 2008). Collins (2019) suggests that video evidence obtained in recent years displays behavioral and morphological traits consistent only with those of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker and that the species likely remains extant, although clear, definitive photographic evidence of the species remains elusive. Any remnant population in either the U.S.A. or Cuba is likely to be tiny.","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayAfter the reported rediscovery in February 2004, intensive surveys involving dozens of observers, automatic cameras and recording equipment have been carried out in the Big Woods area (Fitzpatrick et al. 2005). Searches have also continued in other parts of the south-east U.S.A. that have historic records of the species, with specific searches taking place in 28 locations across that area in 2004-2009 (Hill et al. 2006, Rohrbaugh et al. 2007, M. Lammertink in litt. 2012). An endangered species recovery team of c. 50 members has been appointed (Jackson 2006). Between October 2003 and September 2013 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) spent $20.3 million on efforts to document and protect the species, including through habitat protection and acquisition ($13.2 million spent on land acquisitions) (Jackson 2015). In October 2009, the search for the species in the U.S.A. was suspended because the most promising areas, including most of Arkansas's Big Woods, had already been surveyed to some extent (Dalton 2010, M. Lammertink in litt. 2012). USFWS published a recovery plan in April 2010 (Dalton 2010, USFWS 2010). Part of the Big Woods area falls within the Cache River and White River national wildlife refuges. In Cuba there have been a number of searches for the species, and further searches were planned for 2010 and 2011 (BirdLife International unpubl. data).Conservation Actions ProposedEvaluate new reports of the species and follow up with searches in cases of credible reports in the U.S.A. and Cuba (M. Lammertink in litt. 2012), to document the species's continued existence and determine its population size and distribution. Ensure strict protection of any nests and nesting trees, if found.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","The species breeds in swamps, bogs and fens ranging from western Alaska eastward to Newfoundland (Tuck 1972, Arnold 1994). The population along the U.S. Pacific coast is resident, while populations elsewhere migrate to non-breeding grounds in southern U.S.A. and northern South America. Individuals begin departing the breeding grounds in late summer, with males preceding females by up to one month (Whitehead 1965, Tuck 1972). Spring migration peaks during late March, but may begin as early as late February or early March (Tuck 1972). The species forages in soft mud by probing for invertebrates and plant material (Tuck 1972). The species requires habitats composed of moist soils with an interspersion of soil and shallow water (Rundle 1981). It prefers habitats with short vegetation, including agricultural fields and pastures, but is less common on open mudflats or continuous areas of open water (Tuck 1972, Rundle 1981, Long &amp; Ralph 2001). Lack of rainfall can decrease the habitat quality for the species (Arnold 1994). On the non-breeding grounds, factors like changing water levels across a region (e.g. coastal habitats, inland habitats), temperature, agricultural practices and other anthropogenic factors contribute to changing numbers at various locations (Robbins 1952, Carroll 2011).","The most severe threat to the species is the continuing loss and degradation of wetlands throughout the range (American Bird Conservancy 2018).

Observed declines in Peruvian colonies and an overall reduction in the number of breeding colonies indicate that there is probably an ongoing, underlying rapid decline in numbers. The species consequently qualifies as Vulnerable. However, if the Chilean population, which comprises the majority of the global population, is found to be stable, the species will warrant downlisting in the future.","Breeding sites It nests on islands and rocky coastal stretches, using a variety of nest types including guano and dirt burrows, surface nests, vegetation- and rock-covered scrapes, rock crevices, sea caves and under rocks at breakwater walls (Battistini and Paredes 1999, Simeone and Bernal 2000, Paredes and Zavalaga 2001). It apparently prefers to breed on slopes at high elevation sites where guano deposits are available for burrow excavation (Paredes and Zavalaga 2001). Reproductive behaviour Breeding occurs year-round, but has two peaks, in autumn-winter (April through July) and in spring (August through December), with latitudinal shifts in dates between Peru and Chile (Paredes et al. 2002, Simeone et al. 2002, de la Puente et al. 2013). Moult Birds moult mainly during January and February, but moult in juveniles is less synchronous (Simeone et al. 2002, Paredes et al. 2003, de la Puente et al. 2013). Migratory range It is uncertain whether this is a migratory species, but a part of the population migrates after moult (March), with birds from Pan de Azúcar migrating over 600 km (Culik and Luna-Jorquera 1997b) and birds from Puñihuil over 1,000 km (Pütz et al. 2016) northwards from their colonies. Diet Depending on locality, it feeds on a variety of fish species including Peruvian Anchovy (Engraulis ringens), Araucanian Herring (Strangomera bentincki), Silverside (Odontesthes regia), Common Hake (Merluccius gayi), Inca Scad (Trachurus murphyi), Garfish (Scomberesox saurus scombroides) and South American Pilchard (Sardinops sagax). Diet also includes squid: Dosidiscus gigas and Loligo gahi (Herling et al. 2005).  Foraging behaviour Humboldt Penguins are highly dependent on predictable food resources in coastal waters near the nesting sites (Taylor et al. 2002). During the chick-rearing period, adults forage within 20-35 km around the colony, while incubating birds may reach up to 72 km from the colony (Culik and Luna-Jorquera 1997a, Culik et al. 1998, Chiu et al. 2011). The species typically makes short, shallow dives within 30 m of the surface (Taylor et al. 2002). At Isla Pan de Azúcar, Chile, it was found that maximum dive depth was 53 m. Population health Health surveys conducted on breeding adults from Punta San Juan showed that birds are in good condition. Haematology, plasma chemistries, and plasma mineral levels varied between years. Positive antibody titers for Chlamydophila psittaci (62%), avian adenovirus (7%), paramyxovirus-2 (7%) and Salmonella pullorum (7%) were found (Smith et al. 2008). Sallaberry-Pincheira et al. (2015) detected Haemoproteus sp. in wild ranging Humboldt Penguins at Punta San Juan, but it is unclear whether Haemoproteus sp. sporozoites are able to infect and develop in penguin cells (see Levin et al. 2013, Valkiunas et al. 2014) and, until this has been conclusively demonstrated, it seems unlikely that these parasites pose a significant threat for their conservation (Vanstreels et al. 2016). Pollution Humboldt Penguins at Punta San Juan were evaluated for 55 important trace elements, including Hg [maximum Hg concentrations in serum (0.0056 ± 0.001 µg/g), whole blood (0.297 ± 0.0683 µg/g), and feathers (1.8 μg/g dw)], but at levels generally not considered to cause health impairment. Plasma samples from the same animals were analysed for 31 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and 11 organochlorine (OC) residues using gas chromatography coupled to an ion trap mass spectrometer and for 15 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) using gas chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. The detection rate for PCBs was 69%, with congeners 105, 118, 180, and 153 most commonly detected (Adkesson unpubl. data).   ","The Humboldt Current System has alternating blooms and depletions of productivity triggered by El Niño-La Niña dynamics. During El Niño, prey availability is reduced to penguins (Culik et al. 2000, Taylor et al. 2002), inducing nest abandonment and chick mortality (Paredes and Zavalaga 1998, Simeone et al. 2002). However, La Niña conditions improve food availability, producing higher breeding success and chick survival (Simeone et al. 2002). Increased frequency and intensity of El Niño events will likely harm the Humboldt Penguin by reducing its ability to recover fast enough, as has been observed in the Galápagos Penguin Spheniscus mendiculus (Boersma 1998, Vargas et al. 2006). Flooding has been recorded to cause species mortality and a loss of reproductive success in some areas of this species’s range.The high number of artisanal gillnet fisheries operating within the species range is a considerable concern for the species, and may be of greater impact than large-scale fisheries (Crawford et al. 2017). Industrial fisheries in Peru and Chile exploit the main prey species of penguins (sardines and anchovies). A study by Jahncke et al. (2004) demonstrated that the removal of forage fish is an important pressing threat to several seabirds in the Humboldt Current Ecosystem, that may be hindering their ability to recover to pre-industrial fisheries population levels. Gillnets from artisanal fisheries regularly entangle and kill penguins both in Chile (Simeone et al. 1999, Wallace et al. 1999, Skewgar et al. 2009) and Peru (Majluf et al. 2002, J. Alfaro-Shigueto pers. comm.), and penguins have been shown to be caught as bycatch in large-scale trawl, porse-seine and long-line fisheries throughout their range (Crawford et al. 2017). Simeone et al. (1999) suggest that more penguins die in gill nets during winter, when birds are away from the colonies. In Peru, illegal use of explosives by fishermen has caused penguin mortality (J. Reyes pers. comm.); this also occurs in northern Chile, although it seems to be infrequent (CONAF 2016).Introduced rats (House Rat Rattus rattus and Brown Rat R. norvegicus) predate unattended eggs at several colonies in north and central Chile (Simeone and Luna-Jorquera 2012) and have also been recorded killing chicks in Punta San Juan, Peru (S. Cárdenas-Alayza pers. obs.). Feral dogs Canis familiaris have been reported to kill adults at Pájaro Niño Island in central Chile (Simeone and Bernal 2000) while feral cats Felis catus have been observed on some islands with breeding colonies in Peru. Native Culpeo Lycalopex culpeo have been noted to cause considerable mortality in coastal colonies in Peru, while gulls and vultures are typical egg and chick predators (M. Cardeña pers. comm.).Disturbance impacts may be locally significant for the species. Penguin colonies are frequently visited by tourists and fishermen collecting seafood or seaweeds in northern Chile (Simeone and Schlatter 1998, Ellenberg et al. 2006, CONAF 2016) and Peru. Simeone and Schlatter (1998) reported considerable trampling of nests by unregulated tourists at Puñihuil Islands and by guano harvesters in Peru (P. Majluf pers. comm.). As the species is extremely sensitive to human presence, breeding success is significantly reduced at frequently visited sites (Ellenberg et al. 2006).Historical declines resulted from over-exploitation of guano, which greatly reduced the availability and quality of nesting habitat (Coker 1920, Murphy 1936). Removal of guano reduces the preferred substrate used by penguins to dig burrows (Murphy 1936, Duffy et al. 1984, Paredes and Zavalaga 2001), but guano miners also increase adult and egg mortality through direct harvest, trampling of nests, direct disturbance to breeding sites and by the introduction of alien species such as dogs and rats (Duffy et al. 1984). The coastal and marine area around the major colonies in northern Chile (29-30°S) is currently threatened by the construction of coal-fired power stations (Cárcamo et al. 2011) and large mining proposals (E. Vilaplana in litt. 2018). An industrial mega-port has been approved in the bay close to Punta San Juan, the largest colony for Peru (P. Majluf pers. comm.). In northern Chile, eggs are collected for local consumption and birds are killed for use as fish and crab bait.There is also the potential for oil spills affecting some colonies. In central Chile, two major oil spills occurred in the period 2015-2016, threatening the colony at Cachagua, which contains 800 mature individuals. Over the longer term, the reproductive success of oiled individuals is likely to be impaired and impacts on the marine environment are likely to impact food resources in concert with climate impacts.","A census of the breeding population in Chile carried out in spring 2017, considering all known colonies, suggests that this country holds a population of 5,100 breeding pairs, equating to 10,200 mature individuals. A census of moulting birds, including mature and immature individuals, carried out in January 2017 in Peru, accounted for 13,600 individuals in this country (P. McGill pers. comm.). This roughly equates to a global population of 23,800 mature individuals, though this is considered a maximum value.",Decreasing,"Spheniscus humboldti occurs along the coastal zone from Isla Foca (5° 12´S) in Peru down to Isla Guafo (43° 32´S) in southern Chile. At least 49 breeding sites have been confirmed between Punta Aguja (5° 47´S) and Isla Metalqui (42° 12´S) in Peru and Chile, respectively (Reyes-Arriagada et al. 2009). Key colonies are situated at Punta San Juan and Isla Santa Rosa in Peru, and Pan de Azúcar, Chañaral, Choros, Tilgo and Pajaros Island in Chile. A vagrant individual was recorded in Alaska, although it likely was transported by boat (Van Buren and Boersma 2007). Historically, the population suffered a severe decline starting in the mid-1800s due to the extensive guano harvest in Peru and northern Chile, which removed the preferred nesting habitat (Murphy 1936). According to Johnson (1965), the Humboldt Penguin occurred by the “hundreds of thousands” before the guano exploitation started. In the early 1980s, just prior to the 1982-83 El Niño event, the global population was estimated at 16,000-20,000 birds (Hays 1986, Araya and Todd 1987). After this El Niño event, numbers dropped to 5,000-6,000 individuals, but it is uncertain whether this reduction actually represented mortality or dispersal or a combination of both (Hays 1986, Araya and Todd 1987).Evidence from satellite-tracked individuals suggests that part of the population migrate between 600-1,000 km northwards during the winter. This has been observed from colonies in northern Chile (Culik and Luna-Jorquera 1997a) and southern Chile (Pütz et al. 2016). Based on band recoveries, Wallace et al. (1999) showed dispersal of penguins from a colony in central Chile up to 600 km to the south and 80 km to the north. Recent geolocation sensor data for Peru indicates post moult movements from breeding individuals at Punta San Juan (15º 22'S) southward up to the Magellan Region (49º 51'S) in Chile (Paredes et al. unpubl. data).","",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayColonies in Peru and Chile are monitored regularly. In January 2010, the Peruvian government established the Guano System National Reserve (Decreto Supremo 024–2009-MINAM) (Ministerio de Ambiente 2012, http://www.minam.gob.pe/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/decreto_supremo_024-2009.pdf). This network of headlands, capes and islands harbours nesting sites of Humboldt Penguins and protects major foraging areas around them. The San Fernando National Reserve (established in July 2011 by the Decreto Supremo 017–2011-MINAM) is also a major site for penguins. Monitoring and removal of rodents has recently begun at Punta San Juan (Cárdenas-Alayza unpubl.). Recently, the Chilean Forest Service eradicated rabbits from Isla Choros in northern Chile, and they have developed an Action Plan (CONAF 2016) for the species aiming to improve its conservation in the country and particularly within the protected area network. Currently, the National Zoo in Santiago (Chile) is successfully developing an ex-situ programme by raising chicks from neglected eggs taken from wild populations. Recently, the Shimonoseki Marine Science Museum (Japan) succeeded in artificially inseminating female penguins from frozen sperm (K. Ueda pers. comm.).Conservation Actions ProposedCurrently, population estimates for Peru and Chile are determined by different methods and this prevents comparisons and estimates of the global population. Therefore, a consolidated census methodology for both Peru and Chile should be established. Determine the optimum survey times and methods for assessing the population size of the species in both countries (e.g. define whether censuses of breeding or moulting birds [or both] should be conducted for the species). Quantify the impact of identified threats on distribution, abundance, and breeding success. Identify and quantify the impacts of climate change on population size, distribution, and breeding success. Determine basic life history parameters at strategic colonies along the species's distribution, including juvenile dispersal and survival, breeding success and population size. Identify critical areas for conservation, both inland (breeding) and at sea (foraging), and monitor strategic colonies to detect changes in abundance and how colonies behave during periods of food abundance and scarcity. Determine whether the fluctuations in numbers observed during El Niño are caused by mortality, dispersion or a combination of both. Generate relevant information for industrial fishery management and policy (define catch quotas and fishery bans based on ecosystem parameters) and monitor targeted prey species. Generate a baseline of health parameters across the species's distribution. Assess whether the current Marine Protected Area (MPA) system effectively protects penguins, and establish further MPAs around strategic colonies to secure feeding grounds of penguins, at least during the breeding season. At colonies where MPAs already exist, enforcement should be coupled with management plans and measurable objectives, so that conservation practitioners can monitor the efficiency of MPAs and adapt to changes as necessary. It is urgent to reduce bycatch in gillnets along the entire distribution of the species. The industrial anchovy fishery is a threat to Humboldt Penguins, so total allowable catches should be set based on trophic and oceanographic models that include ecological parameters and a precautionary approach, reducing fishing pressure during El Niño years. Implement a sustainable guano harvest method in order to minimize disturbance at the breeding colonies and better preserve nesting habitat. Continue eradication of invasive species, particularly rats. Develop educational programmes on fish and seabird conservation for adults and children to better understand economic and conservation trades-offs with human well-being. ",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The likely causes of the decline are ongoing habitat loss and degradation and potentially illegal trapping for the pet trade, as well as range contractions caused by climate change. The species therefore qualifies as Endangered. A recent estimate of the population size is urgently needed.","It inhabits temperate conifer, mature pine-oak, pine and fir forests at 1,200-3,600 m, but breeds from 2,000 to 2,700 m (Monterrubio-Rico et al. 2006). It nests in tree-cavities (especially in pine snags and Pseudotsuga menziesii [M. A. Cruz-Nieto in litt. 1998; Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004]), often originally excavated by woodpeckers. The selection of tree species in which pairs nest appears to shift in reaction to changes in local availability (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). Breeding coincides with the peak in production of pine-seeds, which are the species's primary food resource (Ortiz Maciel and Cruz Nieto 2004). The egg-laying period is mid-June to late July (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). Flocks roost on cliffs, but reintroduced birds have used trees. Outside the breeding season, it is nomadic in response to variations in cone abundance.","Less than 0.06% remains of the original old-growth forest cover in the Sierra Madre Occidental ecoregion (Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto 2004). Historically, there has been an extensive modification of old-growth pine forests for timber and woodpulp. In the Sierra Madre Occidental, 80-85% of forest cover remains, but only 0.6% is old-growth (Lammertink et al. 1996). In 1994, there was extensive penetration and degradation of habitat in south Chihuahua by drug-growers, loggers and huge numbers of cattle. In the same year, forest stands at Mesa de Guacamayas were heavily burned (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). Logging has been intensive in the Sierra Madre Occidental, with no large fragments of old growth forest remaining in northern areas (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). Commercial logging in the area involves the removal of larger trees and standing dead wood, and appears to reduce nest-site availability by leaving few snags and pine trees large enough for the species to nest in. Such large-scale logging operations across the species's historic range may be responsible for its decline (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). As a result of habitat loss, the breeding strongholds are now concentrated in two areas; Cebadillas de Yahuirachi and Madera (Monterrubio-Rico et al. 2006). Fire remains a serious threat to the species (M. A. Cruz-Nieto et al. in litt. 2007). Illegal trade in the species has fluctuated with peaks in the early 1970s and mid-1980s. Unofficial records confirm that the species is taken for illegal trade, but the extent of trapping is not known (M. A. Cruz-Nieto et al. in litt. 2007). Climate change may have an impact on habitat availability for this species, particularly during the breeding season: depending on the climate change scenario, the climatically suitable area for the species may shrink to only 25-70% of the current extent by 2090 (Monterrubio-Rico et al. 2015).","In 2004, the population was thought to number 3,000-6,000 individuals, although more recent systematic counts gave a potential global population of 2,097 individuals (Cruz-Nieto et al. 2012). According to Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto (2004), an estimate of up to 140 nests in the Bisaloachic-Cebadillas region represented c.10% of the total known breeding population then, which equates to 2,800 mature individuals. However, these figures may represent an over-estimate, as not all of the nest cavities surveyed are used every year (M. A. Cruz-Nieto et al. in litt. 2007). Surveys in 2011 found 177 breeding pairs, estimated to be potentially 42% of the breeding population (Cruz-Nieto et al. 2011), which equates to roughly 840 mature individuals. Systematic counts in 2012 gave a potential global population of 2,097 individuals (Cruz-Nieto et al. 2012). The total population is here therefore placed in the band 840-2,800 mature individuals. A more recent estimate of the population size is however required.Due to its migratory behaviour, the species is assumed to function as one subpopulation.",Decreasing,"Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha is largely restricted to the Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico, in north-east Sonora, west Chihuahua, south and west Durango and Michoacán (two collected in April 1987 and 200 birds in April-May 1990 [J. Salgado in litt. 1998; specimens in UMSNH per A. T. Peterson in litt. 1999] are the first records since 1941). Smaller, occasional or extirpated populations have occurred in Sinaloa and Jalisco. At least part of the population undertakes seasonal migrations to the states of Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima and Michoacán during the non-breeding season (Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto 2004). Pre-1960 records of Rhynchopsitta parrots from Coahuila, México and Veracruz may pertain to wanderers. It formerly occurred in U.S.A., in Arizona and New Mexico, but had disappeared by the early 1990s (Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto 2004). Attempts to establish a reintroduced population in Arizona have not proved successful (Snyder et al. 1999).",The species is hunted and trapped for the cagebird trade.,Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix I and II and protected in the USA. The species is managed as part of the Association of Zoos and Aquaria's Parrot Taxon Advisory Group (Parrot TAG) and has been the subject of field studies since 1994. A permanent research team, located in the Sierra Madre Occidental ecoregion, monitors nesting sites and studies its breeding biology (Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto 2004) with the goal of developing sustainable forest management practices that incorporate the species's needs (Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto 2004). Breeding or foraging sites at Tancítaro, El Carricito, Monte Oscuro, Mexiquillo, Las Bufas and Cebadillas have varying degrees of protection (Lammertink et al. 1996; J. M. Lammertink in litt. 1998; J. Salgado in litt. 1998; E. C. Enkerlin-Hoeflich in litt. 2000; Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). In 2003-2004, the Madera nesting area (the second most important breeding area) was in the process of being declared a National Forest Reserve, and efforts were underway for the protection of Mesa de Guacamayas (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). In 2002, a moratorium on timber extraction was signed by the Tutuaca Ejido at Bisaloachia (Cebadillas), which will protect 10% of the breeding population for 15 years (Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2000; Lurie and Snyder 2001; Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto 2004). The agreement involves reimbursement of half of the value of the uncut timber to the ejido by NGOs, whilst the same organisations will also assist the community in recouping the other half of the value through alternative income sources (Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto 2004). Such agreements are being promoted in the Madera region and to the Conoachi Ejido (Ortiz-Maciel and Cruz-Nieto 2004). Pseudotsuga menziesii is protected in Mexico (M. A. Cruz-Nieto in litt. 1998). Two captive-breeding facilities in USA have raised 127 chicks to fledging (S. Healy in litt. 1999) but reintroduction attempts have failed owing to disease, the inability to develop flocking behaviour, and predation by raptors.

Adopt forestry policies that have longer rotation cycles and retain snags (e.g. a minimum of five large snags per ha [Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004]). Restore degraded areas to a more mature condition (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004). Implement forestry management practices that recognise the needs of the species (Monterrubio-Rico and Enkerlin-Hoeflich 2004), and incorporate tree species required for nesting and feeding (Monterrubio-Rico et al. 2006).

As such, even if a small proportion of these birds come from the wild, then this would represent a considerable threat to populations (H. Marshall in litt. 2020). This species is also threatened by extensive deforestation occurring throughout its range (Roberts et al. 2020; Global Forest Watch 2021).","The global population size has not been quantified, but it is believed to be large as the species is described as common in at least parts of its range (Robson 2000).",Decreasing,"This species has a large range extending from northern India, Nepal and southern China south to Sri Lanka and Indonesia.

In Singapore, captive-breeding programmes are also in place to supply demand for the songbird trade (Roberts et al. 2020). Conservation Actions ProposedFurther research is urgently required on population size and trends, including research on ecological behaviours such as territoriality and breeding success (Roberts et al. 2020). The potential negative association of the species across its introduced range in Hawaii also requires monitoring, including investigation of the likelihood for avian malaria transmission to native species.

Overall rates of decline are however difficult to assess, but the species is estimated to have undergone rapid declines over the past three generations. It is therefore listed as Vulnerable.","It nests in colonies on islets or islands at low altitude, often coral atolls or volcanic islands, and feeds mainly on squid, supplemented by fish and crustaceans; it may obtain much food by following cetaceans (Holyoak and Thibault 1984, Carboneras 1992). Records on land are up to 475 m above sea level (GBIF.org 2022).","Invasive species represent a significant threat to the Phoenix Petrel. Feral cats represent the largest threat (Pierce et al. 2015). The Polynesian Rat Rattus exulans does not seem to predate the species on Hatuta’a Island (Gangloff et al. 2009), but eradications on islets around Christmas Island has resulted in dramatic population increases (R. Pierce in litt. 2016). The introduction of the House Rat Rattus rattus to Christmas Island in the 2000s is of considerable concern (Pierce et al. 2015), but its spread seems to have been relatively slow and it was not thought to have reached breeding islets by 2015 (R. Pierce in litt. 2016). Yellow Crazy Ants also represent a possible threat, with ants known to cause nest abandonment in some burrowing seabirds (Plentovich et al. 2018), but it is not known whether they have reached breeding islets. Feral dogs have also been recorded on the island, and rabbits are known to have had some effect but have since been eradicated (Pierce et al. 2008, R. Pierce in litt. 2016). Recent monitoring has indicated that bird hunting on some islets around Christmas Island may have switched to this species due to depletion or abandonment of the sites by larger species, with the impact considered locally unsustainable in the short term (Pierce et al. 2015). Commercial and industrial development is not considered a significant threat to the species as no planned development directly impacts the islets on which the species predominately breeds.Climate change also poses a threat to nesting grounds through sea-level rise and changes in rainfall patterns, which have already affected important seabird nesting areas at Kiritimati (Pierce et al. 2020). ","The most recent estimate for the species's stronghold on Kiritimati is at least 10,000 pairs (Pierce et al. 2020), equivalent to at least 20,000 mature individuals. This is in addition to surveys recording 100 individuals on Hatuta'a in 2010 (Thibault et al. 2013), 12 individuals on Fatu Huku in 2011 (J.-F. Butaud per J.-C. Thibault in litt. 2012), 10 individuals on Canton in 2011 (Pierce et al. 2020), 12-20 pairs on Oeno in 1997-1998 (Bell and Bell 1998, B. Bell pers. comm 1999) and 200 and 300 pairs on Tabu and Upua respectively in 1999 (D. Watling in litt. 1999). The population size is therefore estimated to fall in the band of 20,000-30,000 mature individuals. The subpopulation structure has not been directly analysed. However, as the species breeds on multiple islands, it is tentatively assumed to form multiple subpopulations. Therefore, the largest subpopulation may be that of Kiritimati, and so there may therefore be 20,000 mature individuals in the largest subpopulation.",Decreasing,"Pterodroma alba breeds in the Line and Phoenix Islands (Kiribati), Marquesas Islands (French Polynesia), and Pitcairn Islands (to UK) (c.12-20 pairs on Oeno in 1997 and 1998 [Bell and Bell 1998, B. Bell pers.comm 1999]). In the Line Islands, the stronghold is Kiritimati (= Christmas Island). During the non-breeding season, the species disperses over much of the tropical Pacific as far north as Hawaii and as far south as the Kermadec Islands (Gangloff et al. 2009).","Recent monitoring has indicated that bird hunting on some islets around Christmas Island may have switched to this species due to depletion or abandonment of the sites by larger species, with the impact considered locally unsustainable in the short term (Pierce et al. 2015).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayOn Kiritimati, a cat eradication programme has failed to limit predation by feral cats outside villages (M. Rauzon in litt. 1999, E. A. Schreiber in litt. 1999). There are plans to attract the species to cat-free Jarvis Island National Wildlife Refuge (200 miles from Kiritimati) using acoustic playback recorders (Rauzon 1985). On Oeno and Ducie, the Polynesian Rat Rattus exulans was successfully eradicated in 1997 (B. Bell pers. comm 1999). In the Marquesas Islands, there is work ongoing to keep protected areas free of introduced predators (P. Raust in litt. 2012).

Unless stringent regulations are enforced, these declines are likely to continue. While the population size meets the threshold for Endangered, there is a lack of information on recent rates of population reduction, beyond the inferred continuing decline and suspicion that there are rapid declines occurring. As such the species is listed as Endangered.","It is usually a lowland species, chiefly found below 500 m but occurring locally up to 1,500 m. It has been recorded in many habitats, including towns and villages (where it was formerly one of the most common species), cultivated land (particularly rice-growing areas), grassland, open woodland, tree savanna, beach forest and even mangroves. It is gregarious, especially outside the breeding season. Post-breeding flocks appear to make substantial short-distance movements in response to local food supplies: the loss of abundance may have resulted in considerable fragmentation of the remaining population however the extent to which this is the case is uncertain.","Trapping for the domestic and international cagebird trade has probably been occurring for centuries, peaking in the 1960s and 1970s, and is the main cause of the decline. In central and eastern Java, a survey suggested that up to 38% of adults were trapped each year in 2004-2005, which might rapidly drive these populations to extinction (Yuda 2008). However, there are no estimates of trapping rates over a longer period or for the population on Bali. Overall, the species is traded in large quantities, especially for the markets in Hong Kong, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore and Malaysia (Gilbert et al. 2012, S. Chng in litt. 2016). Its flocking tendency, particularly at roost sites, renders it especially susceptible to mass trapping. Colonies found inside urban buildings (such as hotels and government buildings) may also be susceptible to damage due to renovations (Eaton et al. 2015). Ironically, even feral populations, originally introduced through trade, have subsequently been decimated for the same reason. Historically, it was regarded as a rice crop-pest, and consequently persecuted. Hunting for local consumption, possibly increased use of pesticides, and competition with the ecologically similar Tree Sparrow Passer montanus, are additional threats. The ongoing severe population decline has led to a very low genetic diversity, which renders the species vulnerable to stochastic events and adverse genetic effects (Yuda 2008). The species is prone to parasite infections, especially avian malaria (Yuda 2008).","The number of individuals has been estimated for about half of the global distribution, the central and eastern Java populations. These number 299-889 individuals, most likely not exceeding 1,000 individuals (Yuda 2008). Even though the potentially larger subpopulation on Bali is not included in this estimate, it is very likely that the global population does not exceed 1,500-3,750 individuals in total. The population size is therefore placed in the band of 1,000-2,499 mature individuals. Throughout its range, the population is highly fragmented.",Decreasing,"This species is a native endemic of the islands of Java, Bali, and probably Madura, Indonesia, although it has been widely introduced, with feral populations now established in many parts of the world. It was formerly widespread and abundant in its native range, but numbers crashed during the second half of the 20th Century (BirdLife International 2001). The majority of documented recent records within the native range derive from east Java and Bali, but it is now difficult to find, particularly on Java (N. Brickle in litt. 2012). A repeat survey of 64 former occupied sites located 109 individuals at 17 sites (Muchtar and Nurwatha 2001). This contraction of range appears to be continuing, with surveys in Yogyakarta in 2017-18 failing to find the species at 9 of 14 previously occupied sites (Rosyadi et al. 2019). In January 2020 the 'Big Month' community science event recorded the species in only 20 (0.25%) of the 7,935 tetrads (2 × 2 km squares) visited (T. Squires and S. Marsden in litt. 2020), despite a high level of participation and effort. Feral populations (in Indonesia at least) have apparently declined precipitously. Information from elsewhere is insufficient to estimate its status as a feral species, and all conservation efforts should focus on its original native range.","A popular species in the global pet bird trade. Intensive trapping from the wild due to demand for this trade is thought to have peaked initially in the 1960s and 1970s (BirdLife International 2001), however an estimated 38% of adults were being trapped annually in 2004 and 2005 in central and eastern Java (Yuda 2008). Large numbers are reared in captivity and the species has been domesticated in many stable plumage varieties. The global trade in the species is now thought to be primarily supplied through the captive-bred population, though there is also capture from feral wild-living populations introduced to various countries around the world. The current wild population within the native range is very small and is not believed to be capable of sustaining significant rates of harvest. In addition the species may be trapped for food, though it is unlikely this practice continues to any significant level within the native range. The species was considered a pest of rice-fields when it was abundant and was routinely trapped.",Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayCITES Appendix II. An embargo was placed on the capture quota for Java and Bali in 1995. The species is bred widely in captivity but is heavily trapped, almost to extinction within the natural range. It occurs in only very few protected areas, with recent records from only four: Cikepuh Wildlife Reserve, Baluran and Meru Betiri National Parks on Java, and Bali Barat National Park on Bali. Nest box schemes have been established, particularly in temples such as Prambanan temple complex in Central Java, albeit lack of funding halts any sufficient progress (Eaton et al. 2015). Conservation and Research Actions ProposedInvestigate the relative importance of current threats (excessive trade, persecution, pesticides, competition). Decrease the level of trapping. Promote strict enforcement of trade restrictions in wild birds, and devise means of meeting market demands from captive breeding.

Therefore, the species has been reassessed as Least Concern.","During the breeding season, the species is typically found in grassland with tall and dense grass, dead trees and thick leaf-litter, although site choice is unpredictable from year to year (Dornak et al. 2013). On their wintering grounds, though, birds prefer recently burned areas (Bechtoldt and Stouffer 2005), with low densities of litter and near-ground vegetation (Carrie et al. 2002; Holimon et al. 2008). Optimal fire intervals may vary regionally, possibly due to different rates of litter accumulation in mesic and drier upland savannas (Palasz et al. 2010). They are often associated with longleaf pine Pinus palustris savanna at this time (Plentovich et al. 1999; Bechtoldt and Stouffer 2005; Thatcher et al. 2006), but also occur in saline soil barrens (Holimon et al. 2004, 2008). Mowed fields are generally avoided, as are fields with a lot of woody vegetation (Rising 1996; Holimon et al. 2008).","Wetland draining and destruction of grassland habitat through fire suppression, conversion to agriculture or pine plantations and earlier and more frequent cutting of hayfields (Pruitt 1996; Rising 1996; Cooper 2012) all represent threats, and in combination they have caused population declines in the past. The continued investment in fire suppression programmes could result in reduced funding for prescribed fire in longleaf pine savannas and therefore loss of suitable wintering habitat for this species (United States Department of Agriculture 2015). Further, significant additional U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program grasslands may be converted to agricultural fields if the high price of corn continues, resulting in loss of breeding habitat (Cooper 2012; Lark et al. 2015). This species has been reported to suffer mortality as a result of collisions with communications towers (Longcore et al. 2013). However, given the ongoing population increase, it is uncertain to what extent these threats could be impacting the species currently.","The global population is estimated to number 410,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2019).",Increasing,"Passerculus henslowii breeds in the eastern U.S.A., from Minnesota (primarily in the south-east) east to southern Ontario (Canada) and New York, and extending south-west to north-east Oklahoma, and south-east to north-western Kentucky and West Virginia.

It winters in coastal states from south-east North Carolina south to Florida (except for the southern tip) and west to eastern Texas (AOU 1983; Sibley and Monroe 1990). It was once common in unploughed, periodically burnt tall-grass prairie, which originally stretched from Illinois west to Kansas and Nebraska (Rising 1996), but these populations have been thought to have declined, with the greatest declines being in the northern and eastern portions of the range (AOU 1983). Southern populations, however, have tended to increase (Rising 1996), apparently in association with the creation of undisturbed grassland habitat by the Conservation Reserve Program (Rising 1996; Herkert et al. 2002; Cooper 2012).","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe species is monitored within the North American Breeding Bird Survey and Christmas Bird Count.

It feeds almost exclusively on invertebrates, and forages typically between three and six metres above ground level (Kus et al. 2010). ","Habitat loss and modifications through agricultural spread, grazing, sand and gravel extraction, flood control structures and practices, urban development and spread of invasive vegetation pose threats to the species. Secondarily, high rates of brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater), as a result of habitat structural change, might have caused reductions in breeding populations in south-west USA (Kus et al. 2010, C. McCreedy in litt. 2016). A recently emerged threat is the Polyphagus Shot Hole Borer, an invasive south-east Asian weevil that farms several species of fungi to provision its larvae, one of which frequently goes on to kill the host tree, with the potential for reducing habitat suitability for Bell's Vireo (B. Kus in litt. 2016, Leathers 2015). The species was recorded amongst the many found to suffer mortality from stationary structures during migration, and an estimate of the annual mortality represented in excess of 0.5% of the total population size (Longcore et al. 2013). However, over the last 50 years, the population has increased in North America at a rate of 2.6% annually (T.

Stopping grazing along the San Pedro River in Arizona resulted in recovery of native vegetation and abundance of Bell's Vireo more than doubled (Krueper et al. 2003). Conservation Actions ProposedProtect key habitats for the species, remove invasive plants and restore native vegetation within the species range (Kus et al. 2010).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory, the main routes of migration being along Arctic coastlines (Snow and Perrins 1998). It arrives on the breeding grounds in early-June where it may breed in small, loose colonies or dispersed in single pairs (especially in the high Arctic where the habitat is unsuitable for large groups) (Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo et al. 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Snow and Perrins 1998; Kear 2005). There is a high degree of synchrony in egg laying and hatching, with the adults moulting c.10 days after the young hatch (mid-July to mid-August) during which they become flightless for c.21-30 days (Johnsgard 1978; Scott and Rose 1996). Most individuals moult near the breeding grounds although immatures, unsuccessful breeders and some more southerly breeding groups may undertake pre-moult migrations and form large moulting concentrations well-away from nesting areas (Johnsgard 1978; Flint et al. 1984; Scott and Rose 1996). After the post-breeding moult flocks leave the breeding grounds in early-September with some arriving in wintering areas as early as mid-September, others making stopovers on route and arriving later (Madge and Burn 1988). The species leaves its wintering quarters again from mid-March to mid-April (Madge and Burn 1988). During the non-breeding season the species remains gregarious, gathering in groups of only a few to several thousands of individuals, although it is rarely found in very large flocks (Snow and Perrins 1998; Kear 2005). Habitat Breeding The species breeds in coastal Arctic tundra in or close to wet coastal meadows with abundant grassy vegetation and on tundra-covered flats with tidal streams (only just above the high tide line) (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo et al. 1992; Kear 2005). In some parts of its range it shows a preference for nesting on small grassy islands in tundra lakes and rivers, especially if nesting Sabine's Gulls Xema sabini, Snowy Owls Bubo scandiaca, Peregrine Falcons Falco peregrinus or large raptors are present to deter predators (Johnsgard 1978; Flint et al. 1984; Madge and Burn 1988; Kear 2005). High Arctic nesters may also breed widely dispersed over icy tundra, well-away from water (Kear 2005). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species becomes predominantly coastal, inhabiting estuaries, tidal mudlflats, sandy shores, coastal saltmarshes (especially in the spring) and shallow muddy bays (Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo et al. 1992; Scott and Rose 1996; Kear 2005). In recent years the species has taken to grazing on coastal cultivated grasslands and winter cereal fields, but rarely occurs on freshwater wetlands except on passage (Madge and Burn 1988; Scott and Rose 1996). Diet The species is mainly herbivorous although it may take animal matter (e.g. fish eggs, worms, snails and amphipods) (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding In its breeding habitat the diet of the species consists of mosses, lichens, aquatic plants, sedges, tundra grass Dupontia spp., arrowgrass Triglochin spp. and saltmarsh grass Puccinellia spp. (Alaska), although the young may also take insects and aquatic invertebrates (Johnsgard 1978; del Hoyo et al. 1992; Kear 2005). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species predominantly takes marine microscopic and macroscopic algae (e.g. seaweeds, Ulva spp.) and other aquatic plants linked with saline or brackish waters in the intertidal zone (e.g. especially eelgrass Zostera spp., as well as Ruppia maritima, Spartina alterniflora, Salicornia spp., and arrowgrass Triglochin spp.) (Madge and Burn 1988; del Hoyo et al. 1992; Kear 2005). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression on the ground (Flint et al. 1984; del Hoyo et al. 1992). Although the species often nests close to water (del Hoyo et al. 1992) typically within a few hundred metres of the tideline, high Arctic nesters may breed on icy tundra well away from water (some nearly up to 10 km inland) often near boulders where the snow clears first (del Hoyo et al. 1992; Snow and Perrins 1998; Kear 2005). Management information An investigation carried out in one of the species's wintering areas (UK) found that it was most likely to forage on dry, improved grasslands that had high abundances of the grass Lolium perenne, were between 5 and 6 ha in area, and were at a distance of up to 1.5 km inland or 4-5 km along the coast from coastal roosting sites (Vickery and Gill 1999). The species was found to show a preference for grasslands with short, dense swards c.5 cm in height, a characteristic that can be gained through summer management plans involving either mechanical cutting, livestock (sheep or cattle) grazing regimes, or cutting and then grazing (although over longer periods of time the selective grazing of sheep rather than cattle, and frequent rather than infrequent cutting may be more likely to enhance tillering and produce the short, dense sward favoured by this species) (Vickery and Gill 1999). Fertilising the grassland with nitrogen in the autumn at a rate of 50 kg N/ha was found to increase the overall species use of the habitat by 21% compared with unfertilised areas, and fertilising at a rate of 75 kg N/ha was found to increase the overall species use of the habitat by 9-29% and to remove any preference the geese showed for short sward heights (between 5 and 11 cm) (Vickery and Gill 1999). In other fertilising experiments grazing intensity of the species was found to increase linearly with increasing levels of fertiliser (from 0 kg N/ha to 150 kg N/ha), although responses in grazing intensity at fertiliser levels lower than 50 kg N/ha were found to be short-lived (c.2 months after fertiliser application) (Vickery and Gill 1999).","This species is threatened by hunting (Kear 2005). In its winter range the species may be persecuted by farmers, as in recent years it has increasingly taken to grazing on cultivated grasslands and winter cereal fields near the coast (Scott and Rose 1996). It is further susceptible to disturbance from vehicles, although it is relatively tolerant of human disturbance, e.g. walkers, compared to other species (Vickery and Gill 1999; Burton et al. 2002). Habitat within the breeding range is degraded through the expansion of industrial developments (Lewis et al. 2020). The species may also be threatened in the future by reductions in food supplies following the return of a disease of the eelgrass Zostera marina (a staple food) (Scott and Rose 1996). It can use alternative feeding sources as demonstrated following the collapse of eelgrasses in the Netherlands (1930-1940), but these need to be highly nutritious and diverse. It has been shown that nest success is dependent on fat reserves that have been acquired in the staging areas (Ebbinge and Spaans 1995). The nesting success of breeding pairs in Svalbard is greatly reduced as a result of Arctic fox Vulpes lagopus predation (Madsen et al. 1992), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the virus (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Inbreeding depression has also been identified as a threat to current population growth (Harrison et al. 2011). Nevertheless, these threats seem to have little or no impact on the overall population size. The species however appears susceptible to climate variability, with the probability of breeding being negatively correlated to the sea surface temperature (Sedinger et al. 2006); hence climate change may lead to a reduction in reproductive success in the future.","The global population is inferred to number 490,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2020). The European population is estimated at 1,500-1,800 pairs, which equates to 3,000-3,600 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"","The species is hunted in large parts of its range, mainly for recreation and sport (Lewis et al. 2020).

It has a small area of occupancy and occurs at a small number of locations. Its population size remains small and is composed of small subpopulations. In the absence of continued habitat management and/or predator controls, its area of occupancy, area and quality of habitat, and population size would all likely decline. For these reasons, the species is listed as Near Threatened.","In 1949, the remaining populations on Hawai‘i were restricted to rocky, sparsely vegetated, high volcanic slopes. Historically, the species is likely to have used grasslands, grassy shrublands, and dryland forest (USFWS 2004). It currently occurs in a variety of habitats including golf courses, pastures, lava flows, upland grasslands and shrublands (USFWS). The optimal habitat during the breeding and moulting seasons appears to be lowland grassland, including exotic grassland, where there is an abundance of high protein food, adjacent to natural scrubland nesting areas (Black et al. 1994, Black 1995, Black et al. 1997, Leopold and Hess 2013). During the non-breeding season it prefers subalpine shrubland (Leopold and Hess 2013, 2014). The species is likely to have originally been an altitudinal migrant, nesting primarily in leeward lowlands below 700m, and moving to montane habitats above 900 meters in the non-breeding season (Black 1995, USFWS 2004). Seasonal movements are now being seen in some recovered populations (USFWS 2004, 2011, Hess et al. 2012). Although a weak flier, the species is capable of flying between islands, and there have been several records of individuals flying between Maui and Hawai‘i (Banko and Elder 1990). It feeds on a wide range of plants (Banko et al. 1999). It breeds from August to April, with most eggs hatching in December and January (Banko et al. 1999).","The species originally declined as a result of hunting by Polynesian and non-Polynesian people, habitat loss and the introduction of mammalian predators (USFWS 2004). Currently the main threats are predation by alien mammal species, habitat loss and degradation, and conflict with humans. Examination of carcasses from 1991-2013 found that emaciation, trauma from predation and road collisions, and diseases (predominantly toxoplasmosis) were the biggest causes of death (Work et al. 2015). The introduced small Indian mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus occurs on all range islands except Kaua‘i, and is the main predator of eggs (Banko 1992, USFWS 2004). Eggs are also predated by Black, Norway and Pacific Rats (USFWS 2004). Dogs, mongooses and occasionally cats predate on goslings (Banko and Elder 1990, Banko 1992). Feral pigs trample nests and predate eggs, young and adults (USFWS 2004). Feral cats also carry the protozoan organism Toxoplasma gondii which causes toxoplasmosis, a disease that can be fatal in the species, although it is unlikely to be causing significant population-level impacts (Hess and Banko 2006, Work et al. 2015, 2016, USFWS 2018).A lack of suitable lowland habitat, especially for rearing young, may be an important factor limiting growth (USFWS 2004). The development of agricultural systems by the Polynesians, and later by European settlers, resulted in the extensive loss and alteration of habitat (Olson and James 1991). Lowland habitat continues to be lost through urbanisation and conversion to agriculture (USFWS 2018), and is being degraded through grazing by feral ugulates (cattle, goats and sheep) and by the introduction of alien plant species such as guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus), sword grass (Miscanthus floridulus), koa haole (Leucaena leucocephala), and lantana (Lantana camara; Banko et al. 1999, VanderWerf 2012, USFWS 2018).Road-kills are an important cause of mortality on Hawai‘i (M. Morin in litt. 1999, Rave et al. 2005, Lepczyk et al. 2019) and probably on Maui (A. Marshall, D. Hu and K. Misajon in litt. 2007). Wind farms may also cause mortality of adults, although this is expected to be offset by habitat conservation plans at wind farm sites (USFWS 2011, 2018).Populations have been found to have a low level of genetic diversity, which may affect the species's breeding success (Rave 1995).Severe droughts can cause significant adult mortality, resulting in large population declines, and may become more frequent due to climate change (USFWS 2011, 2018). Climate change may also negatively affect the species through an increased frequency of cyclones, and through sea level rise, which may reduce the amount of available lowland breeding habitat (USFWS 2018). Volcanic activity has the potential to destroy much or all of the habitat at Hawai‘i Volcanoes National Park and surrounding areas, but volcanoes are not considered to represent a threat to the species as a whole (USFWS 2019).","Recent population estimates have included 1,754 in 2006, 2,019 in 2007, 1,900 - 1,950 in 2008, 1,877 - 1,927 in 2009, 1,888 - 1,978 in 2010 (USFWS 2011), 2,465-2,555 in 2011 (VanderWerf 2012), 3,039 in 2015 (Amidon 2017), and 2,855 in 2016 (USFWS 2018). In 2018, the population was estimated at 3,252 individuals, including 1,104 on Hawai‘i (including 598 birds relocated from Kaua‘i), 627 on Maui, 37 on Moloka’i, 1,482 on Kaua‘i and 2 on O‘ahu (USFWS 2018).For some time, all populations were dependent on continued releases of captive birds to persist (USFWS 2004), but releases ceased by the late 2000s (USFWS 2011). The populations on Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i Island and Maui are now considered to be self-sustaining (USFWS 2018). The population on Moloka’i is not yet successfully breeding (USFWS 2019), and so it is excluded from this assessment. In 2011-2016, 640 individuals were removed from a site on Kaua‘i to reduce the risk of bird strike at an airport, and moved to Hawai‘i and Maui (VanderWerf 2012, USFWS 2018).The total population size of all established subpopulations is here placed in the band 2,600 - 3,300 individuals, roughly equivalent to 1,700 - 2,200 mature individuals.Although the species is capable of flying between islands (Banko and Elder 1990), it is assumed that subpopulations on separate islands are largely isolated.",Increasing,"Branta sandvicensis is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.). Fossil analysis suggests that it once occurred throughout the main islands (Olson and James 1991). However, it declined due to habitat loss and alteration, hunting, and and predation by introduced predators (Olson and James 1991), and by 1951 only around 30 wild individuals remained, restricted to Hawai‘i Island (Smith 1952). Following an extensive reintroduction programme beginning in the 1960s, reintroduced populations are now also found on Maui, Kaua‘i and Moloka’i Islands. For some time, all populations were dependent on continued releases of captive birds to persist (USFWS 2004), but releases ceased by the late 2000s (USFWS 2011). The populations on Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i Island and Maui are now considered to be self-sustaining, although they continue to be reliant on predator control and habitat management (USFWS 2018).

The species was listed as Endangered in the USA under the Endangered Species Act from its inception until 2020, when it was downlisted to Threatened status (USFWS 2019). The species benefits from a suite of protected areas, including Hawai‘i Volcanoes and Haleakallâ (Maui) national parks, Kîlauea Point (Kaua‘i) and Hakalau Forest (Hawai‘i) national wildlife refuges, and several state sanctuaries (C. Terry in litt. 1999). The population size is monitored regularly, with separate populations generally monitored separately (USFWS 2004). Captive breeding began in 1949 and the release of captive-bred individuals began in the 1960s, ending in the late 2000s (USFWS 2011). Over 2,800 captive-bred individuals were released on Hawai‘i, Moloka’i, Maui and Kaua‘i (VanderWerf 2012). The populations on Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i Island and Maui are now considered to be self-sustaining, although they continue to be reliant on predator control and habitat management (USFWS 2018). Predators have been controlled at most areas where the species nests (USFWS 2004, VanderWerf 2012), and fences are used to exclude predators from breeding areas at some sites (VanderWerf 2012). Habitat has been restored at key sites through mowing, controlled grazing, control of alien plants and reintroduction of native plants (USFWS 2004). Supplementary food has been provided at some sites (VanderWerf 2012). A range of educational activities have taken place to raise awareness of the species's conservation (USFWS 2004). Press releases, posters, signs and postcards are used to raise awareness of the need for careful driving near nesting sites (USFWS 2018). Agreements have been put in place with private landowners to maintain or improve habitat, control predators and reintroduce the species to their land (USFWS 2004). Conservation and Research Actions ProposedStandardise monitoring protocols and continue to monitor population trends. Continue studies on movement patterns and habitat use. Monitor threats, including collisions with wind turbines. Protect, manage and restore habitat, particularly lowland grasslands on Hawai‘i Island, and ensure habitat connectivity to enable altitudinal migration (USFWS 2004). Control alien predators, including mongooses, rats and cats (Black 1995, Black 1998, Rave et al. 2005, Work et al. 2015). Establish and maintain strict biosecurity protocols to ensure Kaua‘i remains mongoose-free (H. C. Baker and P. E. Baker in litt. 2000, USFWS 2019). Continue education activities to raise awareness of the species's conservation and threats, particularly with regard to road-kills (Black 1995, C. Terry in litt. 1999, Rave et al. 2005).

It is found from sea-level to 2,500 m, but most frequently below 1,500 m (Best et al. 1995). It nests in tree cavities, but the extent to which it tolerates logged forest and can breed successfully in small woodlots or even isolated trees is unclear (Best et al. 1995).

The total population is unlikely to be smaller than 10,000 individuals, with the majority occurring in Ecuador (Best et al. 1995). This roughly equates to 6,700 mature individuals. To account for uncertainty, the population is here placed in the band 2,500-9,999 mature individuals, but detailed study is required.The population likely forms two subpopulation, with a divide in the centre of the range in Guayas, El Oro and Azuay, Ecuador (Best et al. 1995).",Decreasing,"Psittacara erythrogenys occurs from Manabí, north-west Ecuador, south to Lambayeque and Cajamarca, north-west Peru, with the high Andes marking its easternmost limit, at least in Ecuador (Best et al. 1995; Juniper and Parr 1998; Clements and Shany 2001).

Soaring flight is used frequently (Snow and Perrins 1998). It is always seen singly or in pairs (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Habitat It inhabits mature woodland, particularly coniferous, but also deciduous or mixed, preferring areas near clearings and the forest edge (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Diet Small birds and mammals make up the vast majority of its diet, with grouse, pheasants and partridges being especially important in boreal zones (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Breeding site Nests are built on the forks or branches of large trees (del Hoyo et al. 1994), typically in areas with high (60-90%) canopy closure (Squires et al. 2020). Management information The species's optimal habitat appears to be areas of farmland interspersed with mature forest; afforestation has improved its status across parts of its range (del Hoyo et al. 1994).","Significant declines in Europe in the 19th-20th centuries are thought to have resulted from persecution and deforestation, with later declines in the 1950s-1960s a result of poisoning from pesticides and heavy metals. Studies on Northern Goshawk nestlings in Norway show that persistent organic pollutants are still present in plasma, preen oil and feathers, suggesting recent and continuous exposure (Briels et al. 2019). Persecution continues to be a threat, as is nest robbing for falconry (Orta and Marks 2014). It is also highly vulnerable to the impacts of potential wind farm developments (Strix 2012). Timber harvest is a primary threat to nesting populations, with nests and nest stands regularly destroyed or by logging operations, but the impact on breeding success is unknown (Squires et al. 2020, Byholm et al. 2020). Disturbance caused by logging activity near nests can also cause nest failure (Boal and Mannan 1994). In Alaska, U.S.A, clear-cut, even-aged, short-rotation forest management reduces habitat quality for the species, as does removal of old growth forest patches (Iverson et al. 1996). Increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires in western North America are causing a reduction in suitable roosting and foraging sites (Blakey et al. 2020). Declines in some European countries are associated with reduced food supply following intensification of farming and forestry and increased competition for nest sites from Eagle Owls Bubo bubo (Rutz et al. 2006).","The European population is estimated at 234,000-380,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International In prep.). Europe forms approximately 26% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of global population size is 900,000-1,460,000, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

It is therefore listed as Vulnerable.","The species breeds in open lowlands with trees and plenty of insects and small vertebrates, on which it feeds, including steppe and forest-steppe, open woodland, cultivation and pastureland with tall hedgerows or fringing trees, agricultural areas with shelterbelts and, in the north-east, boggy areas and taiga edge. It is usually colonial, breeding in disused nests of other birds (most commonly C. frugilegus), but can also be solitary. It is found from sea-level to c.300 m in the west, but to 1,500 m in Asia (Ferguson-Lees et al. 2001). It is often crepuscular (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is migratory, with birds travelling great distances to their wintering grounds in southern Africa (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Most leave their breeding grounds in August and September, making the return journey between February and June, with a peak in May (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, P. Palatitz in litt. 2016). Birds migrate in a broad front across the Mediterranean Sea, not concentrating at bottleneck sites to the extent that many other raptors do (Brown et al. 1982, del Hoyo et al. 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998), although individuals from Eastern populations can aggregate in large numbers (e.g. Fehérvári et al. 2014). On migration, they form mixed flocks often over 100 strong with other falcons such as F. naumanni, and tend to stay at very high altitudes for the majority of the journey (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The bulk of the population overwinters in the Kalahari region, but exact distributions may vary year to year depending on precipitation, which affects insect abundance (P. Palatitz in litt. 2016). Before the northwards migration it may gather at stopover sites, and returns to the breeding grounds via West Africa and South and East Europe, creating a migration loop (P. Palatitz in litt. 2016).","At the breeding grounds, the greatest threats are loss and degradation of foraging habitats and loss of nest sites (Palatitz et al. 2009). Intensification of agriculture has resulted in conversion of natural habitats to agricultural fields and a decrease in extensive grassland management, especially grazing, reducing the availability of suitable foraging habitats (Palatitz et al. 2009). Widespread use of pesticides further affects food supply (Ferguson-Lees &amp; Christie 2001). This species primarily uses rookeries for colonial nesting throughout their breeding range, therefore threats that affect Rooks (Corvus frugilegus) also affect Red-footed Falcons. The Rook population has declined in many areas due to logging of rookery trees, disturbance and persecution (Ferguson-Lees et al. 2001; Anon. 2007; Palatitz et al. 2009; BirdLife International in prep.). Even in areas where Rook populations are stable, some rooks have shifted to nesting in urban habitats (Palatitz et al. 2009). This has forced the Red-footed Falcon to change its nest site selection habits, becoming heavily dependent on artificial nest boxes in some areas (Fehérvári et al. 2008; Palatitz et al. 2008, 2015). As productivity is generally greater in larger colonies, further decreases may occur in the absence of conservation efforts (Ferguson-Lees &amp; Christie 2001). The species appears to be hunted opportunistically during migration. In October 2007, 52 birds that had been roosting at Phasouri, Cyprus, were found shot (BirdLife International 2007, Palatitz et al. 2009). Illegal killing or harvest has also been reported in Ukraine (Yaremchenko et al. 2009), Malta (Fenech 2010; N. Fenech in litt. 2021) and Angola (Palatitz et al. 2019). ","The European population, forming c.40% of the global population, is estimated to be 115,000-160,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).

The species is also included in agro-environmental programs in Hungary. Following surveys in Bulgaria, which indicated a decline in the number of suitable breeding sites, over 100 nest boxes were constructed and installed in suitable places during 2006; however, none were used by the species in 2007 (Anon. 2007).

In Finland, high proportions of spruce forest and agricultural land in the landscape are associated with greater reproductive success, possibly due to higher small mammal numbers, although birds avoid hunting in large open areas such as agricultural fields (Korpimäki &amp; Hakkarainen 2012). Old-growth forest is particularly important for lifetime reproductive success, potentially because it maintains higher prey numbers and refuges against large avian predators (Korpimäki &amp; Hakkarainen 2012).","The breeding population of this species fluctuates with vole cycles and the depth of annual snow cover, which inhibits foraging. Forestry can reduce primary prey populations, remove forest structure necessary for foraging, and eliminate nest cavities (Holt et al. 1999). Old-growth forest is particularly important - significant declines in northern Europe since the 1990s have been associated with loss of old-growth boreal forest due to clear-felling  (Korpimäki &amp; Hakkarainen 2012). At one time the species frequently used old Black Woodpecker (Dryocopus martius) holes in Eurasia but declines in the species has resulted in less nesting opportunities (Mikkola 1983). Tawny owls (Strix aluco) and martens (Martes spp.) are serious predators of this species and in some years the latter can destroy a high percentage of broods and kill many females on the nest. In Germany, the Nuthatch (Sitta europea) may reduce the size of nest-hole entrances with plastered mud and has even been known to wall in brooding females, resulting in the birds starving to death. It is also vulnerable to pesticides (König et al. 2008).","Rich et al. (2004) estimated the global population to number &gt; c.1,700,000 individuals which equates to 1,130,000 mature individuals.

It is uncommon to scarce across its range. In general, the species is sedentary, with juveniles dispersing as far as 1000km in their first few years. Birds occupying the mostly northerly regions (&gt;65°N), such as Alaska, northern Canada, Fennoscandia and northern Russia, migrate south. In the Nearctic there are southwards movements to southern Alaska and southwest USA in September, via regular flyways, in particular through southwest Alberta. In the Palearctic, movements occur in a broad front to wintering areas in southeast Europe, the Russian steppes, Mongolia, northern China and Japan. Juveniles and immatures will go as far as North Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). Habitat The species occupies a wide range of flat or mountainous, largely open habitats, often above the tree line, from sea level to 4000m. In the Himalayas it has been recorded as high as 6200m (Watson, 2010). Diet The species’s diet is very broad, taking mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, amphibians, insects and carrion variously, depending on the regional prey availability. Prey taken are usually 0.5-4.0 kg and the species can hunt in pairs or small groups (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). Breeding Site Nesting occurs on cliff ledges and where these are not available, in large trees or similar artificial structures. In central and southeastern Mongolia, birds regularly nest on the ground (Ellis 2020). Nests are constructed from sticks and are added to in successive years, growing to 2m in diameter. The breeding season spans March – August throughout the majority of its range, and in southern areas begins as early as November; whilst in the most northerly regions it will start as late as April (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001).","The species was heavily persecuted in the 19th Century, and although this threat has diminished significantly with populations now generally stable, the species is still deliberately poisoned, shot and trapped (for example in landscapes dominated by grouse moors in Scotland [RSPB 2017]). In the past the species was affected by the use of organochlorine pesticides although this is not a significant problem today. There are, however, recent reports of high exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in the USA (Niedringhaus et al. 2021). The relationship between stock grazing and Golden Eagle populations is complex - both undergrazing as a result of grassland abandonment and overgrazing have been reported as threats by various European countries (pressures and threats data reported by EU Member States under Article 12 of the Birds Directive for the period 2013-2018). Electrocution from power lines has been reported as one of the primary causes of anthropogenic mortality in North America - Golden Eagles regularly perch on distribution poles supporting energised equipment (Dwyer et al. 2020), and the USFWS (2016) estimated that 504 Golden Eagles are electrocuted annually. Wind energy developments are a source of direct mortality for the species, particularly in California where wandering sub-adults are mostly affected (Watson 2010).  Future developments in flyways may affect migrating adult eagles, and locally may cause effective habitat loss and lead to collisions (Katzner et al. 2012b). In addition, afforestation, long term changes in food supply, including reduced livestock carrion through changing management practices, and climate change (for example drought [Smith et al. 2020]) may threaten the species in future (Watson 2010). Within the Mediterranean region, declines in rabbit populations as a result of Viral Haemorrhagic Pneumonia may have a negative effect on productivity (Fernández 1993).","The Partners in Flight Science Committee (2020a) estimate the global population to be 130,000 individuals, which equates to approximately 87,100 mature individuals.

Key threats to their habitat include conversion of open habitats to agriculture (including drainage of land); conversion from mixed farming systems to specialised production; overgrazing; commercial and residential development; and afforestation (Wiggins et al. 2020). Wind-turbine developments may impact the species, and assessments of risk of these developments based on diurnal surveys alone may not be representative of the true scale of potential impacts (Calladine and Morrison 2012). Road traffic collisions may also pose a threat (Fernandez-Bellon et al. 2021). This species was shot historically - the current impact of this threat is unknown, but is likely to be much lower than it used to be (Wiggins et al. 2020). Pesticides have been implicated in the death of Short-eared Owls in Israel (Mendelssohn and Paz 1977), but they are not thought be causing significant declines. Skunks have been known to prey on eggs and nestlings (Melvin et al. 1989), and domestic feral cats and dogs may cause disturbance at nest sites (Tate 1992). Increased frequency of extreme weather events caused by climate change may magnify fluctuations in prey populations (Fernandez-Bellon et al. 2021).","The Partners in Flight Science Committee (2020a) estimate the global population to be approximately 2,300,000 individuals, which equates to 1,540,000 mature individuals. The European population is estimated at 84,900-142,000 pairs, which equates to 169,800-284,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.). Europe forms approximately 14% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 1,210,000-2,030,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

However, it may still be an important cause of mortality in some areas, particularly on wintering grounds (Bechard et al. 2020). It also suffers mortality from collisions with cars, electrocution from powerlines (Mebs and Schmidt 2006) and accidental capture in traps set for fur-bearing mammals (Orta et al. 2015). The species may also suffer reduced reproductive success from fluctuating weather caused by climate change (Pokrovsky et al. 2012). An increase in rainfall caused by climate change may increase the risk of nest collapse (Beardsell et al. 2017). In the past, organochlorine pesticide treatments were thought to pose a threat to the species in the U.S.A. (Henny et al. 1984).

It is suspected that it will decline at a rate of 20-30% over three generations in the future as significant threats are ongoing, and some (such as climate change) are predicted to worsen. It therefore qualifies as Vulnerable.","It breeds on sea coasts and inland near larger rivers (mostly on lower stretches) or lakes, where there are stands of mature trees. In the Magadan district of Russia, successful breeding pairs along coasts appear to produce more fledged chicks than successful pairs on rivers, and average brood size is larger for coastal pairs (Potapov et al. 2010, 2012). Annual net chick production showed an increase in constantly monitored coastal sites, but a decrease in river sites (Potapov et al. 2012).  During the autumn birds forage along rivers where dead salmon are abundant. During mid-winter, birds in Russia tend to remain on the coast, except some that winter in Kamchatka along inland rivers fed by hot springs and at Lake Kurilskoye (M. McGrady et al. in litt. 2012), while those wintering in Japan mainly stay near freshwater, but c.35% move to mountainous areas where many feed on deer carcasses (Ueta et al. 2003).","In Russia, it is threatened by habitat alteration during the development of hydroelectric power projects, proposed large-scale coastal and offshore developments for the petrochemical industry, and logging for timber (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Industrial pollution of rivers and high levels of DDT/DDE, PCBs and heavy metals are further threats (Iwata et al. 2000; Kim et al. 1999). Over-fishing has caused a decline of fish stocks in Russia and Japan which has led to an increasing tendency of birds on Hokkaido to move inland and scavenge on sika deer carcasses left by hunters, exposing them to a risk of lead poisoning through ingestion of lead shot (Ferguson-Lees &amp; Christie 2001). Despite laws being introduced in Japan in 2004 prohibiting the use of lead ammunition for hunting large animals, and further laws in 2014 prohibiting possession of lead ammunition, lead poisoning continues to be a significant threat (Ishii et al. 2017).  On Sakhalin Island, the most significant threat to breeding success is nestling predation by brown bears, while other threats include adverse weather (which may form ecological traps on migration routes), food shortages due to overfishing, habitat alteration, disturbance at nest sites, and infection by the blood parasite haemosporida (Romanov and Masterov 2020). Shooting may also be a local threat in parts of the wintering range (GRIN 2021). Declines in reproductive output along the coastline and rivers of the northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk are predominantly caused by increasing frequency and intensity of spring floods, which impede successful hunting and therefore reduce breeding output, and reduced ice cover in spring (Potapov et al. 2018). ","M. McGrady et al.

However, Masterov and Romanov (2014) estimate the global population to be 6,000-7,000, which roughly equates to 4,000-4,670 mature individuals.

Declining breeding success has been noted in the inland river populations of Magadan district, Russia, from 1991 to 2009, with a slow increase in the breeding success of coastal populations over the same period, suggesting that they can be considered sink and source populations respectively (Potapov et al. 2010, 2012).

Information suggests the population has declined rapidly across the majority of its range, and is projected to continue to decline, and it is therefore classified as Vulnerable.","This species requires well-vegetated eutrophic to neutral swamps, marshes, lakes and slow-flowing rivers with areas of open water and abundant emergent fringing vegetation. It also breeds on saline, brackish and soda lakes and occasionally even in sheltered coastal bays (Kear 2005). The breeding grounds are reoccupied from early March (in the south) to early May (in Siberia) (Scott and Rose 1996) with breeding starting from April-May. During the winter the species frequents similar habitats to those it breeds in, including large lakes, slow-flowing rivers, reservoirs, brackish waters, marshes, weirs (Africa) and flooded gravel pits (Brown et al. 1982, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Fox et al. 1994, Scott and Rose 1996). The nest is a depression or shallow cup in a thick heap of vegetation positioned on the ground in shallow water (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998, Kear 2005). As in the breeding season, the species will shift to coastal habitats such as brackish lagoons, tidal estuaries and inshore waters (where it may associate with sewage outfalls [Kear 2005]) when driven by frost or other compelling factors (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species has been recorded to 2690 m in Ethiopia (Ash and Atkins 2009). The species is omnivorous, its diet consisting of seeds, roots, rhizomes, the vegetative parts of grasses, sedges and aquatic plants as well as aquatic insects and larvae, molluscs, crustaceans, worms, amphibians and small fish (Johnsgard 1978, Brown et al. 1982, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Marsden and Bellamy 2000, Kear 2005).Northern populations of this species are highly migratory (Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Those breeding in the milder parts of western or southern Europe are sedentary or only make short-distance movements, often in response to harsh weather conditions (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998), although individuals from some areas, such as France may utilise mulitple localities up to 200 km apart in one winter (Keller et al. 2009, Gourlay-Larour et al. 2012). ","It is thought that the primary factors that have led to the decline in this species are most likely to be a combination of: (i) loss of breeding habitat in eastern Europe, and (ii) changes in water chemistry (especially from hyper-eutrophication caused by agricultural runoff). The loss of habitat is thought to primarily result from changes in land management; either the abandonment or intensification of management of lowland marshes and fish ponds (Fox et al. 2016). The abandonment of traditional lowland grazing marshes results in succession to scrub and other unsuitable habitats, whilst greater agricultural intensification leads to marshes being drained. Negative changes to fish pond management also arise from either a reduction in fish production or an intensification that leads to greater use of fish food and medication treatments, and an increase in nutrient inputs (Fox et al. 2016).The species suffers from predation and nest predation by several introduced and native mammals including American Mink Neovison vison (Bartoszewicz and Zalewski 2003), Raccoon Dog Nyctereutes procyonoides, Raccoon Procyon lotor, Red Fox Vulpes vulpes and Wild Boar Sus scrofa. Increased predation levels may be partly related to declines in Black-headed Gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus colonies, with which Pochard often associate for the benefits of predator deterrence; pochard breeding in association with gull colonies apparently benefit from elevated breeding success and female survival (Fox et al. 2016; Väänänen et al. 2016). Invasive carp Cyprinus carpio may also provide competition for resources with this species, and have been shown to negatively impact the Pochard (Maceda-Veiga et al. 2017). The species may also be threatened by disturbance from hunting (del Hoyo et al. 1992; Evans and Day 2002; Kear 2005; Balmaki and Barati 2006; Sorrenti et al. 2006; H. Ibrahim in litt. 2016), water-based recreation (Fox et al. 1994, Kear 2005) and from machinery noise from urban development (Marsden 2000). Pochard are permitted for hunting in several eastern European states, which selects for breeding females and naïve juveniles (Fox et al., 2016). The European hunting bag for the Pochard remains high in proportion to declining populations across the Continent (Hirschfeld et al., 2019). Brochet et al., (2019) estimates 30,000 birds are illegally killed/taken per year in North &amp; Central Europe and Caucasus, 5% of the population here, with Azerbaijan responsible for the largest number. This amounts to an estimated 2% of the global population. Eggs have also been sold in the UK. Adults are poisoned by ingesting lead shot (Spain) (Mateo et al. 1998), with one estimate that it accounts for the death of 56,511 Pochard in Europe each year (Andreotti et al. in press); and drowned in freshwater fishing nets with mesh sizes greater than 5 cm (China) (Quan et al. 2002). The species is also susceptible to avian influenza, so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the disease (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Emerging threats include climate change and changes to sex ratios. Pochard have a narrow ecological niche, particularly with respect to water conditions which are sensitive to climate change. For example, Jeppesen et al., (2015) highlighted how climate change can synergistically act with water abstraction, leading to salinity increases at wetlands and leaving them unsuitable for Pochard. There is also evidence of an increasingly male-biased sex ratio (Brides et al. 2017), believed to be due to increasing female mortality (suggestions for this include migration stress, and greater predation hunting risk during the breeding season) which may be contributing to global population declines.","The global population is estimated to number 760,000-790,000 mature individuals, which equates to 1.14-1.18 million individuals in total (Wetlands International 2021). Three flyways are identified, with the following population estimates: North-East/North-West Europe with 100,000 mature individuals (150,000 total); Central &amp; NE Europe/Black Sea &amp; Mediterranean with 350,000 mature individuals (530,000 total); Western Siberia/South-West Asia with 310,000-330,000 mature individuals (460,000-500,000 total). The European breeding population is estimated at 89,700-151,000 pairs, which equates to 179,000-302,000 mature individuals or c. 270,000-450,000 total individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).",Decreasing,"The species breeds from western Europe through central Asia to south-central Siberia and northern China (Carboneras and Kirwan 2014).

Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds, for which Waterbird Harvest Specialist Group of Wetlands International (WHSG) (2015) published 'Guidelines on Sustainable Harvest of Migratory Waterbirds'. The cyclical removal of adult fish from an artificial waterbody (gravel pit) in the U.K. attracted nesting pairs to the area by causing an increase in invertebrate food availability and an increase in the growth of submerged aquatic macrophytes. The removed fish (dead or alive) were sold to generate funds (Giles 1994). In the Trebon Basin Biosphere Reserve, Czech Republic, it was found that artificial islands and wide strips of littoral vegetation are the most secure breeding habitats that can be created for the species (nest survival in littoral habitats was improved by reduced nest visibility, increased water depth, and increased distance from the nest to the habitat edge, and nest survival on islands was improved with increased distance to open water) (Albrecht et al. 2006). The use of lead shot in Europe is being phased out, and there is now a CMS resolution for global action (R. Hearn in litt. 2016). The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) adopted in 2000 aims to restore good ecological status to all surface waters by 2027, including the mediation of eutrophication effects (Fox et al., 2016).

Drivers of the decline are uncertain but likely include climate change affecting prey availability, as well as collisions with vehicles and infrastructure. There remains some uncertainty about the overall rate of decline, and if it proves to be even higher the species may be eligible for further uplisting to Endangered.","The species breeds on open tundra from near tree-line to edge of polar seas, with hummocks or rocks and sparse low vegetation and dwarf shrubs and lichen; locally also coastal fields and open moorland, usually at elevations below 300 m, except in Norway (where lemmings occur only on mountains at 1,000 m or higher). In winter, also marshes, fields and dunes (Holt et al. 2017). Lemmings (Lemmus, Dicrostonyx) and other voles (Microtus, Clethrionomys) are major food items, at times probably exploited exclusively; other prey is taken according to availability, include other mammals to size of hares, birds to size of ptarmigans (Lagopus), ducks and medium-sized geese, occasionally fish, amphibians, crustaceans and beetles (Holt et al. 2017).It is generally monogamous and often pairs for life; but with occasional polygyny and polyandry. The nest is a shallow scrape on ground, usually in a slightly elevated site  (Holt et al. 2017). It is most active at dusk and dawn, but forages throughout the day in summer. It is mostly migratory and nomadic, with some remaining in the breeding area all year if conditions allow (Doyle et al. 2017). Movements are unpredictable and related to abundance of prey species; thought to vary considerably from region to region across polar tundra, and intensity of movements fluctuates annually (Doyle et al. 2017; Holt et al. 2017). During years of abundant prey, increased numbers of young Snowy Owls fledge and hence greater numbers therefore migrate south into the USA from their Canadian/Alaskan Arctic breeding grounds to find sufficient wintering territory, a phenomenon known as a 'snowy owl irruption' (Therrien et al. 2017; Curk et al. 2018; Santonja et al. 2019).","Historically, this species was one of the most persecuted owls in North America - thousands of owls were shot for taxidermy, and adults and eggs were hunted for food (Holt et al. 2020). Harvesting of the species for food, feathers and claws by native peoples still occurs but has decreased significantly, therefore while it may have a local impact on populations, it is unlikely to have any wider effect on total numbers. In some areas, nesting habitat may be degraded as a result of urban development (Holt et al. 2009). Snowy Owls getting caught in traps set for foxes may be a significant threat in some areas (Ellis &amp; Smith 1993, cited in Holt et al. 2020), as may secondary poisoning by Warfarin bait set for rats (Campbell &amp; Preston 2009, cited in Holt et al. 2020). Electrocution, aeroplane strikes, collision with vehicles and entanglement in fishing equipment have all been identified as sources of mortality in Alberta, Canada (Holt et al. 2017). Climate change is likely to have a significant impact on the species, as changes in the onset of spring and snowmelt in the breeding areas are likely to affect prey populations (International Snowy Owl Working Group 2010).","Partners in Flight Science Committee (2013) estimated the population to number approximately 200,000 individuals (Partners in Flight Science Committee 2013) (although there is some uncertainty over whether this refers to individuals or mature individuals). However, Potapov and Sale (2013) presented a 'Loose Boid’ method of estimating population size which gives far lower figures. They concluded that instead of being evenly distributed across the tundra, snowy owls could be found in seven different loose 'boids': very thinly distributed groups which move throughout given areas in line with conditions, especially food availability. The largest of these boids was suggested to be in central northern Canada and could contain 4,000 pairs. In total, they estimated that, on average, each boid may contain 2,000 pairs and so the global population size would be c.14,000 pairs or 28,000 mature individuals, which fits with a maximal estimate of 14,000 females suggested by DNA analyses by Marthinsen et al. (2009). However, they also suggested that the population size could be as low as 7,000-8,000 pairs (Potapov and Sale 2013). Satellite tracking projects in the Canadian Arctic and Norway have documented extensive individual movements, further suggesting that the population may have been overestimated in the past (R. Solheim and G. Gauthier in litt. 2017).The European population is estimated at 1,200-2,700 pairs, which equates to 2,400-5,400 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).",Decreasing,"This species has a huge range across predominantly arctic regions from western Scandinavia through northern Russia to Alaska (USA), northern Canada and Greenland (Denmark), and has also bred occasionally in Iceland and the UK.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour Birds are highly migratory in the temperate and Arctic parts of its range, moving from North America to South America, Europe to Africa, and northern Asia to southern Asia and Indonesia. Those breeding at lower latitudes or in the Southern Hemisphere tend to be resident (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Migrating birds leave their breeding sites between August and November, and return between March and May (Snow and Perrins 1998). Migrants readily fly over expanses of sea and ocean. Most birds travel singly or in pairs, even on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Habitat It inhabits an extreme variety of habitats, tolerating wet and dry, hot and cool climates, from sea level up to c.4,000 m (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Diet Birds make up most of its diet, principally pigeons and doves (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Breeding site Eggs are usually laid in a scrape or depression in a rock face, with no nest being built (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Management information Populations recovered following the ban of harmful hydrocarbons in most countries, which appears important to the birds’ survival (del Hoyo et al. 1994).","Historically, the species was affected by shooting in the U.K., notably during the Second World War (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Persecution throughout its range was the major threat in the 19th and early 20th centuries (Snow and Perrins 1998). While persecution has decreased significantly since the species received legal protection, illegal persecution still occurs in some areas, for example four Peregrines were confirmed illegally poisoned and nine shot, trapped, or nests destroyed in the UK in 2014 (RSPB 2014). Severe population declines in the 1960s-1970s were driven by eggshell breakage and mortality of adults and embryos from the hydrocarbon contamination associated with pesticides of that time (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, White et al. 2013). The species is used extensively in falconry, although the population-level impacts of this are uncertain (White et al. 2013). Rock climbing activities may pose a threat to the species's nest sites (Global Raptor Information Network 2015), and careless methods of field study may result in abandonment of eggs (White et al. 2020). In its West African range, the species may be vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing and burning as well as exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007). In North Africa, the main threat to the species is illegal trapping and collection of nestlings for use in falconry (Garrido et al. in prep). It is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012), and collision or electrocution from electricity cables may be common in some areas (White et al. 2020). An oil spill in northern Spain was thought to have reduced reproductive success and caused adult mortality in the local population (Zuberogoitia et al. 2006). Urban fledglings are at threat from collisions with cars, windows and other man-made objects (White et al. 2020). Warming of sea temperatures may reduce plankton and associated seabirds that serve as a food source for some populations of Peregrine Falcons (Nelson &amp; Myres 1976).","Partners in Flight Science Committee (2020) estimate the population in the USA/ Canada to be c.72,000 individuals. The North African population is estimated to be 2,290-2,900 pairs (Garrido et al. in prep.). The European population is estimated at 16,100-31,100 pairs, which equates to 32,200-62,100 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.). Europe forms approximately 13% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 248,000-478,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed.

In parts of Fennoscandia, intensive hunting of grouse (Tucker and Heath 1994), such as Ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) and Willow Grouse (Lagopus lagopus) may affect numbers of this species. In the past, Arctic Fox (Vulpes lagopus) trapping was the main threat in Russia (Potapov 2011). Disturbance of nests through tourism is also a problem (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997). The species is also threatened by climate change (Booms et al. 2011). It was not affected by organochlorines in the 1960s and 1970s (White et al. 2013), however it was found to contain very high levels of organochlorines which probably derive from marine prey (Ólafsdóttir et al. 2001). In Russia, disturbance caused by oil pipeline installation may pose a threat in some regions, however in others abandoned oil extraction rigs provide new nesting sites and may therefore be beneficial (Potapov 2011). Development of the oil industry also facilitates development of roads, which make it easier for illegal bird trappers to access nests (Potapov 2011).","Partners in Flight (2020) estimate the population in Canada and the USA to be c.42,000 mature individuals, and the global population to be c.83,000 mature individuals.

Birds leave their breeding grounds between August and October, arriving at wintering quarters from late October onwards. The return journey begins in March and April, and breeding territories are occupied again in May and June.  Birds are usually seen singly or in pairs or family groups, even on migration, with larger groups being rare except at roosts and especially rich feeding sites (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It migrates in broad fronts and does not generally concentrate at narrow sea crossings as do many other migratory raptors (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Snow and Perrins 1998). It is mainly diurnal although partly crepuscular and even nocturnal to some extent on migration (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Habitat It occurs in open wooded areas, and has been recorded up to 4,000 m (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Diet Flying insects form the main part of its diet, although birds are often taken in the breeding season (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Breeding site Birds almost always nest in trees, using abandoned nests of other raptors or corvids (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Management information The species requires trees in which to nest, so although preferring generally open areas in the breeding season it will avoid those that are completely deforested (del Hoyo et al. 1994).","The cutting of old growth forest patches in Ukraine is thought to have caused local declines (Orta et al. 2020). Agricultural intensification poses a threat through removal of nesting trees and reduction of prey availability such as insects and farmland birds (Sergio et al. 2001). Shooting is a significant cause of mortality during migration, notably in Malta where hunters are thought to kill 500-600 individuals each year (Sultana 1996, cited in Sergio et al. 2001). A growing threat is human disturbance associated with silvicultural and hunting activities during the breeding season (Sergio et al. 2001). Pesticide use has likely had only minor impacts, as has egg-collecting, which tends to be a local issue (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species is highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012). Large increases in Goshawk populations in some countries has led to higher predation rates of both Eurasian Hobby and corvid species, causing direct mortality and reducing the availability of nest sites (Sergio et al. 2001). Persecution of corvids may deplete the availability of nesting sites locally and can lead to unintentional killing (Sergio et al. 2001).","The European population is estimated at 140,000-219,000 pairs, which equates to 280,000-437,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).

Migrant birds leave their breeding grounds between August and October, and those arriving in sub-Saharan Africa do so from October onwards (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The return journey begins from February through until April (the exact time probably dependent on food availability), and is often undertaken in small mixed groups with F. naumanni and occasionally F. vespertinus (Brown et al. 1982, Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species can be solitary or gregarious, being most often seen singly but sometimes travelling in flocks of up to 10 individuals, especially on migration. Larger groups may congregate at sources of abundant food. It is mainly diurnal (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Habitat The species tolerates a wide range of open and partially forested habitats, and has been recorded up to 4,500 m (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Diet It feeds mainly on small mammals, particularly in northern Europe, with insects possibly more important in Africa and the Mediterranean (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Breeding site The locations of nests are variable, with rock ledges, buildings and abandoned corvid nests being commonly reported sites (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Management information Birds require suitable perches and roosting sites, usually provided by trees, telegraph poles, buildings or rock faces (del Hoyo et al. 1994).","Past population declines resulted from the heavy use of organochlorine and other pesticides in the 1950s-1960s (Orta and Boesman 2013).

In Malta, the species was exterminated by shooting, though it has since returned (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The population in much of the rest of Europe has shown a more recent steady decline, thought to be due to agricultural intensification (Snow and Perrins 1998). In its West African range, the species is vulnerable to habitat degradation through wood harvesting, overgrazing and fire as well as exposure to pesticides (Thiollay 2007). The species is vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012).

Migrants begin moving to lower latitudes in August and arrive by October, returning in March and April (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Birds are generally solitary and usually migrate alone, but may congregate in small groups at roosts or plentiful food sources (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). The species migrates on broad fronts and is not dependent on land bridges during migration (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001); birds readily cross bodies of water using flapping flight, but can soar easily over land. It is entirely diurnal (Brown et al. 1982). Habitat It inhabits the areas around shallow waters, being sufficiently tolerant of human settlement to persist in suburban and sometimes urban environments (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Diet Almost its entire diet consists of live fish (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Breeding site Birds usually build large nests high in exposed trees (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Management information Reintroduction has helped populations to recover across parts of its range (del Hoyo et al. 1994).","Human persecution was the main historical threat, prevalent from the 18th-20th centuries (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). A combination of deforestation and the collection of eggs and live birds drove the species extinct in Azerbaijan (del Hoyo et al. 1994). In the U.S.A. (and to a lesser extent elsewhere), numbers fell significantly from 1950-1970 as a result of pesticide use, although they are now recovering, as they are in Scotland where the species had been extirpated by collection and hunting (del Hoyo et al. 1994, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Pesticide use has now been reduced to a minor, and largely historical, threat. However shooting still affects many birds on migration in the Mediterranean (Monti et al. 2018b), as well as wintering birds in tropical regions including Latin America and the West Indies (Global Raptor Information Network 2015). A few Australian birds are apparently impacted by local human disturbance (del Hoyo et al. 1994).It is very highly vulnerable to the effects of potential wind energy development (Strix 2012). Since 1979, the effect of human activity on osprey mortality has fallen (De Pascalis et al. 2020), though birds are still at risk of deliberate shooting and entanglement in fish nets (ibid, see also Monti et al. 2018b). Though there is no direct evidence for its effect on osprey populations, intensive trawler fishing is likely to deplete fish stocks and affect prey availability. Other fishing practices are also likely damaging; copper sulphate fishing may lead to poisoning and motor boats may disturb osprey nests (Monti et al. 2013). The scale of these threats is unknown.","The European population is estimated at 9,600-13,600 pairs, which equates to 19,200-27,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep). Europe forms approximately 14% of the global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is 137,000-200,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is needed. It has been listed as regionally endangered in North Africa, where the population has been estimated as lying between 130 and 146 mature individuals (Garrido et al. in prep). The Partners in Flight Science Committee (2021) estimate that the North American population is 400,000 mature individuals.

Its food is vertebrates (fish, mammals and especially birds), from marine, freshwater and terrestrial environments. It is mainly migratory in the north and east of its breeding range, wintering in continental Europe and southern Asia, but sedentary elsewhere. Birds are usually seen singly, or in twos or threes (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001).","Threats that affect this species include loss and degradation of wetlands, human disturbance and persecution, environmental pollution, collision with wind generators (Krone and Scharnweber 2003), and indiscriminate use of poisons. Modern forestry methods reduce the availability of suitable nesting habitat (Orta et al. 2013). Organochlorine pesticide and heavy metal pollution resulted in reductions in breeding success, particularly in the Baltic region (Orta et al. 2013). Although some losses may be taking place in Asian Russia owing to increased logging and oil industry development, these are outweighed by increases in Europe.Accidental lead poisoning from spent ammunition remains a considerable source of mortality in Finland (Isomursu et al. 2018), with other anthropogenic causes of death including collisions with traffic and power lines or deliberate shooting. Overall, this study found that anthropogenic factors accounted for 60% of eagle deaths. Loss of large trees has left a deficit of suitable nesting sites, and increasing habituation to humans has meant that eagles nest closer to cities (Shiraki 2018). This has increased the number of collisions between eagles and traffic, and may be linked to lower breeding success (ibid). Collisions with wind turbines is an additional source of mortality (Heuck et al. 2019; Matsuda et al. 2021), though the risk can be mitigated with adaptive management (Matsuda et al. 2021). Birds are occasionally threatened by outbreaks of avian influenza virus (Krone et al. 2018).","In Europe, the breeding population is estimated to number 10,400-14,600 breeding pairs, equating to 20,900-29,200 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.).

There is evidence of potentially unsustainable harvest levels at migration and non-breeding sites which is the greatest current threat, though conversion of migratory stopover and non-breeding habitat may also be contributing to declines. Confidence in the precision of the estimated decline rate is uncertain, and a potentially significant and variable proportion of the population is not available for sampling by the migratory surveys. Moderately rapid reductions are also evident from eBird data and for the small proportion of the non-breeding season population covered by the Christmas Bird Count. Given the lower rates of reduction evident from other sources, the best estimate for the three-generation rate of reduction is considered to fall between 23% and 49%. The population remains large, estimated at 650,000 mature individuals and the range is very large. Based on the rate of population reduction, Lesser Yellowlegs is assessed as Vulnerable.","Lesser Yellowlegs breeds around wet habitats in the boreal forest and taiga zone (Tibbitts and Moskoff 2020). All individuals migrate, many travelling to southern South America to winter in freshwater and saline wetlands, estuaries, saltmarshes and wet agricultural fields (COSEWIC 2020, Tibbitts and Moskoff 2020, McDuffie et al. 2022, Fink et al. 2023). Often occurs in human-made habitat during migration and in the non-breeding areas, including salt-extraction sites and sewage treatment lagoons (Tibbitts and Moskoff 2020). It is considered monogamous and breeding can commence from one year old; there is typically a single clutch of four eggs (Tibbitts and Moskoff 2020).Feeds primarily on aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, occasionally taking small fish and seeds (Tibbitts and Moskoff 2020).Habitat loss and degradation, largely through conversion to agricultural use or intensification in the key areas highlighted (especially south-eastern South American wetlands and the north-eastern coast of South America) are inferred to be causing a continuing decline in available habitat and habitat quality (COSEWIC 2020). There has been a rapid increase in the proportion of the Argentine Pampas converted to annual crops, especially soy beans with a 45 % in cultivated area between 1990 and 2006 (Miñarro and Bilenca 2008, COSEWIC 2020).","The large distances travelled by this fully migratory species over the course of the annual cycle expose it to a variety of threats, from habitat shifting due to climate change in northern breeding areas to habitat loss and degradation and hunting during migration and in non-breeding areas. Possibly the most severe threat is due to unsustainable harvest, predominately during the post-breeding migration in the Caribbean and northern South America (AFSI 2016, 2020, COSEWIC 2020, Tibbitts and Moskoff 2020). A minimum of 18,316–46,940 individuals are estimated to be harvested annually (Rivera-Milán et al. 2023), based on the following values; Martinique 1,118–5,741; Guadeloupe 1,982–2,513; Barbados 6,100–9,150; Guyana 1,283–2,386; and Suriname 7,833–27,150. Additional take may occur in Brazil and French Guiana (Rivera-Milán et al. 2023). A preliminary Potential Biological Removal (PBR) estimate for the species was set at 79,450 ± 20,562 (Watts et al. 2015), but this has been updated using a Prescribed Take Level framework which estimates a lower range between 5.000 ± 1,945 (SD) individuals to 38,910 ± 13,238, suggesting that the species is indeed being overharvested (Rivera-Milán et al. 2023). For Guyana, Andres et al. (2022) found levels of hunting have likely decreased and at a minimum has not increased in the past two decades.Reductions recorded in northern South America have at least in part been ascribed to a loss of suitable intertidal mud habitats following the clearance of mangroves in Suriname and Guyana (Lesterhuis 2021, Andres et al. 2022). Population level impacts are likely negligible, with individuals expected to relocate although this is expected to represent an overall reduction in available suitable non-breeding habitat. Coastal defence work has also reduced the area of suitable intertidal habitat within the very large range of the species (COSEWIC 2020), but it is not clear that the amount of this habitat is a limiting factor for the species. However there has been considerable loss and degradation of wetland habitat largely through conversion to agricultural use or intensification in other key non-breeding and migratory staging sites, especially south-eastern South American wetlands (COSEWIC 2020). Much has been lost to the planting of crops, for example there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of the Argentine Pampas converted to annual crops, especially soy beans with a 45 % in cultivated area between 1990 and 2006 (Miñarro and Bilenca 2008, COSEWIC 2020).Climate change is thought to be causing significant changes to the breeding habitat that may already be affecting reproductive success, principally through the drying of wetlands (Carroll et al. 2011). There may also be a temporal mismatch in peak prey abundance and breeding timings as noted for other boreal nesting waders which may impact reproductive output (Galbraith et al. 2014), but this has not been demonstrated to affect the species as yet.Native predators, notably Red Fox Vulpes vulpes, have expanded their range and are now more abundant within the breeding range of Lesser Yellowlegs (COSEWIC 2020). It is suspected that rates of nest predation and potentially rates of adult mortality during breeding have increased as a result, but there is no evidence of this as yet and the severity of the threat is considered unknown (COSEWIC 2020).","The global population is estimated to be at 650,000 mature individuals (Andres et al. 2012), though a modelling approach suggested 7.6 million mature individuals in Canada alone (BAM 2020). However, COSEWIC (2020) consider this likely overestimates true density because of birds approaching observers during point counts. But it is conceded that densities in the favoured habitat of 5.6 per square kilometre are similar to the 2-3 pairs per square kilometre generated by territory mapping surveys (Cooper 2004, COSEWIC 2020). The species is not covered by the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) surveys as it breeds further south, but the observation that these systematic surveys typically increased estimates significantly does suggest the current population size may be conservative.Earlier estimates were substantially lower: Morrison et al. (2006) give a population estimate of 400,000 birds, with a range of 300,000–500,000.",Decreasing,"This migratory shorebird breeds from extreme eastern Siberia, Russia, through much of Alaska, United States of America (USA) south of the north slope, and through north central Canada from the coastal Northwest Territories, Yukon, northern British Colombia east to Hudson Bay and James Bay (Tibbitts and Moskoff 2020, Fink et al. 2023). The majority of the population spends the non-breeding season in south-eastern South American wetlands, including at high elevation in the Andes, and around the coast of northern and northeastern South America, though a proportion remain in southern USA, in the Caribbean and along the Pacific and Gulf coasts (Tibbitts and Moskoff 2020, McDuffie et al. 2022, Fink et al. 2023). Those breeding in eastern Canada stop off on southbound migration initially on the Atlantic coast of Canada, then many make a direct multi-day transoceanic crossing through the Caribbean to important areas along the north-eastern coast of South America. From here some continue to sites in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay (McDuffie et al. 2022, Tibbitts and Moskoff 2020). Variable numbers from this source take a less oceanic route along the eastern seaboard of the USA at sites along the east coast of the United States (McDuffie et al. 2022). Those breeding further west in central Canada and Alaska pass through the Prairie Potholes region in the midwest of the USA before many again pass through the Caribbean and northern South America on their way again to the south-eastern South American wetlands, though especially those from Alaska pass through the Gulf of Mexico and Central American countries south along the Andes (McDuffie et al. 2022). During the pre-breeding northbound migration the Mississippi alluvial plain is a key stopover area for birds that winter in the south eastern South American wetlands, but many also stop in Mexico (McDuffie et al. 2022).","A minimum of 18,316–46,940 individuals are estimated to be harvested annually (Rivera-Milán et al. 2023), based on the following values; Martinique 1,118–5,741; Guadeloupe 1,982–2,513; Barbados 6,100–9,150; Guyana 1,283–2,386; and Suriname 7,833–27,150.

In Trinidad and Tobago a ban on all waterbird hunting was enacted in 2019 (AFSI 2020). On Martinique a bag limit (of 20 individuals per day) was imposed for the first time in 2020 (Birds Caribbean 2021). Harvest in Barbados was limited to 10,000 birds annually from 2012 as a result of initial findings into hunting pressure (Wege et al. 2014).Migratory stopover habitat is largely identified and protected under the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN), although this offers no legal protection. The Atlantic Flyway Shorebird Initiative (AFSI) has identified and undertaken a series of measures to address unsustainable harvest in the Caribbean and northern South America (AFSI 2016, 2017, 2020).

A preliminary estimate of the harvest in Guyana has been made (Andres et al. 2022), allowing an assessment of annual harvest level against likely sustainable take (Rivera-Milán et al. 2023).Lesser Yellowlegs is monitored via the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) (Ziolkowski Jr. et al. 2022) although this covers only a small proportion of the breeding range; by the Christmas Bird Count (Meehan et al. 2022) which does not cover the main wintering areas; by the International Shorebird Survey during migration (Brown et al. 2001, Smith et al. 2023); and partly covered by the International Waterbird Census during the non-breeding season (Wetlands International 2023).Conservation Actions NeededImproved monitoring of key non-breeding sites is required. The biological and social aspects of harvest across the countries for which there is significant harvest in the species need to be fully assessed (AFSI 2016). In particular further research into harvest levels is needed in Suriname, Brazil, French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Saint-Martin and Saint Pierre and Miquelon (AFSI 2020). Increase communication among stakeholder organizations and agencies to develop a regional approach to managing shorebird harvest (AFSI 2016). Efforts are needed to convince national governments in key countries to invest in cooperative shorebird conservation efforts, linked to multinational agreements to secure the status of migratory species. The provision of sufficient salary, equipment, travel, capacity, and training is needed to effectively enforce existing laws and policies where shorebird harvest is illegal. Where harvest is legal, enforcing seasonal regulations and monitoring voluntary compliance is required. Based on assessment results from areas where shorebird harvest is legal, regulations and policies addressing harvest management components, such as the number of licensed hunters, daily and seasonal bag limits, and season timing and duration, may need to be developed to ensure a sustainable harvest. Harvest of shorebirds of conservation concern may also be restricted through enactment of policies, regulations, domestic legislation, or international agreements (AFSI 2016). Consult with the Barbados Wildfowlers Association on further lowering bag limits for the species, and delaying the start of the season to reduce the take of adult birds (Wege et al. 2014). Establish and maintain No-Shooting Reserves by purchasing and restoring defunct shooting swamps on Barbados and private wetlands on other islands or by establishing no-shooting reserves on public lands: if the latter are established there is the need to devise means support their long-term maintenance (AFSI 2016).Biological and social harvest assessments can also provide information to develop potential incentive schemes to reduce hunting, where appropriate, through promoting economic alternatives or identifying substitute food sources (AFSI 2016).",Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Accordingly, it is classified as Extinct. Endemic to Maui, H. affinis was confined to the upper slopes of Haleakala. The last specimens were taken in 1896 by Perkins (in Banko 1984). Although Pratt and Pyle (2000) express some scepticism of the 20th century records, the USFWS (2023) consider the last genuine record to be in 1996 (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). Recent searches and extensive surveys for other species on Maui, have failed to locate it. It was driven to extinction by habitat loss and degradation, introduced rats, cats, pigs and other non-natives, and in particular as a result of avian malaria and avian pox viruses from introduced mosquitoes.","Hemignathus affinis inhabited dense, wet 'ohi'a forest and the higher parts of mesic koa-'ohi'a forest (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987). All recent reported sightings were between 1,450 and 2,000 m, mostly at the lower end of that range (Scott et al. 1986) although the most recent 1996 record was at 1,890 m. Foraging habits were similar to H. hanapepe in that it fed on wood-borers, spiders and beetles (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987, Conant et al. 1998, Reynolds et al. 1995). It hunted along the upper and lower surfaces of branches, both up and down the trunks (Perkins 1903) probing the bark on living and dead trees. It also gleaned caterpillars from the leaves of low trees (Munro 1960). According to Munro (1960), when feeding it would insert its longer, decurved, upper mandible into crevices and holes to hook out arthropods and then catch them with its tongue and lower mandible.","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778, 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009). With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species. Hawai’i has a long history of non-native species. The arrival of Polynesians brought pigs Sus scrofa, dogs Canis familiaris and Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans. With Europeans and Americans came Black R. rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, cats Felis catus, mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, feral goats Capra hircus, cattle Bos taurus, deer Axis axis, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have severely damaged forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for H. affinis and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009). Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. Maui still retains some forest above 1,500 m, offering some refugia from these fatal diseases. However, the quality and intactness of this forest is less than pristine. Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009). As the climate warms the elevational limits of Culex will shift upslope and the area of suitable, mosquito-free forest will shrink even more (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009).The extinction of other Maui species such as Maui-nui Akialoa Akialoa lanaiensis, that occupied somewhat similar niches to H. affinis, suggest the threats posed by avian diseases, habitat loss and non-native species on Maui are severe enough to drive the species to extinction.","After no sightings for more than 60 years, Hemignathus affinis was rediscovered in 1967 (Banko 1968). There were then almost 30 subsequent claimed reports (with the last being made in 1996: Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001), however most, if not all, of these observations are thought to be misidentifications of Chlorodrepanis virens and possibly Pseudonestor xanthophrys (Pratt and Pyle 2000). However, a number of records have been by highly qualified observers and the last confirmed sighting is considered to be the 1996 record from Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001, USFWS 2023). There have however been no claims made since and the species is widely considered extinct by multiple sources. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.91, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.94. It is accordingly considered Extinct. In addition to the extinction probability assessment made here, the USFWS (2023) delisted H. affinis from the Federal Lists of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants due to presumed extinction.","","Hemignathus affinis was endemic to Maui in the Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A. It was found on the eastern and north-eastern slopes of Haleakala, in Hosmer's Grove and Waikamoi Preserve and from the Hanawi drainage east to Kipahulu Valley (Pratt and Pyle 2000). There have been no other confirmed sightings since 1996 despite extensive effort in a large proportion of the historic range, including annual surveys by the National Park Service (NPS), two State sanctioned surveys, monthly surveys in Hanawi, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) surveys and efforts by the Maui Forest Bird Recovery team. Although not all of these programmes surveyed locations where the species was last observed, many surveyed highly likely locations (Pratt and Pyle 2000, R. Camp in litt. 2003).","Historically Hawaiian honeycreepers were used extensively by indigenous people both for food and feathers (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Feathers were used to manufacture numerous cultural artefacts such as mahiole (feathered helmets), 'ahu'ula (feathered capes), malo (loin cloths) and 'aumakua hulu manu (icons of royal battle gods) (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). Primarily, the red feathers of Iiwi Drepanis coccinea and the black and yellow feathers of Oo Moho spp. and Hawaii Mamo D. pacifica were used for these purposes. Despite its yellow feathers, there is no direct evidence to suggest that H. affinis was used to manufacture feathered objects, although it is plausible. Likewise, they plausibly may have been taken for food as other honeycreepers were (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009). The use of Hawaiian honeycreepers for food and cultural artefacts has not occurred for a number of centuries (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009).",Terrestrial,"",Oceanian,1996,false,false,Global

The population trend is stable, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is considered to be large and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","It nests in burrows or under rock cavities and occasionally between tree buttresses from sea level to 900 m, but mostly between 500 and 800 m (Bester et al. 2002, Bester 2003). On Lord Howe, it breeds in forest, as once did the population of Norfolk Island, so the Phillip Island population is atypical, with burrows being in eroded cliffs of soft volcanic tuff (Priddel et al. 2010). It is a winter breeder, with birds from Phillip Island breeding at the same time as Lord Howe Island (Priddel et al. 2010). Adults arrive at Phillip from mid-April, a single egg is laid mid- to late May, hatching starts mid-July, and chicks are near-fledged by early November (Bester et al. 2007, Priddel et al. 2010). Adults land during daylight, often about 15.30 h (Priddel et al. 2010). A study on Lord Howe Island in 2000-2001 determined 54% breeding success in burrows visited twice and contents not handled, with 34-36% success in burrows repeatedly visited (Bester et al. 2007). Nests closest to burrow entrances had lowest breeding success, with the main causes of failure being flooding and predation of eggs and chicks by the endemic, threatened Lord Howe Woodhen Hypotaenidia sylvestris (Bester et al. 2007). A study in 2008 on Lord Howe Island found the breeding success in a small lowlands population to be three times higher (58%; n = 104) than in populations on Mount Gower (15%; n = 33) (D. Binder unpublished data). Additionally, adult provisioning trips were between 2–12 days (mean 4.8), with no evidence of a bimodal distribution of long and short trips (Binder et al. 2013). The adults feed predominantly on squid and fish with crustaceans less important. The most important prey item is bioluminescent fish from the genus Electrona; maximum diving depths have been recorded at 5 m (Bester 2003). It also scavenges for food taking fish offal and has been recorded scavenging on a Shining Bronze-cuckoo Chalcites lucidus (Bester 2003). It only occasionally follows fishing boats (Kuroda 1955, Bester 2003), but some fishing material has been reported in their diet (Bester 2003).","There are currently no plausible threats to the population on Lord Howe Island. On Phillip Island, Wedge-tailed Shearwater Ardenna pacifica sometimes evict young Providence Petrels from burrows (Priddel et al. 2010), and Purple Swamphens Porphyio porphyrio probably take some individuals (Priddel et al. 2010). The petrels were extirpated from Norfolk Island in the early 1800s as a result of feral pig Sus scrofa predation and hunting (Medway 2002), with pigs probably preventing the species from successfully nesting below the mountain summits on Lord Howe Island (Hull 1909). Wild pigs, cats and goats have been successfully eradicated from Lord Howe Island. Providence Petrels appear to have been unaffected by Black rats Rattus rattus which proliferated on Lord Howe Island after introduction in 1918 (McCulloch 1921). If rat eradication does occur, introduced masked owls Tyto novaehollandiae may switch to preying on petrels, potentially causing problematic declines (Bester et al. 2007); for this reason it has been proposed to subsequently eradicate the species (Walsh et al. 2019). Currently, the main causes of nest failure in the southern mountains are inundation of burrows and predation of eggs and chicks by Lord Howe Woodhens Hypotaenidia sylvestris, but neither of these threats is significant (Bester et al. 2002). Eradication of pigs and cats Felis catus on Lord Howe in the 1980s (McAllan et al. 2004) enabled spread of the species, with birds breeding beyond the southern mountains (Lombal et al. 2017). The species is considered to be of medium risk from longline fishing in the western and central Pacific (Waugh et al. 2012), but there is no direct evidence of capture or empirical evidence of population decline. Hunting is known to have severely affected the Norfolk Island population in the past, possibly causing its extirpation (Medway 2002), but is thought to be unlikely to return. Plastic ingestion may also represent a threat, with plastic found in the stomachs of over 10% of the birds sampled (Bester et al. 2010), however, this is not known to have any adverse consequences. Climate change may pose a future threat to the species (Rodríguez et al. 2019).","More than 99% of the global population now breeds on Lord Howe Island, where approximately 32,000 pairs nest on Mt Gower and Mt Lidgbird with some additional birds nesting on the lower slopes and Northern Hills (Bester 2003). A small but increasing (c.250 pairs in 2016) population now breeds on Phillip Island after their discovery in the 1980s (Hermes et al. 1986, Carlile et al. 2021). Overall, the contemporary population is estimated to number 66,500-100,000 mature individuals, with a best estimate, from Carlile et al. (2021), of 83,000. Historically, a population on Norfolk Island was thought to have numbered about a million pairs in the late 18th century (Medway 2002) and was probably even larger 600 years earlier, before the arrival of Polynesian settlers (Lombal et al. 2017).",Stable,"More than 99% of the global population of Providence Petrels breed on Lord Howe Island in the Tasman Sea, Australia, having been extirpated from the Norfolk Island group in the early 1800s (Medway 2002). A small but increasing population (~250 pairs in 2016) now breeds on Phillip Island in the Norfolk Island group after their discovery in the 1980s (Hermes et al. 1986). Birds are present at both breeding islands from March to November annually and often forage off eastern Australia (Bester et al. 2002, N. Carlile and T. O'Dwyer unpublished, in Carlile et al. 2021). Its non-breeding distribution is across the western Tasman Sea with some dispersing to the north and northwest Pacific Ocean, perhaps as far north as the Bering Sea (Marchant and Higgins 1990, Carlile et al. 2021).","Hunting is known to have severely affected the Norfolk Island population in the past, possibly causing its extirpation (Medway 2002), but is thought to be unlikely to return.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe Lord Howe Island group was designated a World Heritage Site in 1982. Control of rats has been an ongoing process on Lord Howe. An initial eradication was locally successful (see Bester et al. 2007) and a widespread $16 m eradication programme began in winter 2019. Although initially thought to be successful, two rats were detected and killed in 2021, although these were suspected to be incursions from the mainland rather than survivors of the eradication (Lord How Island Board in litt. 2021).   In 2006, a proposal was submitted to eradicate all mammalian predators from all, or at least a significant part, of Norfolk Island (Holdaway 1999). Such measures might involve the establishment of an exclosure in the National Park in which all mammals are eliminated, and where chicks are translocated (Holdaway 1999, S. Garnett in litt. 2006). The small colony on Phillip Island is surveyed irregularly and monitoring of the main Lord Howe island population has occurred as part of research projects (Carlile et al. 2021).Conservation Actions ProposedCensus the Lord Howe Island population at least once every five years, and the Phillip Island population every three years. Monitor breeding success on a 1-3 year basis. Eradicate cats and rat species from Norfolk Island (Holdaway 1999), or at least establish an exclusion area (Holdaway 1999, S. Garnett in litt. 2006).

The Autumn migration is started by the non-breeding birds in late-June, the breeding birds following from late-July to September (Olsen and Larsson 2003). The return migration takes place between February and late-June, with the species arriving at breeding colonies from March onwards, and breeding from May or late-April to mid-June (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It breeds colonially, often with other gull species (especially Herring Gull Larus argentatus), in colonies ranging in size from a few pairs to several tens of thousands (Richards 1990, Snow and Perrins 1998, Mitchell et al. 2004). Outside of the breeding season the species remains gregarious, normally migrating singly or in small groups of less than 10, and often feeding in flocks of hundreds of individuals on rubbish dumps or over shoals of fish at sea (Urban et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998). It may also feed singly or in small groups (Urban et al. 1986). In its African wintering grounds the species may roost communally during the day on salt or fresh waterbodies (Urban et al. 1986, Bustnes et al. 2006). Habitat Breeding The species breeds in colonies, showing a preference for level-ground that is well covered with fairly close, short vegetation, often nesting under heather, bracken or other vegetation (sometimes under pine trees) (Richards 1990, Hume and Pearson 1993, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Mitchell et al. 2004). Suitable sites include flat, unbroken grassy slopes, sand-dunes,the tops and ledges of coastal cliffs, rocky offshore islands, saltmarshes, the margins of inland lakes, islands in lakes and rivers, and high moorland, although the species will also nest on buildings and rooftops (Richards 1990, Olsen and Larsson 2003, Mitchell et al. 2004).. Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species chiefly inhabits inshore and offshore seas, as well as lagoons, estuaries, harbours and seashores in the tropics (Snow and Perrins 1998). It may also frequent inland habitats during this season, such as large lakes and rivers, in England preferring flooded gravel pits and reservoirs, canals, river weirs, flood-lands and sewage treatment areas ((Urban et al. 1986, Snow and Perrins 1998). As in the breeding season it is often seen foraging on arable land, pasture land, and on refuse dumps (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet The species is an omnivorous, opportunistic feeder that forages extensively at sea. Its diet consists of small fish (especially Baltic herring Clupea harengus), aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates (e.g. beetles, flies and larvae, ants, moths, grasshoppers, crustaceans, molluscs, segmented worms and starfish), bird eggs and nestlings, carrion, offal, rodents, berries and grain (Urban et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, BirdLife International 2000, Olsen and Larsson 2003). It often follows fishing fleets, feeding on discarded bycatch (BirdLife International 2000). Breeding site The nest can be anything between a heap of grass, seaweed, lichen, feathers (or other local materials), and a simple sparsely-lined scrape, that is usually positioned on open ground on a flat rock or a bare peat hag (Richards 1990, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Mitchell et al. 2004).","Declines in the most northerly breeding subspecies L. f. fuscus have been attributed in part to the high level of DDE residues accumulated during the non-breeding season, when this subspecies is found further south than the rest of the species (Bustnes 2006, Burger et al. 2018). High levels of PCBs have also been recorded with the potential to lead to mortality in chicks (Hario et al. 2000). Lesser Black-backed Gulls are also persecuted in some areas of its range, which may lead to displacement or even local declines.","The global population is estimated at 940,000-2,070,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2015).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory, travelling in stages via several stop-over sites between separate breeding and wintering grounds (Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992). The species breeds from late-May or early-June in single pairs or loose groups, with moulting non-breeders and failed breeders gathering on areas of open water separate from the major breeding congregations (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005). After breeding the species gathers in small flocks (less than 30 individuals) to undergo a post-breeding moult period near the breeding grounds where it becomes flightless for c.25 days (Madge and Burn 1988, Scott and Rose 1996). After this moulting period flocks gather to migrate south to winter quarters, leaving the breeding areas from late-August through September and arriving late in the autumn (Madge and Burn 1988). Outside of the breeding season the species is highly gregarious (large flocks of up to 30,000 individuals are recorded in Europe), although it is more commonly observed in small loose groups due to the patchiness of its favoured habitat (Madge and Burn 1988, Kear 2005). The species usually forages within 20 km of rooting sites, although the optimum distance for foraging areas may be less than this (less than 4 km in Scotland, UK) (Vickery and Gill 1999, Kear 2005). Habitat Breeding The species breeds in open, low-lying, shrubby tundra on the coast and inland, in close proximity to marshes, lakes, pools, rivers, and willow- and shrub-lined ponds and streams (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). It requires dry slopes, banks, mounds, hummocks or patches of sand or clay for nesting sites, especially those commanding good views of the surrounding area (Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding The species winters in open country on steppe and agricultural land (e.g. improved grassland, stubble fields and wet meadows), or in brackish and freshwater marshy habitats (such as upland bogs, peatlands and floodlands) (Johnsgard 1978, Madge and Burn 1988, del Hoyo et al. 1992, Scott and Rose 1996, Kear 2005). It may also roost on tidal marshes, in sheltered bays or in estuaries and frequents inland lakes and reservoirs in North America (Kear 2005). Diet The species is herbivorous, its diet consisting of the roots, leaves, stems, seeds and fruits of terrestrial plants such as herbs, grasses and sedges, as well as agricultural grain (e.g. corn, oats, wheat, rice and barley), potatoes and sprouting cereals (especially in the winter) (Johnsgard 1978, del Hoyo et al. 1992). Breeding site The nest is a shallow construction of plant matter on the ground amongst vegetation such as grass or dwarf scrub heath, often on raised hummocks or slopes to reduce the risk of flooding and provide a vantage point of the surrounding area (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005).","The species is threatened by intense hunting pressure resulting in mortality and disturbance at staging and moulting sites (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005, Glahder and Walsh 2006, Nikolaeva et al. 2006). The species is sustainably hunted for sport in Denmark (Bregnballe et al. 2006). It is also susceptible to poisoning by pesticides used on agricultural land (Kwon et al. 2004). Populations in Greenland are threatened by human disturbance at moulting sites from tourists in cruise liners (once displaced from a site birds are unlikely to find unoccupied replacement sites) (Glahder and Walsh 2006), and the species is susceptible to avian influenza so may be threatened by future outbreaks of the vius (Melville and Shortridge 2006). Climatic changes are likely to cause range contractions in this species' already highly restricted breeding range, and are already causing other species (e.g. Canada Geese Branta canadensis) to move northward, increasing competition for resources (Kear 2005, Fox et al. 2006). Oil exploration in the tundra habitat poses a threat to the species' breeding and moulting sites by increasing the possibility of oil spills and chronic oil pollution, by direct habitat destruction (influencing breeding site selection and reducing reproductive success) and through human disturbance (Kear 2005, Glahder and Walsh 2006, Grishanov 2006, Nikolaeva et al. 2006). Wetland habitat degradation due to drainage, peat-extraction and changing management practices (decreased grazing and mowing in meadows leading to scrub over-growth) is also a problem in areas of Russia (Grishanov 2006).","The European breeding population is estimated at 280,000-331,000 pairs, which equates to 560,000-662,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2021). Across its North American range, newer information suggests that the species numbers 4,300,000 mature individuals, where conversions have already taken place to estimate the number of breeding adults (Partners in Flight 2021). In East Asia, the population across South Korea, Japan and China are thought to number 231,000-283,000 individuals (Jia et al. 2016), roughly converted to 154,000-189,000 mature individuals. To account for additional population structures across the species' flyways (per Wetlands International 2022), a revised global population estimate is therefore placed in the band of 5,000,000-5,999,999 mature individuals.",Unknown,"","The species is threatened by intense hunting pressure resulting in mortality and disturbance at staging and moulting sites (del Hoyo et al. 1992, Kear 2005, Glahder and Walsh 2006, Nikolaeva et al. 2006).

It therefore is assessed as Vulnerable.","It feeds over coastal and interior forest and grassland (and formerly mangroves), capturing small insects in flight, preferring forest on Guam and Aguijan (G. Wiles unpublished data). A study in Aguiguan found Hymenoptera to be the most commonly consumed invertebrates (Valdez et al. 2011). It breeds and roosts in colonies in caves that typically hold a few to 700 birds (G. Wiles unpublished data). Nesting occurs year-round, but is greatest from late January to September or October. One egg is laid per clutch and pairs probably lay more than one clutch per year (G. Wiles unpublished data).","The cause of the decline on Guam and the extinction on Rota may relate to loss of insect prey through pesticide-use (Kohley et al. 2006, Johnson et al. 2018). Threats to this species including human disturbance of caves, predation by the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), loss and degradation of foraging habitat and nest loss due to introduced insects are all ongoing (USFWS 2020). Currently, predation by Boiga irregularis is the primary limiting factor on Guam and interactions with introduced mud dauber wasps Vespula sp. may interfere with recovery (the additional weight of wasps nests causes swiftlet nests to fall from cave walls). On Saipan, exotic cockroaches (which damage and destroy nests by consuming nest material and swiftlet saliva gluing them to cave walls) and possible disturbance by humans and feral mammals are the main threats (Wiles and Woodside 1999, G. Wiles unpubl. data).","Population size estimates for this species vary substantially depending on the method used. On Saipan, Radley (2009) estimated 6,111 birds in 10 caves in April 2009 but 4,891 swiftlets at eight caves in April 2013 (Radley 2013). Most recently, in 2016, 3,817 birds were counted in nine colonies (Liske-Clark et al. 2017a). On Aguiguan, the species has declined from the 1980s and the population was, in August 2016, estimated to number at least 338 birds across three colonies (Liske-Clark et al. 2017b) however at least four caves previously occupied by the species could not be surveyed due to inclement weather (Liske-Clark et al. 2017b, Johnson et al. 2018). On Guam, surveys at Mahlac Cave (the stronghold) between November 2010 and March 2016 yielded a mean population estimate of 1,145 (887-1,418) and 1,252 individuals were counted there in March 2016 (Johnson et al. 2018); in total, 1,549 birds were counted across three colonies in 2016 (Liske-Clark et al. 2017b) but were thought to have dropped to c.1,000 in 2020 (USFWS 2020). Populations on Rota and Tinian are considered extinct (Johnson et al. 2018). A smaller population, comprising 142 birds in a single tunnel, was introduced to O'ahu in the 1960s (Johnson et al. 2018).Excluding the O'ahu population, the best global estimate available, made in 2016, is that there are least 5,700 birds in the Mariana Islands (Johnson et al. 2018), corrected here to c.5,200 to account for the apparent reduction in the Guam population. This is thought to be equivalent to c.3,400 mature individuals. There remains a likelihood that additional populations will be discovered (Johnson et al. 2018, USFWS 2020), however these undiscovered colonies are unlikely to host large numbers of birds. Consequently, the population size is placed in the band 3,000-5,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Guam (to USA) and the Northern Mariana Islands (to USA), and was introduced to Oahu, Hawaiian Islands (USA) in the early 1960s.","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayOn Guam, snakes have been trapped at the main colony, at ports of entry and military areas. Acetaminophen has been used to control snakes within a 55-hectare fenced area on the Anderson Air Force Base (AAFB) on Guam (USFWS 2015). Colonies have been censused regularly, nesting has been observed and foraging ranges mapped. On Rota, surveys have been conducted confirming that there is now sufficient insect prey to allow successful reintroduction. On Saipan and Aguijan, colonies have been censused periodically and insecticide applied to kill cockroaches (G. Wiles in litt. 2000). Rat control on Oahu has resumed but is being done less often than previously because access to the site has become more difficult (E. VanderWerf in litt. 2012). The Pacific Islands Climate Change Cooperative (PICCC) has funded research that will increase the spatial resolution in which climate change predictions can be made for this species (USFWS 2015).Conservation Actions ProposedUse acoustic monitoring to find potential new colonies (USFWS 2020).

It is therefore listed as Near Threatened.","It can be expected on virtually any body of water, including estuaries, marshes and golf course wetlands (M. Reed in litt. 2007). It is typically a species of the coastal plain, usually found below 400 m, however some birds inhabit upland pools above 1,500 m on Kaua'i and montane stock ponds up to 2,000 m on Hawai'i (USFWS 2005). Breeding sites are characterised by robust emergent plants interspersed with open, fresh or brackish water, which is usually less than one metre deep. To some extent it is nomadic and irruptive, wandering between islands in response to the availability of water-bodies (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). It may nest in any month of the year (USFWS 2005).","Ongoing threats to this species include predation, degradation of wetlands, and avian disease (USFWS 2021). Throughout its range, wetlands have been destroyed by drainage for cultivation and developments (Berger 1972, P. Donaldson in litt. 1999, S. L. Pimm in litt. 1999) such as hotels, housing areas, golf courses, shopping centres, landfill sites, military installations, roads and industrial sites (USFWS 2005). Some water-bodies have become overgrown by introduced plants (H. C. Baker and P. E. Baker in litt. 1999, M. Morin in litt. 1999). On O'ahu, artificial wetlands associated with sugarcane plantations have disappeared as these industries have declined on the island (P. Donaldson in litt. 1999). Wetlands continue to be threatened with urban development and invasive plant species, though surveys suggest the population size overall has not been affected detrimentally (Paxton et al. 2021). Introduced predators include the Black Rat Rattus rattus, Brown Rat Rattus norwegicus, domestic cat Felis catus and dog Canis familiaris, Small Indian Mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus and Cattle Egret Bubulcus ibis (Engilis and Pratt 1993, H. C. Baker and P. E. Baker in litt. 1999, M. Reed in litt. 2007). H. auropunctatus is known to take the eggs, young birds and nesting adults of wetland bird species (USFWS 2005). Predation appears to be a serious problem on golf courses, where F. alai is abundant (M. Reed in litt. 2007). The species may be poisoned by insecticides and herbicides used to treat water channels on agricultural land and golf courses (Berger 1972, P. Donaldson in litt. 1999), although research is required to confirm this potential threat and its severity. Outbreaks of avian botulism have caused high mortality in several areas (Morin 1996, H. C. Baker and P. E. Baker in litt. 1999, M. Morin in litt. 1999, E. VanderWerf in litt. 2007), a threat that may increase with climate change, increasing urbanisation and invasive aquatic species (USFWS 2021). Changes in precipitation due to climate change, as well as threats of flooding and saltwater intrusion, are thought to be causing degradation of wetland habitat (Timm et al. 2015).","The population is thought to vary year-to-year in response to rainfall, with periodic fluctuations to below 1,500 mature individuals. The most recent minimum population estimate is 1,815 (1,248– 2,577) individuals, based on a 5-year average (2012–2016) of biannual waterbird census counts (Paxton et al. 2021). Assuming that summer counts reflect the best metric of mature individuals, the population size is here estimated at 1,250-1,750 mature individuals (based on Figure 1 in van Rees et al.

Historical and occasional recent sightings in dry mamane forest suggest that some individuals may move seasonally, or that a very small population may inhabit dry forest year-round (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger 1995-1996). It nests in koa trees as well as in tall ‘ōhi‘a trees, and the species has successfully bred in disturbed woodland (VanderWerf 1998). It forages for insects, spiders, and other invertebrates on large or medium-size branches, mostly on koa and  ‘ōhi‘a, but also on pilo (Coprosma spp.), ‘ōlapa (Cheirodendron trigynum), naio, and kāwa‘u (Ilex anomala). The nesting season is from February-June (VanderWerf 1998, Woodworth et al. 2001). Most nests are open cups, but about 15 percent are placed in cavities or in bark crevices. The female builds the nest, incubates eggs, and broods nestlings. The male delivers food to the female on and off the nest. Both parents feed the young for approximately one month after fledging. They re-nest after failures and pairs have been documented raising two broods in a season. Nest success of the species is low (VanderWerf 1998), but adults have high annual survival (Woodworth et al. 2001). During the breeding season the species’ home range averages 4-7 hectares (10-17 acres) in size and a 10-20 meter (33-66 feet) territory around the nest is defended (VanderWerf 1998). Outside the breeding season, Hawai’i Creepers frequently join mixed-species foraging flocks (Hart and Freed 2003) and forage over home ranges that average 11 hectares (VanderWerf 1998).","The primary threat to this species is introduced avian disease to which it is highly susceptible, particularly avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum), causing it to have a limited distribution at higher elevations (Atkinson et al. 1995; Atkinson et al. 2000; Banko and Banko 2009). Climate change is projected to cause an increase in the elevation below which regular transmission of avian malaria occurs, reducing the area of suitable habitat and exacerbating declines (USFWS 2020). According to climate projections, due to increased rainfall and temperatures, high elevation areas for Hawaiian bird populations will only remain free of mosquitos to mid-century (Liao et al. 2015) and GIS simulation has shown that a 2 degrees Celsius increase would cause a c.100% decline in the land area where transmission is currently only periodic (Benning et al. 2002). Avian poxvirus is an additional threat, also transmitted by the non-native southern house mosquito (Culex quinquefasciatus) (VanderWerf 2012). The species may have declined in the past owing to habitat loss and degradation (Ralph and Fancy 1994, VanderWerf 1998), although its ability to breed in some types of disturbed forest suggests that habitat alteration is not the primary factor limiting its current distribution (VanderWerf 1998). Feral ungulates, particularly pigs, have severely degraded native forests and facilitate the spread of alien plants and disease-carrying mosquitoes (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt 1994). Nest-predation by introduced rodents and nest-site limitation are additional threats (Ralph and Fancy 1994, VanderWerf 1998). Birds are also negatively affected by competition with Japanese White-eye Zosterops japonicus (Freed and Cann 2009), and chewing lice are thought to be an additional threat (Freed et al. 2008). In addition to exacerbating the threat of introduced diseases, climate change is predicted to increase the geographic extent and intensity of habitat loss, invasive plants and non-native predators (Paxton et al. 2018).","Surveys in 1976-1983 estimated the population at c.12,500 individuals (Scott et al. 1986). In 2009, the total population was estimated at c.14,000 birds (Gorresen et al. 2009), roughly equivalent to 9,300 mature individuals overall, with 9,888 birds (95% CI: 6,115-14,974) occurring in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (Kendall et al. 2022).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Hawai`i in the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.), where it was formerly widespread, but now occurs as four disjunct populations in windward Hawai‘i, Ka‘ū, Kona, and Hualālai (USFWS 2020).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThe Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge was established to protect some of the best remaining habitat for this and other threatened honeycreepers (Scott et al. 1986, Ralph and Fancy 1994). The species has become extinct in the montane sections of the Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park (T. Pratt in litt. 2007). However, in 2003, the Kahuku unit was added to the national park, incorporating much of the species' habitat in the Kau area (T. Pratt in litt. 2007). The fencing and eradication of feral goats began in the national park in 1971 (Stone and Loope 1987), and the removal of cattle, mouflon sheep and pigs from the Kahuku unit is expected to benefit the species (T. Pratt in litt. 2007). During the 1990s, efforts were made to reduce the feral pig population by Hawaiian conservation authorities and private landowners (Anderson and Stone 1993). Planting of koa and other native plants began in the early 1990s, and at the Kapapala Forest Reserve and the Pu`u Wa`awa`a Forest Bird Sanctuary, cattle have been removed and fences erected (USFWS 2006). The Zoological Society of San Diego is developing techniques for rearing birds from eggs and breeding them in captivity, including the Hawai`i Creeper, at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center (USFWS 2006). Development of genetic tools to reduce transmission of avian malaria is ongoing. This includes transgenic or genetically modified mosquitoes that have reduced ability to transmit pathogens and also incompatible insect techniques, for example using a different strain of Wolbachia bacteria to produce males that cannot produce viable offspring (USFWS 2020, Miranda Paez et al. 2022).Conservation Actions ProposedCarry out surveys to obtain an up-to-date estimate of the species' total population size.

On Hawai`i, it is an obligate cavity-nester and the highest densities are in old-growth forests, although it is also numerous in some disturbed forests with sufficient large trees. It feeds on small insects (including caterpillars) and spiders (Lepson and Freed 1997), and forages in the foliage of `ohi`a trees Metrosideros polymorpha (Freed et al. 2008b).

Avian poxvirus is an additional threat, also transmitted by the non-native southern house mosquito (Culex quinquefasciatus) (VanderWerf 2012). Its habitat has been destroyed by logging and agriculture, and by commensal animals which have invaded montane forests (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt 1994, Lepson and Freed 1997). The slow growth of `ohi`a trees suggests that the large trees used for nesting are very old and so may take a long time to replace (VanderWerf 2012). This species may be more vulnerable to habitat degradation as they are considered obligate cavity nesters (Freed 2001), although there is some evidence that nesting behaviour may vary between isolated populations (Judge et al. 2018). Research has demonstrated that structural changes to habitat have affected food availability for this species (Fretz 2002). Feral ungulates, particularly pigs, have severely degraded native forests and facilitate the spread of alien plants and disease-carrying mosquitoes (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt 1994). Introduced birds are reservoirs for diseases, and potential competitors for food (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt 1994, Lepson and Freed 1997). Birds are negatively affected by competition with Japanese White-eye Zosterops japonicus (Freed and Cann 2009), and chewing lice are thought to be an additional threat (Freed et al. 2008a). Introduced rats, cats, Barn Owls Tyto alba and possibly small Indian mongooses Herpestes auropunctatus are predators (Lepson and Freed 1997). An outbreak of introduced yellow-jacket wasps coincided with a year of poor reproductive success, and introduced ants probably also compete for native arthropods at lower elevations (Lepson and Freed 1997). In addition to exacerbating the threat of introduced diseases, climate change is predicted to increase the geographic extent and intensity of habitat loss, invasive plants and non-native predators (Paxton et al. 2018).","In 1977, the total population of Hawai‘i ‘ākepa was estimated 13,892 (95% CI + 1,825) birds (Scott et al. 1986). In 2016, total population was estimated 16,248 (95% CI 10,074 - 25,198) birds (Judge et al. 2018), roughly equivalent to 10,800 mature individuals overall, with 7,221 birds (95% CI: 4,164-11,173) occurring in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (Kendall et al. 2022).",Decreasing,"Loxops coccineus is endemic to the Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A., where it occurs as five disjunct populations in the north and central windward Hawai‘i, Ka‘ū, Kona, and Hualālai regions (USFWS 2020).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayOn Hawai`i, a large population is protected in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge and, to a lesser extent, in Ka`u Forest Reserve, Kulani Prison, Kilauea-Keauhou forests, Kona Forest National Wildlife Refuge and Pu`u Wa`awa`a State Wildlife Preserve (Lepson and Freed 1997, J.

It formerly occupied dry mamane and naio woodlands from 1,900 to 2,900 m on Mauna Kea (Ralph and Fancy 1996, L. Pejchar in litt. 2007). Research suggests that it occurs in high densities and forages and nests successfully in secondary growth koa in regenerating forests (T. Pratt in litt. 1999, Pejchar et al. 2005). The species is found at its highest densities in koa plantations and forests with a high percentage of koa trees (Pejchar et al. 2005). It is the only species on Hawai`i to exploit the woodpecker niche, but is rare despite the lack of competition (Ralph and Fancy 1996). It feeds primarily on lepidopteran and cerambicid larvae under the bark of koa trees, and it only occasionally feeds on nectar (Pejchar and Jeffrey 2004). Its preference for koa trees is evident despite the relative scarcity of this tree species in the environment (Pejchar et al. 2005). As an apparent alternative to nectar the species regularly feeds on sap from `ohi`a trees all year round, perhaps to supplement insect larvae, whose populations fluctuate. The species acquires sap by drilling 3-5 mm deep holes into the phloem of suitable trees and drinking the sap that emerges. The preferred trees (known as ""Aki trees"") are rare (2 ha-1), spatially clustered and defended by the species. Selected trees are probably used by successive generations (Pejchar and Jeffrey 2004). Pairs occupy very large home ranges (0.25-0.30 km2 [E. VanderWerf in litt. 1999]) and produce only one chick per year (T. Pratt in litt. 2007), which has a long dependency period (Ralph and Fancy 1996).","The primary threat to this species is introduced avian disease to which it is highly susceptible, particularly avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum), causing it to have a limited distribution at higher elevations (Atkinson et al. 1995, 2000; Banko and Banko 2009). Climate change is projected to cause an increase in the elevation below which regular transmission of avian malaria occurs, reducing the area of suitable habitat and exacerbating declines (USFWS 2020). According to climate projections, due to increased rainfall and temperatures, high elevation areas for Hawaiian bird populations will only remain free of mosquitos to mid-century (Liao et al. 2015) and GIS simulation has shown that a 2 degrees Celsius increase would cause a c.100% decline in the land area where transmission is currently only periodic (Benning et al. 2002). Avian poxvirus is an additional threat, also transmitted by the non-native southern house mosquito (Culex quinquefasciatus) (VanderWerf 2012). The species may have declined in the past owing to habitat loss and degradation through grazing and logging (Ralph and Fancy 1994, VanderWerf 1998), although may be less limited by habitat loss than other Hawaiian honeycreepers because it will forage in relatively young koa (Pejchar et al. 2005). Predation by introduced rats, feral cats and native raptors are additional threats (Ralph and Fancy 1996). Predators may have been the primary threat to the now extinct Mauna Kea population, while disease may be responsible for declines in protected areas (Fancy et al. 1996). Feral ungulates, particularly pigs, have severely degraded native forests and facilitate the spread of alien plants and disease-carrying mosquitoes (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt 1994). Chewing lice may be an additional threat (Freed et al. 2008). In addition to exacerbating the threat of introduced diseases, climate change is predicted to increase the geographic extent and intensity of habitat loss, invasive plants and non-native predators (Paxton et al. 2018). Due to its low reproductive rate this species may be particularly vulnerable to these threats and slow to recover (USFWS 2006).","In 1976-1979 and 1983, surveys estimated c.1,500 birds, with 900 in Hamakua, 500 in Ka`u, 50 on Mauna Kea, and 20 in central Kona (Scott et al. 1986). In 1990-1995, surveys estimated 1,163, with 1,105 in Hamakua, c.44 in Ka`u, fewer than 10 on Mauna Kea (and only a few males by 1999 [T. Pratt in litt. 1999]), and perhaps fewer than 10 in Kona (Fancy et al. 1996). The population on western Mauna Kea has since been extirpated (VanderWerf 2012). The species' population in Ka`u was estimated at 1,073 individuals (95% CI: 616-1,869) in 2005 (Gorresen et al. 2007). It should be noted that this higher population estimate in Ka`u does not represent a genuine population increase, but an improvement in survey methodology. Surveys conducted during 2003-2004 in the Kapapala Forest Reserve reported 35 individuals (including 14 families) in c. 650 ha of the reserve (Pratt et al. 2009). The population at the Kona Forest National Wildlife Refuge may also now be extirpated (Fancy et al. 1996, Camp et al. 2009). The global population was estimated at 1,900 birds in 2009 (Gorreson et al. 2009), roughly equivalent to 1,300 mature individuals overall, with 1,163 birds (95% CI: 507-2,401) occurring in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (Kendall et al. 2022).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Hawai`i in the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.), where it was formerly widespread but now occurs as two distinct subpopulations (USFWS 2020).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayPopulations occur within Ka`u Forest Reserve, the Keauhou Ranch, Olaa/Kilauea partnership area, Kapapala Forest Reserve, Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (Fancy et al. 1996, J.

Habitat restoration work is underway for this species (S. Fretz, E. Vanderwerf, R. Camp, M. Gorresen and B. Woodworth in litt. 2003). Removal of cattle and fencing of the Kapapala Forest Reserve and the Pu`u Wa`awa`a Forest Bird Sanctuary has occurred; although the species does not occur in the latter reserve, it could serve as a site for reintroduction (USFWS 2006). The removal of cattle, mouflon sheep and pigs from the Kahuku Unit of the national park is expected to benefit the species (T. Pratt in litt. 2007). Extensive replanting of koa has occurred at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (~ 4,000 ha) and on Keauhou Ranch (Pejchar et al. 2005, L. Pejchar in litt. 2007, T. Pratt in litt. 2007). Both sites have been fenced and ungulates have been removed from significant portions of each site (L. Pejchar in litt. 2007).

It is therefore assessed as Vulnerable.","It inhabits wetlands, including coastal ponds, lakes, swamps, flooded grasslands, mountain streams, anthropogenic water-bodies and occasionally boggy forests (Todd 1996, T. C. Telfer in litt. 1999). Breeding occurs year-round, with the peak nesting season between September and May (Malachowski et al. 2019). It is an opportunistic feeder, taking invertebrates, seeds and plant matter (USFWS 2005). ","A significant population decline in the early 20th century was brought about by nest predation by rats, mongooses, domestic dogs and cats, introduced fish and birds, habitat loss for agriculture and urban development, and local hunting pressure (USFWS 2011). The indiscriminate hunting of migratory waterbirds in the late 1800s and early 1900s took a heavy toll on the species' population (USFWS 2011). Consequently, the species was extirpated from all Hawaiian islands except Kaua'i and Ni'ihau by 1962 (Swedberg 1967). Hybridisation with feral A. platyrhynchos, and therefore the danger of genetic introgression, has been a major threat to the species' recovery (USFWS 2011) such that despite subsequent translocations, only individuals on Kaua'i and Ni'ihau can be considered pure (Wells et al. 2019, Malachowski 2020). A. platyrhynchos was first imported to Hawaii in the late 1800s for ornamental ponds and farming, and in the 1950s and 1960s, hundreds were imported to stock hunting areas (Uyehara et al. 2007). Although Mallards are present on Kaua'i, there is little evidence of hybridisation within the past decade and conspecific mates remain abundant (Wells et al. 2019). As such, the number of hybrids is not thought to be increasing. The primary cause of adult mortality is thought to be avian botulism, which occurs year-round (Malachowski 2020). Introduced mammalian predators are an additional threat to the species, primarily cats and dogs but potentially rats also (Malachowski 2020). Avian predators such as Tyto alba and Asio flammeus may also pose a threat to the species (Malachowski 2020). Mongoose predation could be occurring at low levels given that sightings continue to be reported on Kaua'i, although they may not be well established (USFWS 2011). Additional threats include altered hydrology, such as flood control and channelisation, and non-native invasive plants which are causing ongoing habitat degradation (USFWS 2011, Malachowski 2020). Pigs, goats and other feral ungulates may degrade nesting habitat (USFWS 2011). The species is also threatened by drought and human disturbance from recreation and tourism (K. Uyehara, A. Marshall and A. Engilis Jr in litt. 2007). Sea level rise and increase groundwater salinity as a result of climate change may result in wetland habitat loss and degradation (USFWS 2011).","Recent research on the population genetics and movement ecology of the species indicates that only individuals on Kaua'i and Ni'ihau can be considered pure (Wells et al. 2019, Malachowski 2020). Engilis and Pratt (1993) estimated the population to number approximately 2,000 birds on Kaua'i. However, based on bi-annual surveys on Kaua'i, the 5 year average (2012-2016) population size was estimated to be 947 birds in total (751-1,185) (Paxton et al. 2021), roughly equivalent to 600 mature individuals. Survey data are considered minimum counts due to variation in detectability and the fact that montane streams commonly used by the species were not included, and additionally, Ni'ihau was not included in this analysis due to being inconsistently surveyed. The total number of mature individuals is therefore precautionarily placed in the range 700-999.",Increasing,"Anas wyvilliana was once an inhabitant of all the main Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.) except Lana'i and Kaho'olawe (USFWS 2005), but is now restricted to Kaua'i and Ni'ihau (Wells et al. 2019, Malachowski 2020).","The species was a popular game bird until hunting was prohibited in 1939, and hunting contributed to population declines (VanderWerf 2012).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayOn Kaua'i, the Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge is an important area for the species, especially in winter (Todd 1996). The species was reintroduced to O'ahu through the release of 326 captive-bred birds between 1958 and 1982 (USFWS 2005); in 1989, fewer than 12 captive-bred birds were released on Maui; and between 1976 and 1982, the species was reestablished on the Big Island also through the release of captive-bred birds (USFWS 2005). However, recent research on the population genetics and movement ecology of the species indicates that only individuals on Kaua'i and Ni'ihau can now be considered pure owing to extensive hybridisation with A. platyrhynchos (Wells et al. 2019, Malachowski 2020). In the late 1980s, the importation of A. platyrhynchos was restricted by the state, with exceptions only for research and exhibition (Uyehara et al. 2007). Efforts are ongoing to develop a key to distinguish between hybrids and pure individuals (USFWS 2021). In 2002, the department of agriculture placed an embargo on all birds shipped to the Hawaiian Islands, to protect the public from West Nile Virus. Predator control and habitat restoration is ongoing on Kaua'i (VanderWerf 2012).

Annual transect surveys indicate that the species is declining at a rate exceeding 50% in three generations, driven primarily by prolonged drought and habitat degradation by introduced ungulates and invasive plants. The species is restricted to a single location where all individuals present are highly vulnerable to fire. It is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered.","It is confined to altitudes of c. 2,000-3,000 m, favouring dry māmane and māmane-naio forest. It feeds primarily on māmane seeds, flowers, and insects (Banko et al. 2002, Banko and Farmer 2014, Hess et al. 2014), with the availability of māmane seeds affecting productivity and adult survival. The species is morphologically and behaviourally adapted to feeding on māmane seeds, grasping pods with its feet and using its stout bill to tear them open. In drought years, most birds do not attempt to breed (Jacobi et al. 1996, Pratt et al. 1997). The species exhibits low rates of reproduction (Banko et al. 2002, Banko and Farmer 2012), laying fewer eggs and taking longer to raise its young compared with mainland songbirds (Hess and Banko 2006).","The most significant declines in this species' range and population are thought to have been caused by human-induced habitat loss and degradation and impacts from feral and domestic ungulates (Banko et al. 2002, Banko and Farmer 2014, Banko et al. 2014b). Māmane forest is slow to recover and young māmane requires about 25 years of growth before the species frequent them for foraging and nesting (P. Banko in litt. 2023). The subalpine forest habitat of this species has been severely overbrowsed by sheep, mouflon sheep, goats, cattle, and its nests and adults are preyed upon primarily by feral cats Felis catus, but also by introduced Black Rats Rattus rattus, Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus, and rarely Hawaiian Hawk Buteo solitarius (Banko et al. 2002, Banko and Farmer 2014). Up to 11% of nests are depredated by feral cats each year (Hess and Banko 2006). Grazing by cattle was a historical factor in the species' decline, although cattle are now limited to pastures that are unsuitable for L. bailleui (C. Farmer in litt. 2007, Banko et al. 2014b). Continuing threats include grazing by feral sheep, wild sheep Ovis gmelini, and their hybrids, which slows māmane regeneration (Pratt et al. 1997, Banko and Farmer 2012, Banko et al. 2013, Banko et al. 2014b), and alien insects preying on and parasitising native insects (Pratt et al. 1997, Banko and Farmer 2012), particularly at low elevations (Banko and Farmer 2012). Native caterpillars are an important source of protein for nestlings, and possibly breeding females; however, they are preyed upon by Yellow-jacket Wasps and several ant species, particularly Argentine Ants Linepithema humile, whilst parasitoid wasps kill the caterpillars by laying their eggs on or inside them (Banko and Farmer 2012). Damage of Myoporum sandwichense tress from Naio thrips Klambothrips myopori may lead to increased tree death and increased fire risk (USFWS 2020). Alien grass cover such as African Fountain Grass Cenchrus setaceus and Orchard Grass Dactylis glomerata is high in much of the species' range (Banko and Farmer 2014), suppressing māmane regeneration and increasing the threat of fire (Thaxton and Jacobi 2009). Alien shrubs and vines potentially displace māmane and other native plants; e.g., Cape Ivy Delairea odorata and Common Gorse Ulex europaeus (Banko et al. 2020). Root rot caused by the non-native fungus Armillaria mellea is also responsible for dieback occurring in māmane forests (Banko et al. 2014b). Increasing human activities, such as military training, further increase the chances of fire (Thaxton and Jacobi 2009). In 2006-2007, there were numerous fires on and near Mauna Kea, and fires in August and September 2010 affected c.560 ha of suitable habitat on the southern slope of the mountain (American Bird Conservancy 2010, Banko et al. 2014b). A fire in the species' core area could potentially affect &gt;90% of the population (C. Farmer in litt. 2016). The opening of trails for all-terrain vehicles in the Mauna Kea Forest Reserve is a concern (C. Farmer in litt. 2007), and may cause disturbance and habitat degradation. In addition to the aforementioned threats, this species' very restricted range means it could be extirpated by extreme events such as drought and storms (Banko and Farmer 2012), and drought has contributed to declines given its high dependence on the unripened māmane seeds (Lindsey et al. 1997, Banko et al. 2013). Drought conditions on Mauna Kea occurred during 74 percent of the months from 2000 to 2010, recorded in all but two months from 2006 to 2010 (Banko et al. 2013). This leads to reduced māmane seed production, increased tree death and increased fire risk (VanderWerf 2012, USFWS 2020). Further declines in breeding success are expected in line with drought induced by El Niño, conditions of which are present as of 2023 and expected to increase (P. Banko in litt. 2023). This species' low reproductive capacity means it is slow to recover from perturbations. Demographic patterns of māmane mortality are under investigation, as māmane may be under threat from pathogens (USFWS 2006, Banko et al. 2014b). Climate change poses a long-term future threat to the species, as drought frequency and intensity are expected to increase at higher elevations, further affecting vegetation structure and compositions, and reducing the habitat's carrying capacity (Benning et al. 2002, Giambelluca and Luke 2007, Banko et al. 2013). Given that this species occurs primarily at elevations where mosquitoes are absent, it is thought to be more limited by habitat availability than by avian disease (Kilpatrick 2006). However, avian malaria and avian pox have significantly affected other forest birds and are likely to prevent the species re-establishing in areas of its former range (Jacobi et al. 1996). Additionally, climate change is projected to cause an increase in the elevation below which regular transmission of avian malaria occurs, reducing the area of suitable habitat and exacerbating existing declines (USFWS 2020). According to climate projections, due to increased rainfall and temperatures, high elevation areas for Hawaiian bird populations will only remain free of mosquitos to mid-century (Liao et al. 2015) and GIS simulation has shown that a 2 degrees Celsius increase would cause a c.100% decline in the land area where transmission is currently only periodic (Benning et al. 2002). Palila are highly sensitive to the disease and if the transmission zone rises sufficiently it is entirely plausible that the entire species would be affected by malaria (C. Farmer in litt. 2016, 2023).","In 2021 the population was estimated at 452−940 individuals (point estimate of 678), with previous estimates of 1,030−1,899 individuals (point estimate of 1,432) in 2019, and 964−1,700 individuals (point estimate of 1,312) in 2020 (Genz et al. 2022). Although 2021 abundance estimates are approximately 50% of 2020 estimates, this is considered biologically unlikely and previous low estimates from annual surveys in 2000, 2010 and 2015 have been immediately followed by an increase in subsequent years (Genz et al. 2022). The five-year average (2017-2021) population size is 1,128 individuals, and based on an approximate estimate that 86% are mature individuals (C. Farmer in litt. 2016) this equates to 970 mature individuals. The population size is therefore tentatively placed in the range 800-1,200 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species is restricted to the island of Hawaii in the Hawaiian islands (U.S.A.), where it was abundant, although locally distributed, until the beginning of the 20th century; evidence from the fossil record suggests that the species occurred throughout the archipelago prior to human settlement (Olson and James 1982, Burney et al. 2001). In 1997, it occupied an estimated 78 km2 and numbered 4,396 individuals, mostly on the western slope of Mauna Kea, where 20.5 km2 was estimated to hold 72% of the total population (Scott et al. 1986, Fancy et al. 1997, Banko et al. 1998). The species' range remains centred on the western slope, and it has contracted such that c.96% of the population is found in 4,600 ha of forest (R. Camp in litt. 2014). It has not been found in annual surveys on the east slope since 2004 (P. Banko in litt. 2007, C. Farmer in litt. 2007, R. Camp in litt. 2014, 2016). A small colony of reintroduced individuals has been extirpated on the northern slope (Banko et al. 2014a).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayThe species' population has been monitored since 1980 (Scott et al. 1986, Leonard et al. 2008, Camp et al. 2016). Annual surveys are conducted to monitor range and abundance (USFWS 2020). In 1979, 1987 and 1998, federal courts ordered the eradication of feral goats and feral and wild sheep species from the species' habitat on Mauna Kea, and these rulings have remained in effect despite six legal challenges (Banko et al. 2009, 2014b). Forest regeneration has improved as a result, although current efforts to reduce sheep have not been sufficient to allow the complete recovery of māmane forests (Banko et al. 2014b). Palila have some site fidelity, but have also been detected moving around Mauna Kea into new forested areas (Banko and Farmer 2014). In 1993, some birds were translocated to a new site on the eastern slope where predators were controlled and, although many homed back to their capture site, at least two pairs stayed and bred successfully (Fancy et al. 1997). By the end of 2006, 188 wild birds had been translocated from the western to the northern slope of Mauna Kea (Banko and Farmer 2014). Approximately 34% persisted for longer than two months, and a small colony of up to c.23 birds remained on the northern slope and bred successfully until 2010. Although F2 generation offspring were observed, the colony was not sustainable without additional management (Banko et al. 2009, Banko and Farmer 2014) and it was extirpated by 2011 (P. Banko in litt. 2012). Egg-laying occurred in 2004, and independent juveniles were produced in every year from 2005-2010 (Banko and Farmer 2014). This translocation programme was aided by a captive breeding programme initiated at the Keauhou Bird Conservation Center in 1996 (USFWS 2006, Banko and Farmer 2014). Of 28 captive-reared birds released in 2003-2009, at least 10 persisted in the reintroduction area for at least one year, with 2 males successfully producing fledglings with translocated wild females in the north slope colony before its extirpation (Banko and Farmer 2014). Results suggest that, although some translocated birds nest successfully and others remain in the new area for over a year, eventually all birds return to the source area (western slope) (Banko et al. 2020). Eight captive birds were released at the Puʻu Mali Restoration Area on the north slope of Mauna Kea in 2019 (USFWS 2020). After being temporarily held in release aviaries, individuals dispersed widely but most died from predation or disappeared within one week (USFWS 2020). A captive population is  maintained by San Diego Zoo Global (USFWS 2020).The construction of a highway through unoccupied, federally designated critical habitat was approved in 1999. A mitigation plan accompanied the development, including the suspension of cattle grazing in pastures adjacent to the species' range on the northern and western slopes. The species' conservation was the subject of detailed research, and funding from the mitigation plan supported translocation research and enabled the expansion or continuation of studies into the species' ecology and limiting factors, māmane ecology, food availability, predator ecology and management, and fire ecology (Banko and Farmer 2014). The state of Hawaii continues habitat restoration and research into restoration methods (Banko and Farmer 2014). Work is being carried out to restore habitat by controlling African Fountain Grass Pennisetum setaceum, which increases the frequency and intensity of fires, and Cape Ivy Delairea odorata, which reduces the vigour of native trees (American Bird Conservancy 2010). In 2010, a comprehensive fire management plan was being developed for the Mauna Kea area (Thaxton and Jacobi 2009, American Bird Conservancy 2010). There are currently 100 km of fencing around critical habitat and around the Kaʻohe and Puʻu Mali restoration areas, as well as 26 km of fire breaks in place (USFWS 2020). The Mauna Kea Forest Restoration Project conducts weed control, forest restoration, forest monitoring, fence monitoring and maintenance, community outreach, volunteer trips, and ungulate control at Kaʻohe and Puʻu Mali Restoration Areas and in the core habitat within Mauna Kea Forest Reserve, and predator control is ongoing (USFWS 2020). Research is ongoing to determine survival rates, causes of nest failure, habitat use, dispersal, nest site characteristics, disease prevalence and predator prevalence (USFWS 2020). Conservation and Research Actions ProposedContinue population surveys and monitoring to determine response to management actions and the effects of climate change (USFWS 2020). Investigate methods to reduce or control invasive grass cover on Mauna Kea (USFWS 2020). Examine experimental approaches to restore Sophora chrysophylla in heavily degraded areas and improve tree vigor and density by applying fertilizer, giving water, and/or removing competing weeds in the less affected forest habitats (USFWS 2020). The restoration and protection of mamane in woodlands adjacent to its current range would allow the species to exploit increased food availability in areas of their former range (Hess et al. 2014). Reforest areas adjacent to the Mauna Kea Forest Reserve and areas where alien grasses and grazing threaten māmane (Pratt et al. 1997).  Continue to restore forest above Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (Benning et al. 2002), including expanding work on Kanakaleonui Bird Corridor. Expand control of invasive introduced plants (USFWS 2020). Remove and fence out ungulates from all critical habitat and the mitigation parcels (Banko et al. 2013, Banko and Farmer 2014, Banko et al. 2014b, USFWS 2020). Intensify control of mammalian predators (especially feral cats) and grazing ungulates (Pratt et al. 1997, H. Baker and P. Baker in litt. 1999, T. Pratt in litt. 1999, P. Banko in litt. 2007, Banko et al. 2013, Banko et al. 2014b, USFWS 2020). Enhance habitat outside the occupied range to aid establishment of new populations (USFWS 2020). Continue to expand the application of translocations and captive propagation for introducing the species to currently unoccupied sites within the former range (Pratt et al. 1997, C. Farmer in litt. 2007, Banko and Farmer 2014, USFWS 2020). Increase public support for Palila conservation and work to resolve conflicts between hunters and local governments. Implement fire risk reduction measures by establishing green fuel breaks and improving existing roadway fire breaks; improve fire detection and response by stationing fire response resources (such as water trucks and fire spotters) on the west slope of Mauna Kea in key habitat; and conduct other improvements where necessary to allow a rapid and effective ground and aerial response to fire (USFWS 2020). Continue research in the fields of genomic technologies and genetically modified mosquitoes for disease control and their field application (USFWS 2020)",Oceanian,,false,false,Global

These populations are at risk of extinction through exposure to stochastic factors such as severe climatic events or the introduction of invasive species. It is therefore assessed as Endangered.","It is found in dense cover near the ground, particularly around the shrubs Sida fallax and Solanum nelsonii on Nihoa (VanderWerf et al. 2011, MacDonald 2012), and Scaevola taccada and the grass Eragrostis variabilis on Laysan (Kohley and Rutt 2012, Wilcox et al. 2013, Dalton et al. 2014). The Nihoa Millerbird is relatively evenly distributed across Nihoa, but is slightly more prevalent on upslope (north-ward) (Gorresen et al. 2016). Surveys also indicate a near complete use of available habitat during 2010 to 2014 (Gorresen et al. 2016). On Nihoa the main foods include small beetles, spiders, roaches and larvae (Morin et al. 1997, MacDonald 2012). The original, naturally occurring Laysan population was thought to have fed primarily on moths (Henshaw 1902), however, the species is thought to be a catholic feeder, feeding on the most readily available arthropod prey items (MacDonald 2012). Pairs show year-to-year fidelity in specific territories, with nesting apparently correlated with precipitation and most breeding taking place in the winter months (peaking January-March), although the breeding period may be extended in years of high summer rainfall (MacDonald 2012). The translocated population on Laysan breeds from at least February through September, with a peak in spring-summer months (Wilcox et al. 2013). Nests are located in dense shrubs or bunchgrass, and two eggs are generally laid (Morin et al. 1997, Wilcox et al. 2013).","The species exhibits extensive and strikingly low levels of genetic diversity as a result of recent severe bottlenecks (Addison and Diamond 2011). These may have been caused by climatic events, anthropogenic influences (impacts of Nihoa's prehistoric human population, and perhaps of modern introduction of nonnative plants and insects) or other stochastic fluctuations in habitat and consequently in population size. The Millerbird's extinction on Laysan in the early 20th century was ultimately caused by the introduction of rabbits and livestock, which denuded the island of vegetation (severe declines in the species' invertebrate prey and suitable habitat). On Nihoa, the population size is probably regulated primarily by precipitation levels, which affect the abundance of arthropod prey (extended droughts for example, are likely to have a negative impact). Hurricanes may be an increasing threat to this species as a result of climate change (USFWS 2017). Severe weather events may cause direct mortality of Millerbirds; a single severe storm could extinguish an entire subpopulation (USFWS 2010). Climate models indicate that hurricanes in the northwestern Pacific are expected to increase in intensity (5.4%), frequency (2.8%) and duration (1.4%) by 2100 (Emanuel et al. 2008). The Laysan population is likely to become more vulnerable than the Nihoa population based on dynamic wave-driven inundation projections (Gorresen et al. 2016). A recent modelling study of passive sea-level rise (SLR) showed that approximately 4 percent of the total land areas in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands will be lost with +1.0 m of SLR and 26 percent will be lost with +2.0 m SLR (Reynolds et al. 2012). For Laysan Island this was predicted to be 7 percent at 1.0 m SLR and 24 percent at +2.0 SLR (Reynolds et al. 2012). However, thus far the subpopulations have survived severe weather without apparent long-term effects (C. Farmer in litt. 2022). Drought is likely to be exacerbated by climate change and this may be causing declines (R. Rounds in litt 2022). Since the species has an extremely small range and severely low levels of genetic diversity, it is also particularly vulnerable to extinction through exposure to disease and the introduction of invasive species. Population outbreaks of the non-native grasshoppers (e.g. the Gray Bird Grasshopper Schistocerca nitens) have periodically denuded 90% of the island's vegetated area, especially the shrubs in which Millerbirds nest. Outbreaks such as these may have been responsible for reductions in the bird population to well below 200 individuals in 1994, 1996, and 2005 (Latchininsky 2008). Habitat degradation is also caused by invasive plant species such as sandbur Cenchrus echinatus. Fire is a past and potential threat (Morin et al. 1997) and introduction of detrimental non-native species, especially predators such as rats (Rattus spp.) is a permanent possibility. Yellow crazy ants Anoplolepis gracilipes may pose an additional threat given that the species are present at the Hawaii base yard where packing for trips to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands occurs (USFWS 2017). Nihoa and Laysan Finches (Telespiza ultima and T. cantans, respectively) may prey upon the eggs of Millerbirds, but since these species evolved together, it is unlikely to present a significant threat (M.A. MacDonald in litt. 2008). Avian diseases (West Nile virus and avian influenza) also pose a risk if introduced to the islands (USFWS 2017).","The naturally occurring population on Nihoa was estimated at 489  ± 70 (SD) in 2010, 699 ± 78 in 2011, 610 ± 210 in 2012, 468 ± 166 in 2013, and 893 ± 303 in 2014 (Gorresen et al. 2016). The most recent estimate of the population on Laysan was 164 in September 2014 (Dalton et al. 2014, Freifeld et al. 2016). Given that the Nihoa subpopulation is thought to fluctuate widely, the population is tentatively placed in the band 250-999 mature individuals. This estimate equates to 375-1,499 individuals in total, rounded here to 350-1,500 individuals.",Unknown,"Acrocephalus familiaris is endemic to the islands of Nihoa and Laysan in the north-western Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A. After becoming extinct on Laysan between 1916 and 1923, translocations were undertaken in September 2011 and August 2012, when a total of 50 Millerbirds were moved from Nihoa to Laysan, a distance of 1,037 km (Freifeld et al. 2016). ","",Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayNihoa is part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument (H. Freifeld in litt. 2010). Legal access is controlled by a permit system that restricts access to biologists, other researchers, and native Hawaiian cultural practitioners. Strict biosecurity protocols are followed to ensure that legal visitors do not accidentally introduce new species via seeds, eggs or arthropods travelling on clothes and equipment. Visiting scientists make efforts to control alien plants by hand pulling and other methods (e.g. Plentovich et al. 2014). A scoping document for translocations was produced in 2007, identifying Laysan, Kure and Lisianski as the most suitable islands on the basis of island size, elevation and a lack of predators (Morin and Conant 2007). Development of detailed translocation, release, and monitoring methods were finalized in 2011 (Farmer et al. 2011) and two successful translocations to Laysan in 2011 and 2012 resulted in a nascent population there, last estimated at 164 birds (Freifeld et al. 2016). The population will continue to be monitored and the data used to determine population persistence and growth. New, more rigorous population monitoring methods were introduced on Nihoa in recent years (Gorresen et al. 2012, Gorresen et al. 2016); these are expected to yield estimates of total numbers with improved confidence and, if monitoring is done annually, early detection of significant trends. Conservation and Research Actions ProposedContinue monitoring millerbirds on Nihoa and Laysan. Monitoring on Laysan is particularly important to document vital rates, dispersal, and habitat use, and the role of these in population persistence. Continued study of the reintroduced population on Laysan is essential to inform conservation translocations of this and other Hawaiian passerines in the future. However, monitoring and study on Laysan has become far more challenging since the closure of the long-term, year-round USFWS field camp on the island in 2013. Continue to refine survey protocols for estimating Nihoa Millerbird population sizes and trends that minimise impacts to other resident species (USFWS 2017). Long-term research that does not impact the islands negatively is needed to study the species ecology (USFWS 2017). Continue to monitor Nihoa for the highly invasive plant Cenchrous echinatus that was re-discovered in September 2011, and continue to monitor and manage invasive alien plants on Laysan (e.g., Morin and Conant 1998). Ensure strict adherence to quarantine protocols to prevent further accidental introductions of alien species. Carry out additional translocations to establish populations on other islands as appropriate (S. Conant in litt. 2008, Freifeld et al. 2016).",Oceanian,,false,false,Global

The population is small and declining at a rate exceeding 60% in ten years and is highly susceptible to avian malaria, with climate change projected to cause an increase in the elevation below which regular transmission occurs.","Originally, it occurred in native forests throughout Kaua'i. Today, it occurs above 600 m in `ohi`a forest, but is commonest in western koa-`ohi`a forest (USFWS 1983, Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987, Lindsey et al. 1998). Preference for koa-`ohi`a may be attributable to koa itself (Conant et al. 1998), or the abundance of the introduced banana poka in the western parts of its range (Scott et al. 1985). It feeds by gleaning insects from trunks and branches (Pratt et al. 1987, Lindsey et al. 1998), and takes insects and nectar from flowers, apparently thriving on banana poka nectar (USFWS 1983, Conant et al. 1998, Lindsey et al. 1998). It is also an active excavator, hammering and flaking off bark to locate arthropods underneath (T. Snetsinger in litt. 2000).","Clearance of the lowland forests on Kaua`i removed most of the habitat used by this species (USFWS 1983, Lindsey et al. 1998). Current threats include predation from cats and rodents, disease (carried by introduced mosquitoes), ongoing habitat degradation by ungulates and invasive plants and (probably) competition from non-native birds (Lindsey et al. 1998, P. Baker in litt. 1999, J. M. Scott in litt. 1999, P. Roberts in litt. 2007, Paxton et al. 2018). Introduced mosquitoes, which spread avian pox and malaria, are now common at 900 m, and may be breeding as high as 1,200 m elevation (Glad and Crampton 2015). Climate change is projected to cause an increase in the elevation below which transmission of avian malaria occurs (Liao et al. 2017). Under a 2oC warming scenario and an increase in rainfall over high-elevation forests during the next 100 years, in keeping with climate model predictions for the region, the prevalence of malaria on Kaua`i is predicted to increase within the remaining habitat (Benning et al. 2002). The 17 oC isotherm, below which Plasmodium prevalence peaks, is predicted to shift upwards by around 300 m, decreasing the area of forest where Plasmodium prevalence is limited by 85% (Benning et al. 2002). Such changes are already associated with increased prevalence of avian malaria in this species (Atkinson et al. 2014) and the species' range is contracting (Paxton et al. 2016). High densities of this species in an area containing avian malaria has previously suggested some level of resistance (Foster et al. 2004), but the species is currently undergoing steep declines and considered vulnerable to extinction from increasing disease prevalence (Paxton et al. 2020, 2022). Feral pigs facilitate the spread of both alien plants and mosquitoes and, with other ungulates, continue to degrade native forests (Pratt 1994, VanderWerf 2012). Invasive plants have degraded significant portions of Kôke`e State Park and threaten the remainder of the habitat (P. Roberts in litt. 2007, Behnke et al. 2016). In addition to exacerbating the threat of introduced diseases, climate change is predicted to increase the geographic extent and intensity of habitat loss, invasive plants and non-native predators (Paxton et al. 2018). This species' restriction to Kaua`i and dependence on canopy species makes it vulnerable to catastrophic events such as hurricanes (P. Roberts in litt. 2007) which have caused substantial declines in the past (Pratt 1993, 1994). The emergence of the Ceratocystis wilt pathogen that causes rapid ‘ohi‘a death may also be a potential threat (Camp et al. 2019).","Surveys in 2018 placed the population at 6,987 individuals (95% CI: 4,672–9,183) (Paxton et al. 2020), roughly equivalent to 3,100-6,100 mature individuals overall. Assuming declines have continued at the same rate (the most recent population estimate suggests an overall decline of c.57% within the time period 2008-2018 [Paxton et al. 2020]), this would now place the population in the band 2,200-4,400 mature individuals. There is also thought to be a small, isolated population in the Makaleha Mountains (Camp et al. 2009), however this is precautionarily assumed not to host mature individuals given the lack of recent records.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Kaua'i in the Hawaiian Islands (USA). It is common in the uplands including the Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve and especially in Kôke`e State Park, and an isolated population occurs in the Makaleha Mountains (USFWS 1983, Pratt 1993, Conant et al. 1998). Historically it ranged down to coastal elevations, as indicated by fossil evidence (P. Roberts in litt. 2007).","",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayIts habitat is partially protected from development by the Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve, the Kôke`e State Park (P. Roberts in litt. 2007), and several Natural Area Reserves (L. Crampton in litt. 2016). Portions of the Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve and the Hono O Na Pali reserve have been fenced (VanderWerf 2012). Removal of ungulates and invasive plants is ongoing. Weed control has been conducted by The Nature Conservancy and Kōke‘e Resource Conservation Program (VanderWerf 2012). Also, since 2014, expanding grids of Goodnature A24 rat traps have protected nests and breeding birds in the Alaka’i Wilderness Preserve (L. Crampton in litt. 2016). Development of genetic tools to reduce transmission of avian malaria is ongoing. This includes transgenic or genetically modified mosquitoes that have reduced ability to transmit pathogens and also incompatible insect techniques, for example using a different strain of Wolbachia bacteria to produce males that cannot produce viable offspring (USFWS 2017, Miranda Paez et al. 2022). Conservation Actions ProposedConduct research into its biology and limiting factors (Lindsey et al. 1998).

It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.,"It has adapted relatively well to forests of non-native trees, but is most abundant in native forests, particularly where koa trees dominate (Lindsey et al. 1998). It nests and forages in urban areas where enough trees grow (Lindsey et al. 1998). Little is known about its diet, but it probably feeds primarily on small insects and other arthropods, taking nectar and fruit as secondary food sources (Lindsey et al. 1998).","Feral ungulates and introduced predators are likely to have contributed to historical declines (Lindsey et al. 1998) and to be continuing limiting factors. There is thought to be continued loss of much of the remaining areas of lowland native habitats to development and invasive plants (Camp et al. 2009). Diseases spread by introduced mosquitoes were probably also a major factor, but some populations have developed some degree of resistance to avian malaria such that they can persist at lower elevations, and this may explain recent population increases in lowland areas (Lindsey et al. 1998, 2020; Krend 2011). Avian pox is potentially another threat to the species (Lindsey et al. 2020).","The population was estimated at 51,800 (46,500–57,100), based on a survey in 1991, with extrapolation of the observed densities to occupied habitat on the Ko`olau range and south Wai`anae region yielding estimated populations of about 49,500 ± 4,400 and 2,300 ± 900, respectively (Camp et al. 2009). This is placed in the band 40,000-60,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 30,000-40,000 mature individuals. However, surveys on O`ahu, unlike those on other Hawaiian islands, have not been systematic, and these estimates may be too high (R. Shallenberger in litt. 1999). During surveys of the O‘ahu Forest National Wildlife Refuge in 2011, the species was not observed in sufficient numbers to estimate population densities and larger scale surveys are warranted (Camp et al. 2011).",Unknown,"This species is endemic to O'ahu in the Hawaiian Islands (USA).

It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.,"It favours mesic and wet native forests, but is also found at much lower densities in scrub and savanna habitats, especially where `ohi`a and koa trees are present. It occurs in some areas where introduced plants dominate, but is absent in others, its range being negatively correlated with the widespread exotic banana poka. It feeds primarily on fruit and berries, but also on insects (especially caterpillars), snails and fleshy flower bracts of the `ie`ie vine (Berger 1972, Scott et al. 1986). The species plays an important role as a seed disperser of native plants and its absence from areas where it once occurred may be limiting the regeneration of native understorey (L. Pejchar in litt. 2007).","Habitat clearance for development, firewood, timber, croplands and pasture inevitably caused considerable contractions in this species' range, with most forests below 800 m having been converted to agricultural or urban uses. The spread of feral ungulates into native forests has caused habitat degradation, and in some areas non-native plants have replaced the natural habitat (USFWS and Hawai`i Forest Bird Recovery Team 1982, Loope and Medeiros 1995). Feral pigs Sus domesticus are particularly disruptive and facilitate the spread of introduced, disease-carrying mosquitoes (USFWS and Hawai`i Forest Bird Recovery Team 1982, Anderson and Stone 1993). Pigs also damage and destroy understorey plants that provide the fruit resources that the species depends upon (L. Pejchar in litt. 2007). Current avian predators include Hawaiian Hawk Buteo solitarius, Hawaiian Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus sandwichensis and Barn Owl Tyto alba. Introduced mammalian predators including rats Rattus spp., cats Felis catus and mongooses Herpestes auropunctatus are a further significant limiting factor (Wakelee and Fancy 1999). Avian malaria and avian poxvirus have likely contributed to the disappearance of this species from areas of its former range and continue to be threats, although prevalence of avian malaria is low and the persistence of some lower elevation populations suggests that some individuals are resistant to or at least tolerant of current strains of avian pox and malaria (Wakelee and Fancy 2020). Ectoparasites, particularly chewing lice, are thought to be an additional threat (Freed et al. 2008).","The population was estimated to total c.170,000 birds based on surveys in 1976-1979 (Scott et al. 1986), including 56,000 ± 3,000 in Ka'ü, on southern slope of Mauna Loa Volcano, which may be separate from the 113,000 ± 3,000 in remainder of range because of deforested rangeland in Kapäpala tract (Scott et al. 1986). 13,620 (95% CI: 9,581–19,645) individuals are estimated to occur in Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge (Kendall et al. 2022). The global population estimate is roughly equivalent to 110,000 mature individuals overall.",Unknown,"Myadestes obscurus is endemic to Hawai'i in the Hawaiian Islands (USA) where it formerly occurred almost throughout the island. It is now restricted to the southern and eastern slopes of the island, largely above 1,000 m, c.25-30% of its former range (Scott et al. 1986, Wakelee and Fancy 1999). Here the species is encountered regularly in forests with some native tree component (R. Camp in litt. 2007). The population may be divided by the deforested rangeland of the Kapapala Tract, and a third possibly disjunct population exists above 2000 m on Mauna Loa (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987), where it is widespread in suitable habitat (T.

During the 1990s, efforts were made to reduce the feral pig population by Hawaiian conservation authorities and private landowners (Anderson and Stone 1993). Reforestation of upland pastures is ongoing (T. Pratt in litt. 2007). There is considerable interest in re-establishing the species on the western slopes of the island (T. Pratt in litt. 2007). Large areas have been fenced to exclude feral ungulates, and control and removal is ongoing (Wakelee and Fancy 2020). Control of alien mammalian predators such as rats and feral cats has been attempted in only a few areas using ground-based control methods (Wakelee and Fancy 2020). Larger-scale efforts involving aerial drops of toxicants to control rodents are being planned (Wakelee and Fancy 2020).Conservation Actions ProposedCarry out surveys to obtain an up-to-date estimate for the population size. Determine whether there is a genetic or immunological basis for disease resistance by some individuals (Wakelee and Fancy 2020). Monitor population trends through regular surveys. Control mammalian predators, including cats, mongooses and rats, effectively and continuously because of rapid rates of recolonisation and reproduction (Wakelee and Fancy 1999, 2020). Eradicate feral ungulates, including cattle and pigs, and exclude them from protected areas of forest (Wakelee and Fancy 2020). Improve methods for controlling avian disease (Wakelee and Fancy 2020).

Both males and females incubate and brood and provision nestlings, with nests being placed in a variety of native trees including ‘Ōhi‘a, ‛Ōlapa, ‛Ōhelo, Alani, Kanawao, Kāwa‛u, and Lapalapa, with mean nest height being low compared to other native arboreal cup nesters on Kaua‛i at 5.1  ± 2.2 m SD (Hammond 2016).

Prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases is likely to increase with climate change (Atkinson et al. 2014). Habitat degradation as a result of invasive alien plants and ungulates is ongoing (Behnke et al. 2016, VanderWerf 2020).

It is therefore assessed as Vulnerable.","The species is most abundant in mesic forest in valleys (VanderWerf et al. 2001), preferring mixed-species forest with a tall canopy and well-developed understorey, at 200-800 m (VanderWerf et al. 2001). The species is less common in drier forest (Vanderwerf 1998). It feeds on insects and other invertebrates (VanderWerf 1998).","Habitat loss to development has been extensive, with 56% of its former range lost to agricultural or urban development (VanderWerf et al. 2001), though most areas where the species still occurs are zoned for conservation and are protected from development. The primary threats responsible for the decline of the species are nest predation by alien Black Rats (Rattus rattus) and mosquito-borne diseases (VanderWerf et al. 2013). Nest-predation by black rats is the most serious current problem (VanderWerf et al. 1997, 2001; VanderWerf 1998, 2009), leading to a male-biased sex ratio (VanderWerf et al. 2001). Feral cats Felis catus and mongooses Herpestes auropunctatus are additional predators. Invasive alien plants promote high rat abundance because many alien trees bear fruit or nuts that are attractive to rats (VanderWerf 2009). Fires are known to destroy key habitat and promote the spread of alien plants on O'ahu (USFWS 2006), with negative consequences for nest success (VanderWerf 2009). Feral pigs Sus scrofa also facilitate the spread of invasive alien plants.Diseases such as avian pox and malaria are a problem throughout its range given that there are no high elevation refugia, increasing mortality of adults by c.10-25% and possibly preventing birds from nesting (E. VanderWerf in litt. 1999, VanderWerf et al. 2006). However, ‘elepaios have greater immunity to introduced mosquito-borne diseases than most of the Hawaiian honeycreepers and the species has persisted despite high disease prevalence (VanderWerf 2012a). Malaria prevalence in the species has been recorded at 87%, with 36% of birds showing signs of avian pox (VanderWerf et al. 2006). High prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases and local declines in the species' population are associated with high rainfall (USFWS 2006, VanderWerf et al. 2006).","The total population was estimated at 1,261 mature individuals (95% CI=1,205-1,317) following surveys conducted from 2011-2012 (VanderWerf et al. 2013), consisting of about 477 breeding pairs and 307 single males. This total includes 592 males (95% CI= 554-630) and 369 females in the Ko'olau Mountains and 192 males and 84 females in the Wai' anae Mountains (VanderWerf et al. 2011a, 2013). The genetically effective population size may be even lower because of the fragmented distribution (VanderWerf et al. 2001, 2013). The largest subpopulations are in the central (523 mature individuals) and southeastern Ko’olau (403 mature individuals) Mountains, with smaller subpopulations in ‘Ekahanui (100 mature individuals), Schofield Barracks West Range (104 mature individuals), Palehua (41 mature individuals), Waikane and Kahana Valleys (24 mature individuals), and several tiny fragments containing 1-5 mature individuals each (VanderWerf 2012a).",Decreasing,Chasiempis ibidis is endemic to O'ahu in the Hawaiian Islands (USA).,"",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCritical habitat has been designated on O'ahu (USFWS 2001). The species has benefitted from conservation measures targeted at endangered honeycreepers on the island, including fencing, ungulate control and forest restoration. Rat control in 1996-2008 resulted in a 25% increase in survival of breeding females and a 100% increase in reproductive success, stabilising studied populations (VanderWerf and Smith 2002, VanderWerf 2009). Further rat control has taken place at other populations, but efficacy has been variable (VanderWerf et al. 2011b). Captive breeding has been suggested but is unlikely to be effective unless threats in the wild are adequately managed (E. VanderWerf in litt. 2016). Recent research has shown that nesting height of Oahu Elepaios is increasing through evolution by selection from rat predation, which has lead to an overall increase in nest success in at least one population (VanderWerf 2012b). Rat control is ongoing and in 2014, installing and maintaining large-scale trapping grids of Goodnature A24 traps were added to control measures (USFWS 2019).

The population is small and declining primarily owing to avian malaria and rat predation. The species is highly susceptible to avian malaria, with climate change causing an increase in the elevation below which regular transmission occurs.","It is now restricted to montane mesic and wet forest at 1,200-2,350 m (mainly 1,500-2,100 m), and is absent from adjacent areas dominated by exotic trees (Mountainspring 1987, T. Pratt in litt. 1999, D. Leonard in litt. 2012). This habitat is probably marginal, as heavy rainfall leads to drastic losses during the breeding season (Simon et al. 2000). It feeds mainly on the larvae and pupae of wood- and fruit-boring beetles, moths and other invertebrates (Mountainspring 1987, Simon et al. 1997). Range size is 9.29 ha and territories are defended year-round (Pratt et al. 2001, Warren et al. 2015). The nest is cup-shaped and placed in the outer canopy forks of mature ohia (Metrosideros polymorpha), a situation that may afford some protection from introduced predators (Simon et al. 2000). During the breeding season (between November and June), one chick is usually raised per year and young are dependent on parents for 5-8 months (Lockwood et al. 1994, T. Pratt in litt. 1999, J. C. Simon in litt. 1999, Simon et al. 2000). Studies in the Hanawi Natural Area Reserve (NAR) in east Maui in 2006-2011 found nest success probability of 19 % (n=30) and seasonal nest success of 46 %, with 49 of 106 breeding pairs monitored successfully producing one fledgling (Mounce et al. 2013).","The primary threat to this species is introduced avian disease to which it is highly susceptible, particularly avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum), causing it to have a limited distribution at higher elevations (Atkinson et al. 2014, Judge et al. 2021). Climate change is increasing the elevation below which regular transmission of avian malaria occurs and climate modelling has suggested a possible range contraction of c. 75% by 2100 (Fortini et al. 2015) although the species is likely to become functionally extinct in as little as 10 years (Mounce et al. 2018). Avian pox virus is an additional threat (USFWS 2019). From 1945-1995, the invasion of feral pigs on Haleakala caused chronic habitat degradation (Loope and Medeiros 1995) and facilitated the spread of disease-carrying mosquitoes into remote rainforests (Pratt 1994). The species continues to be threatened by invasive ungulates, however the entire range is now fenced and mostly ungulate free (Warren et al. 2021). Weather influences the survival of young and thus potential recruitment rates (Simon et al. 1997, Becker et al. 2010), with nest failures frequently occurring after heavy rainfall (Warren et al. 2021). Other limiting factors include logging, cattle ranching and silviculture (VanderWerf 2012) and predation and competition from exotic bird and insect species (Mountainspring 1987, Simon et al. 1997). Rats have been observed high in native 'olapa trees and are both a potential predator of eggs and young and a potential source of competition for berries. Although they have not been documented as predators of parrotbill nests, rats have been documented predating Akohekohe nests at similar heights. Mounce et al. (2013) found no significant difference in reproductive success between birds in an area with predator control (bait stations loaded with rodenticide and snap traps) and those in an area without, suggesting that current control efforts may not be sufficient. Nest predation by Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus) has been observed, though its extent and effect is unknown. Removal of small mammal nest predators may result in owl populations switching to a greater proportion of birds in their diet (Mounce 2008). Cats (Felis catus) and the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus) are also likely predators of the species (Simon et al. 2020). Invasive plants represent a threat to habitat and require constant monitoring (D. Leonard in litt. 2012). Given its slow life-history traits and heavy reliance on adult survival, the species is particularly at risk and less likely to recover from declines (Mounce et al. 2018).","During 1976-1983, it was estimated to number c.500 individuals, of which 71% (c. 355) occurred above 1,500 m (Scott et al. 1986). Density surveys in 1997 and 2001 suggested similar numbers in the 35 km2 of remaining suitable habitat above 1,525 m (Simon et al. 1997, D. Leonard in litt. 2012). The total population size was estimated to number 513 ± 143 individuals in 1980, 447 ± 157 in 1992, 544 ± 153 in 2001 and 291 ± 69 in 2011 (Judge et al. 2021). Overall density was even lower in 2017 (0.05 ± 0.02 birds/ha), with an estimated total abundance of 157 ± 67 (95% CI 44–312) individuals in their 2,992 ha range (Judge et al. 2021). This is roughly equivalent to 105 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Maui in the Hawaiian Islands (U.S.A.), where it is found on the north-eastern slopes of Haleakala, although fossil evidence indicates that it once occurred in the lowlands and on Moloka'i.","",Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayLife history and demographic studies have been ongoing since 2005 (D. Leonard in litt. 2012), with genetic studies ongoing since 1996 (Mounce et al. 2015). The East Maui watershed is cooperatively managed with fencing at c.1,070 m and removal of feral ungulates (Loope and Medeiros 1995, P. Baker in litt. 1999). In the Waikamoi Preserve, Hanawi Natural Area Reserve and Haleakala National Park, conservation practices additionally combat the establishment of alien plants and, since the late 1980s, feral pigs have been controlled (Loope and Medeiros 1995, Simon et al. 1997). As a result, the forest understory has recovered well and non-native plant invasions have slowed (Loope and Medeiros 1995, T. Pratt in litt. 1999). The entire range is now fenced and mostly ungulate free (Warren et al. 2021). Intensive control of rats (Rattus spp.) is underway in a portion of Hanawī Natural Area Reserve, Waikamoi Preserve, and Kahikinui’s Nakula Natural Area Reserve (USFWS 2019). A small population exists in captivity, having bred for the first time in 2000 (Maxfield 2000), and numbering 12 individuals in 2015. However, the captive population numbered just 2 non-breeding individuals in 2022 (Paxton et al. 2022). The Leeward Haleakala Watershed Restoration Partnership has been established to help restore the south side of Maui's forests in partnership with State agencies (H. Mounce in litt. 2008) and 1,100 ha of mesic koa forest is currently being restored on leeward east Maui (Mounce et al. 2014). In 2019, seven individuals from Hanawī Natural Area Reserve and seven from the captive population managed by San Diego Zoo Global were translocated to the Nakula Natural Area Reserve on the leeward slope of Haleakalā in an attempt to establish a second population (Warren et al. 2021). However, all birds either died or disappeared, with necropsies indicating avian malaria as the primary cause of death (Warren et al. 2021). Development of genetic tools to reduce transmission of avian malaria is ongoing. This includes transgenic or genetically modified mosquitoes that have reduced ability to transmit pathogens and also incompatible insect techniques, for example using a different strain of Wolbachia bacteria to produce males that cannot produce viable offspring (Judge et al. 2021, Miranda Paez et al. 2022).Conservation and Research Actions ProposedCarry out surveys to obtain an up-to-date estimate of the population size. Continue to study life history and ecology (D. Leonard in litt. 2012). Continue genetic research in disease immunity in Hawaiian honeycreepers (Paxton et al. 2018).

It feeds on invertebrates and nectar (Scott et al. 1986, Pratt et al. 1987). It lives in small family groups of 2-6 birds (Baker and Baker 2000). Mean home range size is 0.86 ± 0.09 ha (Warren et al. 2015). The species is found below 1,500 m but in reduced densities due to avian malaria, with most detections above 1,200 m (Judge et al. 2021). ","Clearance of lowland forest has inevitably resulted in range contraction, but its absence from suitable habitat at lower elevations is attributed to the presence of disease-carrying mosquitoes. The primary threat to this species is introduced avian disease to which it is highly susceptible, particularly avian malaria (Plasmodium relictum). The population of the Maui ‘Alauahio is larger than the two other endemic Hawaiian honeycreepers left on Maui, likely due to its ability to adapt to non-native forests, its generalist diet and small home ranges, and its higher fecundity (Judge et. al 2021). However, climate change increasing the elevation below which regular transmission of avian malaria occurs (Atkinson et al. 2014, Fortini et al. 2015, Judge et al. 2021). Avian pox is an additional threat to the species (VanderWerf 2012). Feral ungulates, especially pigs, have also caused extensive habitat loss and degradation (Scott et al. 1986, Loope and Medeiros 1995, USFWS and Hawai`i DLNR 1999) and mosquitoes have followed the spread of feral pigs into upland areas (Loope and Medeiros 1995). Habitat degradation as a result of invasive plants, feral pigs and goats within the range is ongoing (Judge et al. 2021). A number of birds and insects are potential competitors, and rats are confirmed predators of eggs and nestlings (Baker and Baker 2020). Other predators may include Short-eared Owl (Asio flammeus), Barn Owl (Tyto alba), Small Indian Mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus), and feral cats (Felis catus) (Baker and Baker 2020). Extreme weather events, like hurricanes and wildfires, amplified by climate change may also impact this species, especially the subpopulation in Kula Forest Reserve as recent events (i.e. 2007 fire and 2014 hurricane Iselle) have shown impacts to the forest habitat integrity (L. Berthold in litt. 2020). Invasive plant species such as strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) pose a threat through reduced habitat quality, though this species can nest and forage on some non-native plant species (VanderWerf 2012).","The total population size was estimated to number 74,997 ± 8,520 individuals in 1980, 168,702 ± 5,786 in 1992, 124,027 ± 12,663 in 2001 and 96,105 ± 10,014 in 2011 (Judge et al. 2021). The most recent population estimate in 2017 was 99,060 ± 9,510 individuals (95% CI 88,502–106,954) (Judge et al. 2021), roughly equivalent to 60,000-70,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Paroreomyza montana is endemic to Maui in the Hawaiian Islands, U.S.A.

The core areas where this species reaches its highest population densities are within three protected areas: Waikamoi Preserve, Hanawi Natural Area Reserve and Haleakalā National Park, where fencing and control of feral ungulates has resulted in the slow regeneration of native ʻōhiʻa forests (Loope and Medeiros 1995, Lepson and Freed 1997, Simon et al. 1997, USFWS and Hawai'i DLNR 1999). Control of invasive plants and predators is ongoing within the range (Baker and Baker 2020). Habitat restoration within Nakula Natural Area Reserve and other Leeward forests on South Haleakalā may provide new habitat areas in the future (Department of Land and Natural Resources 2015). Research conducted on home range size, combined with demographic and genetic data can be used to design effective translocation plans (Warren et al. 2015). Development of genetic tools to reduce transmission of avian malaria is ongoing. This includes transgenic or genetically modified mosquitoes that have reduced ability to transmit pathogens and also incompatible insect techniques, for example using a different strain of Wolbachia bacteria to produce males that cannot produce viable offspring (Judge et al. 2021, Miranda Paez et al. 2022).Conservation Actions ProposedCarry out surveys to obtain an up-to-date estimate of the population size. Study its population dynamics and demography (Baker and Baker 2000). Continue genetic research in disease immunity in Hawaiian honeycreepers (Paxton et al. 2018). Continue research in the fields of genomic technologies and genetically modified mosquitoes for disease control and their field application (Paxton et al. 2018). Monitor population trends through regular surveys. Initiate landscape-scale control of predators (Judge et al. 2021). Implement a landscape-level mosquito control programme (Paxton et al. 2018). Extend habitat restoration to areas outside the three wildlife protection areas (Loope and Medeiros 1995). Encourage the regeneration of native high-elevation forests (Baker and Baker 2000, Judge et al. 2021). When possible, translocate the species to establish several widely distributed populations (Baker and Baker 2000), including on the leeward side of east Maui or mountains in west Maui (H. Mounce in litt. 2007); this likely cannot occur until mosquito control or eradication happens in these areas (C. Warren in litt. 2020). ",Oceanian,,false,false,Global

It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.","It occurs in a broad range of habitats up to 2,700 m, from lowland agricultural areas to all types of forest (Thiollay 1994, Hall et al 1997). However, most successful nesting is restricted to native ‘ōhi‘a trees Metrosideros polymorpha (which are slow growing and generally in decline) (J. Klavitter in litt. 1999). It benefits from some anthropogenic changes, for example, it feeds on introduced game-birds, passerines and rodents, and uses edge habitat around sugar-cane fields and orchards for hunting (Hall et al 1997, J. Klavitter in litt. 1999). The species reproduces at a slow rate, and there are observations that incubation lasts for 38 days, nestlings fledge after 59-63 days, and parents care for fledglings for an average of 30.2 weeks (Griffin et al. 1998). Parents feed nestlings with mostly mammalian and avian prey.","Continuing threats include forest clearance for agricultural and other developments, the actions of introduced ungulates that degrade native forests and inhibit their regeneration, repeated nest disturbance, and perhaps road-kills (Scott et al. 1986, Thiollay 1994, J. Klavitter in litt. 1999). Nesting habitat in particular has been reduced, with recruitment of M. polymorpha restricted by competition from exotic plants in some areas (M. Gorresen in litt. 2007). The species is threatened by the conversion of land used for pasture and sugar-cane to eucalyptus plantations, and residential development in extensive areas of subdivided land, mainly in Puna District (T. Pratt in litt. 2007). Rapid ʻŌhiʻa Death, a fungal pathogen infecting ‘ōhi‘a, is a severe threat to the integrity of native ‘ōhi‘a forests (USFWS 2020). However, Hawaiian hawks nest and hunt in a variety of native and nonnative habitats and may not be significantly affected by the ongoing threats to native habitat (USFWS 2020). It formerly suffered extensively from shooting and while this remains a threat, it is not thought to be having a significant impact given the population's stability over the past several decades (USFWS 2020). An increase in fire frequency due to alien plants and drought may reduce the amount of available habitat for nesting and perching, and this is likely to be exacerbated by climate change (USFWS 2020). Climate change is also increasing the risk of hurricanes and tropical storms (USFWS 2020).","Using a mean density of 0.004 birds/ha observed in 1993, and an estimate of 400,000 ha of suitable habitat on Hawai`i, an estimate of 1,600 birds, including 1,120 adults (560 pairs), was calculated by Hall et al. (1997). A similar estimate of 1,457 individuals was obtained from surveys in 1998-1999 (Klavitter et al. 2003). However, a reanalysis of the 1998-1999 survey data using updated vegetation maps and methods to calculate population and density estimates suggested that the population actually numbered 3,239 (2,610-3,868) birds at this time (Gorreson et al. 2008). Using survey data from 2007, the population was estimated at 3,085 (2,496-3,680) birds, with no significant difference in densities between 1998 and 2007 (Gorreson et al. 2008). This is thought to be roughly equivalent to 1,700-2,500 mature individuals.

In Alaska, these threats are also noted (Schmutz et al. 2020), as is pesticides and the degradation of habitat. However, in both countries the population size of this species is estimated to be increasing; thus, while all are plausible and potentially acting threats, none are considered likely to be causing population declines. Climate change has been noted as a potential future threat, with Zöckler and Lysenko (2000) suggesting that 54% of suitable habitat for this species could be lost by 2070. In the absence of evidence that this is yet impacting the population negatively, this is considered a plausible future threat.","MNRE (2021) indicate that the total population is c.45,000 breeding pairs (c.90,000 mature individuals), which is broadly consistent with spring counts in Alaska typically finding 60,000-80,000 birds, not all of which will be mature individuals (Schmutz et al. 2020). Wetlands International (2022), citing Dooley et al. (2016) for justification, suggest a global population of 158,000 birds, although it is unclear what percentage of these are mature individuals.

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","The species lives on rocky sea coasts, breeding on cliff ledges and under boulders in boreal or low Arctic waters where sea-surface temperatures &lt;15°C (Nettleship, 1996; Lavers et al. 2020). It is a pursuit diver that propels itself through the water with its wings. Razorbills are capable of diving to 120 m depth, but mostly forage nearer the surface. They spend most of their lives at sea, only arriving ashore to reproduce. They mainly overwinter within the boreal water zone either side of the Atlantic (Lavers et al., 2020). This species has been described as coastal rather than pelagic (Huettman et al. 2005), and birds tend to be concentrated within 10 km of the shore (BirdLife International, 2000, Huettman et al., 2005). They are known to consume Krill, Sprat Sprattus sprattus, Sandeels Ammondytes spp. and Capelin amongst other prey (Nettleship, 1996).","The major threats for the razorbill are current and future impacts of climate change, decreasing prey availability, bycatch in gillnets and driftnets, and unregulated hunting (Costa et al. 2019). As a pursuit diver, the species is at risk from being caught in gill-nets and drift-nets, with gill-net fisheries in the North and Baltic Seas known to catch significant numbers (Žydelis et al. 2009, 2013; Skov et al. 2011). Overfishing of important prey species in the Gulf of St Lawrence, east Newfoundland and Grand Banks, Georges Bank, North Sea and Barents Sea is also a threat due to reduction in prey populations (Nettleship, 2018). The role of IUU fishing in prey reductions has not been evaluated (Costa et al. 2019). Razorbills are also at risk from climate change related reductions in the abundance of prey such as Sandeels due to their restricted diet (Sandvik et al. 2005). Past food shortages have coincided with declines in productivity in the North-east of the UK, as well as a decrease in energy content of fish brought to chicks on the Isle of May (Wanless et al. 2005). There are indications that the decline in Sandeel stocks is linked to increasing sea surface temperatures (Heath et al. 2009). A significant negative relationship between productivity and spring sea surface temperature, lagged by one year, has been found, this has been linked to the availability of mid-trophic level forage fish (Lauria et al. 2012). However, a study by Gaston and Woo (2008) showed Razorbills were able to track changes in preferred prey, implying a capability to adapt to climate change. The species is vulnerable to extreme weather, primarily winter storms, which have been linked to large scale mortality in the past (Underwood and Stowe, 1984), due to strong winds preventing feeding and weakening adults. Razorbills are also potentially vulnerable to future sea level rises that may cause flooding in some parts of its range (Sandvik, 2005). Hunting of adults occurs throughout range, with between 2,000 and 200,000 birds killed each year in Iceland, 20% of which are taken illegally (BirdLife International, 2017). Unregulated hunting occurs in Labrador, Newfoundland, Greenland, Faroe Islands, and Norway (Nettleship et al. 2018). Egg collection is thought to have caused declines in the past (Nettleship et al. 2018), but is not considered only a minor issue in the Norwegian North Sea and Skagerrak (TemaNord 2010). This species is considered to be at moderate risk of displacement by offshore windfarms in the UK, but at low risk of collision mortality (Bradbury et al. 2014), with windfarms having a low impact in general (Furness et al. 2013). Studies on the effects of offshore windfarms on Razorbills return variable results, with the population declining around some and remaining stable or increasing around other (Dierschke et al. 2016). An investigation into the potential impacts of offshore windfarms by van Kooten et al. (2018) returned annual population declines of 0.939 and 0.926 for extreme scenarios, while worst-case and best-estimates showed median annual population increases. The effects are thought to depend on the distance to breeding and foraging grounds and effect on prey populations (Vanerman et al. 2015). However, Razorbills were highlighted as one of the more vulnerable species to the adverse effects of tidal turbines off Scottish waters (Furness et al. 2012).Invasive mammalian predators, especially rats and American mink (Neovison vison), represent a threat to Razorbill populations. Presence of rat activity has been linked with declines in Razorbill productivity through disturbance on Calf of Man, U.K. (O'Hanlon and Lambert 2017). The Isle of Canna, West coast Scotland, has also seen declines in Razorbills since early 1990 with introduction of Norway rats which have been observed predating eggs and chicks (Swann 2002). Numbers of Razorbill increased following successful rat eradication on the island in 2005/06 (Swann et al. 2016). Colonies suffer local declines due to American mink and are at high risk of predation, e.g. a decline of 60% was seen in SW Finland after introduction of mink in the 1970s, with the removal of mink being followed by return of breeding colonies (Nordstrom et al. 2003). American mink have had a 'verified impact' in Finland and Sweden (Bonesi &amp; Palazon 2007). Excessive predation by mink can cause exceptionally low chick mean survival rates (Barrett 2015). Razorbills spend the majority of their time at and below the water surface, leading them to be highlighted as vulnerable to habitat degradation, species mortality and loss of reproductive success due to oilspills. Oiling affects Razorbills’ ability to feed and fly (Biliavskiy and Golod 2012). An assessment of the threat that marine aggregate mining poses to Razorbill around the UK suggests that operations would cause disturbance, potentially restrict access to some foraging sites and that the Firth of Forth colonies (ca 2,700 pairs) would be exposed to direct effects through reduced prey availability (Cook and Burton 2010). At present the threat is likely to be at a very minor scale and to have minimal severity, but many areas of the Arctic are opening up to mining developments that may pose a threat to breeding seabirds (Chardine and Mendenhall 1998). High levels of mercury (Hg) found in Razorbills recovered from 2014 winter wreck. Although levels were unlikely to be directly responsible for the high mortality observed, it was concluded to be a major aggravating stress factor for emaciated birds on the edge, with evidence suggesting that stranded seabirds were highly contaminated compared to birds in normal conditions (Fort et al. 2015).","The global population is estimated to number between 838,000–1,660,000 mature individuals, or 1,257,000–2,490,000 total individuals, derived from flyway population estimates (Wetlands International, 2021). The European population is estimated at 519,000–1,070,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International in prep.). This species breeds mostly in Iceland, a population that was once believed to make up 60-70% of the global population (Costa et al. 2019); now, Iceland holds the majority in Europe (41%) but not globally due to increases elsewhere. Europe holds more than 90% of the global population.",Increasing,"The species breeds on islands, rocky shores and cliffs on northern Atlantic coasts, in eastern North America as far south as Maine (U.S.A.), and in western Europe from north-west Russia to north-west France. North American birds migrate offshore and south, ranging from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland (Canada) to New England and New York (U.S.A.) (Nettleship 1996). Eurasian birds also winter at sea, with some moving south as far as the western Mediterranean and North Africa (Nettleship 1996, Merne and Mitchell 2004).","Hunting of adults occurs throughout the range, with between 2,000 and 200,000 birds killed each year in Iceland, 20% of which are taken illegally (BirdLife International, 2017).

It has an extremely small range, wholly confined to one upland area where it is highly vulnerable to stochastic events and habitat quality is continuing to decline. It is therefore assessed as Critically Endangered.","It is now restricted to high-elevation `ohi`a forests of the Alaka‘i Wilderness Preserve at 1,050 to 1,300 meters. It is a ravine specialist, favouring stream banks with a rich understorey (Kepler and Kepler 1983, Scott et al. 1986, Conant et al. 1998). Many recorded nests have been placed in cliffs above streams. It is primarily frugivorous, with arthropods (particularly insects) forming an important dietary component (Kepler and Kepler 1983, Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1999). At least one bird died after malaria infection in the wild, but the species may be more tolerant of avian malaria than others (Herrmann and Snetsinger 1997, Snetsinger et al. 1999). Prevalence of malaria is increasing in this species, and survival of chronically infected birds was similar to that of uninfected birds (Atkinson et al. 2014, VanderWerf et al. 2014). Breeding is typically between March and August. It has potentially high but variable productivity, with pairs producing 0.4 to 4.9 young per year in three years of observation (Snetsinger et al. 1999); annual variation in number of offspring produced is correlated with breeding season precipitation (Fantle-Lepcyk et al. 2016). It is now the sole native frugivore on Kauai, and plays a major role in seed dispersal of native plants within its range (Kaushik et al. 2018).","Avian pox-like lesions have been observed on a mist-netted bird (Herrmann and Snetsinger 1997), and avian malaria is suspected to cause some mortality; at least three captive birds that died soon after release were determined to be infected with malaria (Snetsinger et al. 1999, K. Wakelee in litt. 1999). Disease prevalence in more common species has increased at several locations within the range of this species (VanderWerf 2012). Currently, there are no forested areas on Kaua‘i where the mean ambient temperature prevents the seasonal incursion of malaria; mosquitoes and malaria can survive across all parts of the island, at least periodically. An increase in temperature of 2° C would result in an 85 % decrease in the land area on Kaua‘i where malaria transmission currently is only periodic (Benning et al. 2002). Between 2007-2013, 66 wild Puaiohi were tested for malaria and 11 (22.7%) were determined to be infected, whereas 0 of 7 were infected between 1994-1997 (Atkinson et al. 2014). Although long-term survival of chronically infected individuals has been shown to be similar to that of uninfected individuals and the species may be more tolerant of the disease than others (VanderWerf et al. 2014), it likely does have an impact on overall species survival and its absence from malaria-infected lower elevations suggests the disease has still limited the Puaiohi from inhabiting low elevation areas with suitable nesting habitat (Fantle-Lepczyk et al. 2020). Other factors, such as degradation of native forest by non-native plants may also be limiting their range (Crampton et al. 2017). Several plants, including blackberry (Rubus argutus), Australian Tree Fern (Sphaeropteris cooperi), Kahili Ginger (Hedychium gardnerianum), Daisy Fleabane (Erigeron annuus) and Strawberry Guava (Psidium cattleianum) have significantly altered areas currently and recently occupied by Puaiohi, and have the potential to convert the forest canopy, understorey and cliffs used for nesting substrate to unsuitable habitat (Crampton et al. 2017, Fantle-Lepczyk et al. 2018). The destruction of the understory by feral pigs and goats has been implicated in this species' rarity (Kepler and Kepler 1983) and is an ongoing threat. Predation by native Short-eared Owls (Asio flammeus) and alien mammals (e.g. Black Rats Rattus rattus and cats Felis catus) suppresses productivity and competition for food with introduced insects, birds and mammals may also have negative impacts (Snetsinger et al. 1999, 2005). Low female and juvenile survival likely limits its rate of increase; at least some female and nestling mortality is caused by predation of rats at nests (VanderWerf et al. 2014, L. Crampton pers. obs.), and rats also likely take recently fledged birds. Although hurricanes have caused serious damage to its habitat, the species appeared to recover relatively well, probably because ravines are better sheltered (Conant et al. 1998, Snetsinger et al. 1999). Nevertheless, the population remains highly susceptible to stochastic events; hurricanes have likely caused extirpations in some parts of the range (VanderWerf 2012) and represent a significant plausible future threat. Additionally, given evidence that previous wet season rainfall is associated with nest success of the species, forecasted changes in weather conditions due to anthropogenic climate change may negatively impact the population (Fantle-Lepcyk et al. 2016).","The species has apparently always been rare, though the reasons for this are unclear and the range and population trends are difficult to judge because it is extremely elusive and occurs in highly inaccessible sheltered ravines. Based on data collected in 2011-2013, the population was estimated at 494 breeding individuals (95% CI 414-580) by linking occupancy surveys to habitat characteristics, territory density, and landscape attributes (Crampton et al. 2017), and there is no more recent estimate (L. Crampton in litt. 2023).",Stable,"Myadestes palmeri is endemic to Kaua`i in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), where it is confined to stream valleys and associated ridges above 1,050 m elevation on the southern and central plateau of Alaka‘i Swamp. It was lost from the Waiau and possibly the Halekua drainages (T. Snetsinger per P. Donaldson in litt. 1999), but after Hurricane Iniki it appeared to slightly expand its range in the Mohihi and other drainages (Snetsinger et al. 1999). It formerly occurred in lowland habitats, but probably only locally, and was extirpated from these areas by the end of the 19th century (J. Lepson in litt. 1999, Snetsinger et al. 1999, Burney et al. 2001). ","",Terrestrial,"Conservation and Research Actions UnderwayIt is protected in the Alaka`i Wilderness Preserve and portions of the fenced Hono O Na Pali Natural Area Reserve (KHON2 2014). Research suggests that reducing nest predation by controlling rats may be the best available management option (VanderWerf et al. 2014, Fantle-Lepczyk et al. 2018). Ungulate and predator control is ongoing. Rat poison bait stations were placed near a few nests with moderate success (Snetsinger et al. 1999), and self-resetting Goodnature A24 traps to control rodents have been deployed in the Halehaha area, which is being additionally protected by an ungulate proof fence (Crampton 2016, Else 2016). Several types of rodent-resistant nest boxes have been installed in nesting habitat in Mohihi and Kawaikoi, and one pair was documented to nest successfully in one box. Research into effective nest box designs is ongoing (Fantle-Lepczyk et al. 2018). A captive population was established in 1996, and 14 birds were released into the wild in 1999 (Lieberman and Kuehler 1998, Conrow 1999, USGS News Release 1999, T. Snetsinger in litt. 2000). Releases continued subsequently until 2012, with a total of 222 birds released (Switzer et al. 2013). The captive-bred birds bred with each other and with wild birds (Switzer et al. 2013). Birds released in 1999-2001 survived and reproduced better than birds released from 2002-2006, with roughly only half of the birds released from 2002-2007 surviving for one month or longer. From 2005-2011, long-term survival of 123 captive-bred birds was very low and it was concluded that the release of captive-bred birds has had little effect on the wild population in recent years (VanderWerf et al. 2014), possibly due to saturation of suitable habitat (USFWS 2018). Furthermore, the captive flock was suffering from inbreeding depression (B. Masuda pers. comm.). Thus, the captive breeding programme has been discontinued and all healthy captive-bred Puaiohi were released into the wild in 2016 (The Garden Island 2016). Research on the factors limiting the species and the potential of management actions is ongoing. A species-specific method to survey the entire population was developed in 2011 and was used to predict areas of suitable habitat from 2011-2013 (Crampton et al. 2017). This effort confirmed that likely high density areas of Puaiohi have already been identified, but indicated other areas likely to host low-moderate densities of Puaiohi that have not yet been surveyed. Funding to use song meters and field teams to survey these areas were conducted in 2017 (L. Crampton pers. comm.). Studies of disease prevalence and factors promoting transmission of avian pox and malaria, and disease management options are ongoing (Puaiohi Working Group and Hawaiian Forest Bird Recovery Team 2010, Crampton 2016). Development of genetic tools to reduce transmission of avian malaria is ongoing, and an experimental larval mosquito control program was initiated in Kawaikōī Stream of the NAR in 2016 (USFWS 2018).Conservation and Research Actions ProposedMonitor the population to determine response to management actions and effects of climate change (USFWS 2018). Continue to survey areas of suitable habitat that have not yet been surveyed. Continue and refine occupancy survey methods to provide a more accurate population estimate (Vanderwerf 2012). Finer scale habitat classification, better vegetation data and better topographic mapping is needed to further refine the population estimate (Crampton et al. 2017). Refine mortality and reproductive estimates to help improve model performance and refine population analyses (Fantle-Lepczyk et al. 2018). Further examine how hurricanes and variable rainfall may affect the species (Fantle-Lepczyk et al. 2018). Understand the levels of genetic diversity still extant in the population (Fantle-Lepczyk et al. 2018). Further understand disease resistance and the impacts of malaria on the species (Fantle-Lepczyk et al. 2018). Continue research in the fields of genomic technologies and genetically modified mosquitoes for disease control and their field application (USFWS 2018). Continue to conduct research to determine the impacts of predation and habitat degradation by alien species. Ungulate-proof fencing (completed, ongoing and proposed) will facilitate this research. Investigate potential impacts of cats, owls and avian competitors (Fantle-Lepczyk et al. 2018). Continue habitat management in areas where the species currently exists (USFWS 2018). Expand rat control and provision of predator-proof nest boxes (Fantle-Lepczyk et al. 2018). Remove invasive plants and pigs to promote the return of native vegetation (Fantle-Lepczyk et al. 2018). Prevent additional introductions of invasive species (USFWS 2018).

This species has not been recorded with certainty on Kaua'i since 1989 nor on Hawai'i since 1987, and recent searches specifically for it, alongside extensive surveys for other species on both Kaua'i and Hawai'i, have failed to locate it. It was driven to extinction by habitat loss and degradation, introduced rats, cats, pigs and other non-natives, and in particular as a result of avian malaria and avian pox viruses from introduced mosquitoes.","It was restricted to wet to mesic 'ohi'a forest between 800 and 1,900 m, mainly 1,200-1,500 m (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1998), though historically range expanded into low-elevation forest (Snetsinger et al. 2020). Its bill was adapted to feeding on 'ie'ie Freycinetia arborea, an understory vine, and outside the 'ie'ie fruiting season, it was nomadic in response to seasonal fruit and invertebrate abundance (Snetsinger et al. 1998).","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats, primarily; habitat loss and degradation; avian disease; and predation and competition from non-native species. At least 71 taxa of Hawaiian birds had disappeared before the arrival of Captain James Cook in 1778; 24 more have been extirpated since (Banko and Banko 2009a).With the arrival of the Polynesians between 1000 and 1200 CE, almost all lowland forests were felled and burned to make way for agriculture (Kirch 1982). This loss continued with the arrival of European and American settlers. Forests continued to be cleared until only high-elevation forest remained. Much of the forest that remains has been invaded by non-native species.Hawai'i has a long history of non-native species. When the Polynesians arrived, they brought with them pigs Sus scrofa, dogs Canis familiaris and Polynesian Rats Rattus exulans. With the Europeans and Americans came Black R. rattus and Brown Rats R. norvegicus, cats Felis catus, mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus, feral goats Capra hircus, cattle Bos taurus, deer Axis axis, more than 50 species of birds (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009), plants, invertebrates, and diseases. Introduced ungulates have altered forest structure through herbivory and the dispersal of invasive plants, rendering it far less suitable for Ou and other forest birds. Rats, cats and mongoose predate both nests and adult birds (Lindsey et al. 2009). Rats also compete with Ou for their primary food source, ‘ie‘ie vine Freycinetia arborea (Banko and Banko 2009b), while non-native birds may also compete with them for resources (Foster 2009).Non-native avian diseases introduced to Hawai'i are some of the most pervasive threats faced by native birds and are likely to be the main cause of many previous extinctions. Both avian malaria Plasmodium relictum and avian pox Avipoxvirus spp. are transmitted by the Southern House Mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, currently climatically restricted to elevations below 1,500 m and responsible for the disappearance of many highly susceptible Hawaiian forest birds from elevations below this. The islands of Kaua'i, O'ahu, Moloka'i, and Lānaʻi have no forest above 1500m and therefore offer no refugia from these fatal diseases. Little forest remains above this elevation on Hawai'i and Maui and as the climate warms the elevational range of Culex will increase (Atkinson and Lapointe 2009). Wallows created by feral pigs provide additional breeding habitats for Culex and allow it to infiltrate deeper into forests (Lapointe et al. 2009). By the time avian malaria was thought to have taken hold on Kaua'i in the 1950s Ou were already uncommon and lost from low elevations, suggesting disease is not solely responsible and forest clearance and invasive species also bear considerable responsibility for its decline (L. Crampton in litt. 2023).For species with already small population sizes, natural disasters can be catastrophic. In 1984 thousands of acres of forest, in one of the species' last strongholds, the Upper Waiākea Forest Reserve, were engulfed by the kilometre-wide lava flow (Reynolds and Snetsinger 2001). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest. Three species of bird, including Ou, have not been seen on Kaua'i since these hurricanes (USFWS 2022).","There have been unconfirmed reports of Ou up to 1996, but no confirmed records since 1989. Following methods developed in a series of papers published in 2017 (Akcakaya et al. 2017, Keith et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2017), the probability that this species is extinct based on records and surveys is 0.984, and the probability it is extinct based on threats is 0.941. It is accordingly considered Extinct and the population size is set to 0 mature individuals. Historically Ou were widespread across much of the Hawaiian Archipelago, but were extirpated from O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i and then Lana'i between 1899 and 1931 (Pyle and Pyle 2017). The last confirmed record on Hawai'i was in 1987 (Snetsinger et al. 1998) while the last confirmed record on Kauai was 1989 (Pyle 1986).","","Psittirostra psittacea was originally widespread in the Hawaiian Islands (USA), but was extirpated from O'ahu, Maui, Moloka'i and then Lana'i between 1899 and 1931 (Snetsinger et al. 1998). On Kaua'i, it survived in the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve into the mid-1970s, with c. 62 birds being present during 1968-1973 (USFWS 1983), but only a few in 1981 (Scott et al. 1986), two in 1989 and none since. On Hawai'i, several populations were present in the early 1980s, with c.394 estimated during 1976-1983 (Scott et al. 1986) but, in 1984, a lava-flow from Mauna Loa passed through the Upper Waiakea Forest Reserve, the species' stronghold (Scott et al. 1986, Snetsinger et al. 1998). In 1982 and 1992 Hurricanes ‘Iwa and ‘Iniki battered the Alaka'i swamp, the last known range of Ou on Kaua'i, and had devastating effects on the native forest. Three species of bird, including Ou, were not seen on Kaua'i since these hurricanes (USFWS 2022). However, there have been unconfirmed reports from Koai'e Stream, Alaka'i (Kaua'i) and Pu'u Maka'ala Natural Area Reserve and Kapapala-Ka'u Forest Reserve (Hawai'i) up to 1996 (Snetsinger et al. 1998, J. Lepson in litt. 1999).","Historically Hawaiian honeycreepers were used extensively by indigenous people both for food and feathers (Amante-Helweg and Conant 2009).

It hunted along the upper and lower surfaces of branches, both up and down the trunks (Perkins 1903) probing the bark on living and dead trees. It also gleaned caterpillars from the leaves of low trees (Munro 1960). According to Munro (1960), when feeding it would insert its longer, decurved, upper mandible into crevices and holes to hook out arthropods and then catch them with its tongue and lower mandible. The Koa'e Valley in the Alaka'i Wilderness Preserve (where it was potentially seen in 1995 [Conant et al. 1998]) is at 1,000-1,300 m (Pratt 1994), although it was previously seen as low as 600m (Perkins 1903).","Since the arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Hawai’i’s forest birds have undergone tremendous losses and face a panoply of threats.

The exact causes of these declines are unknown, but a myriad of plausible threats have been identified including habitat loss and degradation, disturbance and hunting.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It departs its breeding grounds from late-July to September (southward movements continuing into November) and returns from late-May to June (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It breeds from May to August in solitary well-dispersed pairs and forages alone or in small loose flocks of up to 30 individuals (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). It is gregarious during the winter however, often roosting in large flocks containing up to several thousand individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding The species nests in the high Arctic in both upland and valley locations between the treeline and the coast, utilising dry stony tundra with sedge, moss, lichen, grass or dwarf birch, peat ridges in tundra marshes, dry exposed ridges, riverbanks, raised sand or gravel beaches, and rocky slopes (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species frequents intertidal mudflats, saltmarshes, sandflats and beaches of oceanic coastlines, bays and estuaries (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). During migration it may also be found inland on lakes, pools or grasslands (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Breeding During the breeding season the diet of this species consists largely of adult and larval insects such as beetles and Diptera as well as some plant matter (e.g. grass seeds and stems) (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding When on the coast in its wintering range the species takes marine polychaete worms, molluscs and crustaceans (e.g. crabs, sand shrimps), occasionally also taking insects (e.g. grasshoppers and beetles) or earthworms when in inland habitats on passage (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow scrape on dry ground in exposed, stony sites, neighbouring nests not less than 400 m apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Management information In the UK there is evidence that the removal of Common Cordgrass (Spartina anglica) from tidal mudflats using a herbicide is beneficial for the species (Evans 1986).","Numerous threats have been identified, but the extent to which any of them are driving observed declines is unknown, with much more research needed before threats can be targeted for mitigation.Climate change has been identified for several shorebird species as a threat that is driving reduced breeding productivity by a number of mechanisms (e.g. Meltofte et al. 2007, Eikelenboom 2016, Kubelka et al. 2018); more research for this species specifically is needed. Available breeding habitat based on predicted distribution under future climate change scenarios is predicted to reduce by between 82% (RCP 4.5) and 87% (RCP 8.5) by 2070 (Wauchope et al. 2017).The species is exposed to additional threats on its staging and wintering grounds, particularly habitat degradation and conversion. At Barr Al Hikman, Oman, where up to 5% of the Asian-East African Flyway population has been reported to overwinter, planned urban developments, the aquaculture (for shrimp) industry, oil refineries and disturbance from fishing industries and falcon hunting were all identified as threats by de Fouw et al. (2018) and these almost certainly apply to other important staging and wintering sites in the broader region. The extent of hunting in this region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet et al. 2016). The species is threatened on the south-east coast of India (Point Calimere) by illegal hunting (bird trapping), reservoir and marshland habitat alteration by salt-industries, and habitat degradation by diminishing rainfall (changing the salt regime) (Balachandran 2006). Rapid land-use change and loss of mudflats are also major threats here. It is also threatened at Walvis Bay in Namibia, a key wetland site in southern Africa, by habitat degradation (e.g. changes in the flood regime due to road building, and wetland reclamation for suburb and port development), and disturbance from tourism (Wearne and Underhill 2005). Again, these threats are probably widespread in the region.Significant numbers of P. squatarola migrate down the Yellow and East China Seas where habitat loss and hunting are plausibly significant threats. The extent of reclaimed land along the Yellow Sea coastline now exceeds the extent of remaining intertidal mudflat (Murray et al. 2014, IUCN 2023), suggesting that this may have contributed greatly to declines in this species. The rate of habitat lost to land reclamation has slowed since a peak in c. 2013, in particular in recent years due to the promised near-ceasing of land reclamation in China in early 2018 (Melville 2018); however, recent satellite data suggests that the extent of intertidal mudflat has continued to decrease, in large part due to continued reclamations in the Korean Peninsula (IUCN 2023). Mudflats have also continued to degrade in suitability for this species and other shorebirds because of the invasive alien Spartina alterniflora cordgrass, which appears to be spreading; in recent (post 2020) years, this threat has probably driven greater declines than planned land reclamation. In addition to land reclamation, coastal development and a rapid increase in the human population along the coastline of the Yellow Sea has led to widespread degradation of mudflats and coastal habitats used by this species; IUCN (2023) (and references therein) cite the following as additional drivers of mudflat loss and degradation: 'processes such as changes in sediment supply, loss of coastal vegetation associated with development...erosion, redistribution of sediments due to storms, and compaction and subsidence (sinking) caused by subsurface resource and groundwater extraction are also likely to be factors'. Offshore windfarms may have a so far unquantified impact on birds due to collisions (unlikely) and displacement and disturbance of feeding birds (more likely). Disturbance on mudflats by fishermen and others using the mudflats may also be reasonably considered a threat. Hunting is also possibly a significant threat impacting this and other shorebird species on passage (Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020).In the Americas threats are not well understood, but Smith et al. (2023) likewise cite urban and wetland development as well as disturbance as likely key threats. The extent to which hunting is a threat in the Americas is largely unknown. There is subsistence level harvest of the species in Alaska; totalled numbers for this species combined with golden plovers is low (Naves et al. 2019) and there is no possibility this represents a significant threat to the species. Less clear, however, is the impact of more widespread hunting; e.g. Andres et al. (2022) found the species in 44.4% of markets in Guyana, and AFSI (2020) reported low levels of hunting in northern South America and the Caribbean.","Spans all major flyways with a vast breeding range that covers much of Arctic Russia and the Nearctic.Breeding populations in western Siberia winter in Western Europe and West Africa where estimated to number c.200,000 (von Roomen et al. 2014, Nagy and Langendoen 2020). Numbers wintering in south-west Asia and eastern Africa less certain, but suspected to be c.90,000 (Wetlands International 2012). An additional 30,000 suspected to winter in South Asia (Wetlands International 2012). Numbers in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway estimated at c.80,000 in 2016 (Hansen et al. 2023). The total number breeding in Siberia is therefore estimated to be c.240,000-280,000, assuming not all of the estimates discussed previously, which are made from non-breeding areas, refer to mature individuals (which are assumed to make up 60-70% of the population).Larger numbers breed in the Nearctic. Andres et al. (2012) previously estimated 262,700 across Alaska and Arctic Canada, however this noted that the estimate would increase as the PRISM surveys were incomplete. A draft status review of shorebirds reports a final PRISM estimate of at least 1 million birds, based on c.725,000 (353,000-1,100,000) in Arctic Canada (Bart et al. in prep.) and an additional c.260,000 from Alaska, but the latter covers only a proportion of the species' Alaskan breeding range, and the number in Alaska may be closer to that from Arctic Canada. Accordingly, the number of birds in the Nearctic is estimated at c.1,000,000-2,000,000, most of which are probably mature individuals given they are from breeding season surveys.Combining estimates yields a total population of c.1,250,000-2,250,000 mature individuals. The total population estimate used here is a broader bracket of 1,000,000-2,500,000 mature individuals, acknowledging that there are several elements of uncertainty, including the extent to which populations have declined since population estimates were made, and the possibility that the Siberian population may be underestimated.",Decreasing,"Breeds in Arctic Russia from the Kanin Peninsula to Chukotskiy and Anadyrskaya, and Alaska, USA, to Melville Peninsula and Baffin Island (Canada). Birds winter widely on coastlines of North and South America, Europe, Africa, South Asia, South-East Asia and Australasia, with birds occurring in virtually every country when on migration.","Hunting is a probable threat to this species in parts of its range, as the hunting of shorebirds across the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is not uncommon (see, e.g., Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020, Yong et al. 2022). The extent of hunting in the Arabian Peninsula region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet et al. 2016). The extent of hunting in the Americas flyway (chiefly in Latin and South America) is not well quantified, but there is evidence that birds are harvested in Guyana (Andres et al. 2022) and probably elsewhere in the Caribbean. There is subsistence level harvest of the species in Alaska; totalled numbers for this species combined with golden plovers is low (Naves et al. 2019) and there is no possibility this represents a significant threat to the species.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThis species is covered by the general protection regime provided by Article 1 of the European Union (EU) Birds Directive to all naturally occurring wild species in the EU, although it is also listed on Annex II/B of the Directive as a species that may be hunted in several EU Member States. It is also listed on Annex III (protected) of the pan-European Bern Convention, Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and Annex II of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). Across the EU, 370 Natura 2000 sites have been designated for the conservation of this species on passage and in winter (EEA 2024). Some habitats along flyway routes are protected. The Australasian Wader Studies Group, along with BirdLife Australia's Shorebirds 2020 Project and committed volunteers continue to monitor migratory shorebirds within the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (Vine and Maurer 2016). China is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to clear tidal mudflats of Spartina cordgrass, with the aim of eliminating 90% of it by 2025; locally, this has already been successful, for example at Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve (Stokstad 2023). The governments of China and South Korea have halted new projects that require or depend upon land reclamation, and across the Korean Peninsula the number of coastal wetlands has increased; moreover in China and South Korea, key areas for migratory shorebirds (including P. squatarola) have been identified and prioritised by government and two World Heritage nominations have been made on these grounds (IUCN 2023). Although data on scale or impact are sparse, IUCN (2023) consider that ""support for coastal wetland conservation and wise-use appears to have increased over the last decade"". There has been a substantial increase in the number of volunteer groups and NGOs helping to monitor the migrations of shorebirds and other waterbirds, as well as increased media coverage and special events, demonstrating enhanced awareness among coastal communities (see also EAAFP 2016). North Korea became a Party to the Ramsar Convention and joined the EAAF Partnership in 2018. In 2021, the 'Regional Flyway Initiative' (RFI) was set up by the Asian Development Bank, with technical support from BirdLife International, with the aim of protecting and restoring priority wetland ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide in the East-Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), the most threatened flyway globally. The Initiative is slated for implementation in 10 East, South and South-East Asian countries: Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, all of which are used by P. squatarola on northbound and southbound migrations between breeding and wintering areas, and many also for wintering. The RFI will mobilise large-scale financing to support the protection, sustainable management and restoration of at least 50 priority wetlands across ten Asian countries, with an initial financing commitment of $3 billion from the ADB (BirdLife International 2022). Over time, the RFI aims to enhance and expand the existing efforts in conserving and managing priority wetlands identified on the basis of supporting globally significant congregations of migratory waterbirds, and leverage on collaborative opportunities with stakeholders including national governments, civil society organisations, communities, regional organisations like the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership.Conservation Actions ProposedEnsure population monitoring continues throughout and its range, and preferably expand it to other regions (particularly in East Asia and wintering grounds in Africa where data coverage is currently patchy). In the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, the main action needed for this is the amelioration of threats on its migration. China needs to implement its plan to eliminate 90+% of Spartina cordgrass to prevent further loss of feeding habitat (much has already been lost to land reclamation; IUCN 2023). The discharge of toxic pollutants into coastal wetlands (especially where there are large shorebird congregations) needs to be controlled. Further degradation of mudflats needs to be stopped, including monitoring and preventing detrimental release of riverine sediments and responsible planning of offshore windfarms. Tools are available, such as AviStep (https://avistep.birdlife.org/) to ensure sustainable building of renewable energy infrastructure. Many of these threats, particularly development of coastal wetlands, apply also to the Arabian Peninsula where there is a need for sensible policy-making and implementation to reduce illegal killing and habitat loss (Brochet et al. 2016, de Fouw et al. 2018). There is an urgent need to understand the threat posed by hunting across its range, particularly in the Americas, Africa and the Middle East, where there is a lack of even descriptive understanding on the extent to which this occurs.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
254411509,22693740,Pluvialis dominica,Least Concern,,2024,2024-07-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species has an extremely large range and large population size. Despite the fact that the population is suspected to have declined recently, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach threatened thresholds. The impact of hunting at key stopover sites during southbound migration may be driving slow declines, possibly in combination with loss of optimal non-breeding and northbound migration habitat, and the potential future impact of climate change on breeding habitat should be assessed though large-scale repeated population monitoring. The species is evaluated as Least Concern.","","Demographic studies indicate survival is the key determinant of population trend for the species (Weiser et al. 2020).  Loss of non-breeding and stopover habitat due to conversion of grasslands to agricultural use that is less favourable to the species is suspected to be a major cause of increased mortality, and direct mortality through market hunting at moderately high levels in parts of the Caribbean (AFSI 2020) may be sufficient to cause some declines. Shifting and alteration of habitat due to climate change is also suspected to be affecting reproductive success but is not considered to be causing elevated mortality rates, hence other drivers are likely responsible for any ongoing population reduction.","The global population has been estimated at 6 million birds (Bart et al. in prep.), here placed in a band of 1,000,000-6,000,000 mature individuals. This value is based on an extrapolation from the final estimate from the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) surveys on the breeding grounds (Bart and Smith 2012, Smith et al. in prep.). The final estimate for Arctic Canada was 3,310,745 individuals (Smith et al. in prep.), with an additional c. 300,000 individuals for surveyed parts of northern Alaska (Andres et al. 2012). This surveyed area comprises roughly 60% of the breeding range, hence the final extrapolated estimate of 6 million birds (Bart et al. in prep.). These surveys target breeding pairs in suitable breeding habitat, hence the values derived are considered to relate to mature individuals. It has been noted that extrapolations based on habitat association may be misleading for this species as what appears suitable habitat may contain no birds (Johnson et al. 2021). Hence the extrapolated value here is also treated as a maximum.Previously the population was estimated to number only c.500,000 individuals (Andres et al. 2012), but this was a value based on only the initial surveys and it was stated that this estimate would increase as the PRISM surveys were completed (Smith et al. in prep). Earlier the suggestion that the population could be 1.0 to 2.5 million pairs (Byrkjedal and Thompson 1998) was considered highly unlikely (Clay et al. 2010). Numbers in non-breeding areas suggest a large proportion of this very large breeding population are unaccounted for by surveys to date. Densities in the grazed pampas in Argentina are reported at 10+ birds per square kilometre (Johnson et al. 2021), which if applied to the whole area of suitable habitat would suggest more than a million individuals are present in this region. A recent approach generating population estimates using Bayesian models on simultaneous large-scale samples along the Atlantic coast between Brazil and Argentina reported a total of 36,038 (95% CI 14,365 to 57,653) individuals (Faria et al. in press), but these surveys did not cover non-coastal sites where most of this species’ population occurs. Large numbers are now thought to winter further north following deforestation increasing the area of suitable habitat, at least in Brazil (Sick 1997), and in native wet pastures in the Brazilian Pantanal it is one of the most numerous Nearctic migrants (A.P. Nunes in litt. 2024).",Decreasing,"The species breeds in the low arctic and subarctic tundra in northern Canada and Alaska (United States of America) (Johnson et al. 2021). It undertakes a long-distance migration to non-breeding areas in grassland and wetlands in interior South America, especially in northern Argentina, but also in Uruguay and southernmost coastal Brazil, and at high-elevation in Bolivia and Peru (Fink et al. 2023). Many also winter patchily along the Pacific coast from Chile to northern Peru and northern Brazil, Guyana, Venezuela and in small numbers in the Caribbean (Johnson et al. 2021, Fink et al. 2023). During spring passage most pass through the centre of the USA from Louisiana and Texas to North Dakota and Saskatchwan, while the majority undertake an initial long-distance post-breeding migration hop direct from north-east Canada to the Caribbean over the Atlantic. Consequently Caribbean islands are of considerable importance during the southbound migration. It has been widely recorded as a vagrant (Johnson et al. 2021, Fink et al. 2023).","Reports of considerable hunting take in the Caribbean and parts of the northern South American coast at migration sites may represent a severe threat. An estimated Potential Biological Removal has been set at 17,500 (Watts et al. 2015). Current levels of offtake are not systematically monitored but are high on at least some islands, with 600-1,800 taken annually from Barbados (Watts et al. 2015). When large numbers are grounded on certain islands by tropical storms harvest may exceed sustainable offtake levels: 2,000 were reported killed in a single field in Guadaloupe following the passage of Tropical Storm Maria in 2011 (Watts et al. 2015). However harvest effort and numbers taken appear to be reducing on several Caribbean islands (AFSI 2020).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

However the species is exposed to a panoply of threats across its vast range, including habitat loss and degradation, illegal killing, disturbance and possibly reduced breeding productivity caused by factors associated with climate change. While the relative importance of these threats is unknown, monitoring data in several parts of its world—particularly in North America—indicate locally rapid declines over the past three generations. Combining often disparate trend data from across its range and weighting it according to likely regional population sizes, the global population is thought to have declined moderately rapidly, at a rate of c. 20-29% over the past three generations (18 years). It is therefore listed as Near Threatened.","Behaviour This species is fully migratory (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It breeds from May to early-August in solitary pairs, although several pairs may nest close together in optimal habitats along coasts or on islands (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species migrates in large flocks and is gregarious and sociable when feeding or roosting in winter, often foraging in close flocks of 10-100 or more individuals, especially in tidal areas (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Habitat Breeding The species breeds near the coast or up to several kilometres inland in the high Arctic, nesting on coastal plains, marshes and tundra and showing a preference for mosaics of bare rock, clay or shingle and vegetation near water or in areas that remain damp until late summer (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species is mainly coastal, although on migration it may occur inland along dykes or on lake shores (del Hoyo et al. 1996). During the winter it frequents productive rocky and shingle shores, breakwaters, sandy beaches with storm-wracked seaweed, short-grass saltmarshes, sheltered inlets, estuaries, mangroves swamps, exposed reefs and mudflats with beds of molluscs (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Breeding On its Arctic breeding grounds the species takes Diptera (especially adult and larval midges) as well as larval Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, Coleoptera and spiders, occasionally also taking vegetable matter early in the season (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season its diet consists of insects, crustaceans, molluscs (especially mussels or cockles), annelids, echinoderms, small fish, carrion and birds eggs (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression in mud, peat or on dry ground with dense vegetation, often positioned on a slight ridge, hummock or tussock, or in cleft or shallow fissure (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species usually nests solitarily, although neighbouring pairs may nest as little as 15 m apart along coasts or on islands (where abundant feeding habitats are available) (Snow and Perrins 1998).","Numerous threats have been identified, but the extent to which any of them are driving observed declines is unknown, with much more research needed before threats can be targeted for mitigation.Climate change has been identified for several shorebird species as a threat that is driving reduced breeding productivity by a number of mechanisms (e.g. Meltofte et al. 2007, Eikelenboom 2016, Kubelka et al. 2018); more research for this species specifically is needed.The species is exposed to additional threats on its staging and wintering grounds, particularly habitat degradation and conversion.

The Initiative is slated for implementation in 10 East, South and South-East Asian countries: Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, all of which are used by A. interpres on northbound and southbound migrations between breeding and wintering areas, and many also for wintering. The RFI will mobilise large-scale financing to support the protection, sustainable management and restoration of at least 50 priority wetlands across ten Asian countries, with an initial financing commitment of $3 billion from the ADB (BirdLife International 2022). Over time, the RFI aims to enhance and expand the existing efforts in conserving and managing priority wetlands identified on the basis of supporting globally significant congregations of migratory waterbirds, and leverage on collaborative opportunities with stakeholders including national governments, civil society organizations, communities, regional organisations like the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership. A large portion of this species' breeding population is covered by PRISM surveys in North America, enabling regular monitoring.Conservation Actions ProposedEnsure population monitoring continues throughout and its range, and preferably expand it to other regions (particularly in East Asia and wintering grounds in Africa where data coverage is currently patchy). In the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, the main action needed for this is the amelioration of threats on its migration. China needs to implement its plan to eliminate 90+% of Spartina cordgrass to prevent further loss of feeding habitat (much has already been lost to land reclamation; IUCN 2023). The discharge of toxic pollutants into coastal wetlands (especially where there are large shorebird congregations) needs to be controlled. Further degradation of mudflats needs to be stopped, including monitoring and preventing detrimental release of riverine sediments and responsible planning of offshore windfarms. Tools are available, such as AviStep (https://avistep.birdlife.org/) to ensure sustainable building of renewable energy infrastructure. Many of these threats, particularly development of coastal wetlands, apply also to the Arabian Peninsula where there is a need for sensible policy-making and implementation to reduce illegal killing and habitat loss (Brochet et al. 2016, de Fouw et al. 2018).",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This reduction is estimated from migration count data, believed to represent a significant proportion of the global population and reflect a genuine ongoing decline in the number of mature individuals.The main drivers of the decline are uncertain, though the impact of habitat alteration caused by climate change on tundra breeding species are likely to impact this species along with loss of non-breeding habitat in South America. Changes to conditions at stopover sites may also be important. Actions to protect and restore wet habitat in the non-breeding range and retain and expand undisturbed areas at key stopover locations would likely mitigate some of the recorded reduction, but more direct research into this and other shorebirds' responses to threats across the full seasonal range is required.","Stilt Sandpiper breeds in wet tundra, often with emergent vegetation but may nest on slightly drier slopes (Klima and Jehl, Jr. 2020). Favours ponds for foraging year round, usually in freshwater areas (including flooded agricultural fields) but in non-breeding and passage areas also salt evaporation ponds and brackish lagoons (Klima and Jehl, Jr. 2020).The loss of wetland area in the south east South American grasslands (Miñarro and Bilenca 2008, Brandolin et al. 2013, Piquer-Rodriguez et al. 2018), a key non-breeding area (Fink et al. 2023) is inferred to be causing an ongoing decline in the area and quality of habitat. Impacts from habitat shifts due to climate change on the species' tundra breeding range (Galbraith et al. 2014, Wauchope et al. 2017, Anderson et al. 2023) have also been projected to cause declines in this species and may already be affecting habitat quality.","As a long-distance migrant Stilt Sandpipers are exposed to a variety of threats during their annual cycle, but determining those likely to be driving population reduction is difficult. Impacts from habitat shifts due to climate change on the species' tundra breeding range (Galbraith et al. 2014, Wauchope et al. 2017, Anderson et al. 2023) appear likely to cause declines in this species, but it is unclear if the effects would already be apparent. Anderson et al. (2023) recorded the species apparently moving into the studied area during the period of study, noting that the species was associated with warmer temperatures than other species present, while Galbraith et al. (2014) determined there would be an increased risk of extinction due to loss of breeding habitat under future climate change. Wauchope et al. (2017) used distribution modelling to predict almost zero climatically suitable habitat for the species by 2070 under the RCP 4.5 or RCP 8.5, consistent with the observation of current rapid shifts in occupied area and future loss of breeding habitat, but none of these studies indicated that loss had already occurred that would account for reductions already recorded. Potentially climate change may affect non-breeding and migratory stop over sites as well, but impacts on the breeding habitat appear likely to become most significant in time.The biggest change within the species' habitat has been the rapid loss and degradation of wetlands in the south-east South American grasslands due to conversion to agriculture, principally annual crops such as soy beans (Miñarro and Bilenca 2008). This area is a key non-breeding site for the species (Fink et al. 2023) and it is likely that the majority of the population visit this area annually. In south east Córdoba province, Argentina approximately 40% of wetland habitat was lost in 20 years to 2007 following canalisation that acted as a trigger for rapid conversion to agriculture (Brandolin et al. 2013), while a pattern of intensification of use appears to be driving conversion of pasture to cropland in the Pampas (Piquer-Rodriguez et al. 2018). Potentially these changes may have impacts on both the amount of habitat available and on prey abundance, hence quality of habitat. Research is needed into the impacts of these habitat changes on the species, and others reliant on these wetlands. Market hunting of the species was recorded to have caused large population reductions in the 19th century but the practice continues to some extent, predominately during the post-breeding migration in the Caribbean and northern South America (AFSI 2020). The species was assigned a moderately high (score 3 out of 4) index of harvest for the Caribbean (AFSI 2020) but the level of harvest has not been quantified further. None were recorded in markets in Guyana and few (&lt;0.1%) were observed in surveys recording an annual mean of 101,500 individual shorebirds (Andres et al. 2022), but large numbers (10,000-50,000) have been reported during migration in Suriname (Klima and Jehl, Jr. 2020), where the largest shorebird harvest is currently believed to be occurring (AFSI 2020).Native predators, notably Red Fox Vulpes vulpes, have expanded their range through use of human subsidies from settlements, which have also moved north (Gallant et al. 2019) and are now more abundant within the breeding range of a range of tundra breeding waders (Bart et al. in prep.). It is suspected that rates of nest predation and potentially rates of adult mortality during breeding have increased as a result, but there is no evidence of this as yet.","The population has been estimated at 1.2 million mature individuals (Andres et al. 2012, Bart et al. in prep.). This value is based on the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) surveys on the breeding grounds (Bart and Smith 2012, Smith et al. in prep.). The final estimate for Arctic Canada was 1,108,326 (Smith et al. in prep.), with an additional c.124,000 for surveyed parts of northern Alaska (Andres et al. 2012), totaling 1,232,326 and rounded to 1.2 million (Bart et al. in prep.). These surveys target breeding pairs in suitable breeding habitat, hence the values derived are considered to relate to mature individuals.",Decreasing,"The species breeds in the low arctic and subarctic tundra in northern Canada and Alaska (United States of America). It undertakes a long-distance migration to non-breeding areas primarily in wet habitats in interior South America, especially in northern Argentina, but also in Uruguay and southernmost coastal Brazil, and at high-elevation in Bolivia and Peru. Many also winter patchily along the Pacific coast from central Peru north to Sinaloa (Mexico), around the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico with some also remaining at the Salton Sea. On passage most pass through the centre of the USA from Louisiana and Texas to North Dakota and Saskatchwan with relatively few recorded on either coast (Klima and Jehl, Jr. 2020).","Included as one of the species at risk from hunting in the Caribbean Islands and considered to be subject to a moderately high index of harvest (AFSI 2020). Few occur on the coast of Guyana or Suriname, where levels of harvest are high hence risk to the species there is low (AFSI 2020, Andres et al. 2022).

Hunting is illegal in many countries within the species range, though there is allowance for subsistence hunting in Brazil and for indigenous people in Canada and the USA (AFSI 2020).Stilt Sandpiper is monitored via the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) (Ziolkowski Jr. et al. 2022) although this covers only a small proportion of the breeding range; by the Christmas Bird Count (Meehan et al. 2022) which does not cover the main wintering areas; by the International Shorebird Survey during migration (Brown et al. 2001, Smith et al. 2023); and partly covered by the International Waterbird Census during the non-breeding season (Wetlands International 2023).Conservation Actions NeededKnowledge of the species' abundance and trends during the non-breeding season is low, and coordinated surveys in non-breeding areas are required. Consequently the effects of land-use change in non-breeding areas on the species' population and individual survival and body condition are not understood, making the identification of key threats to the species problematic. Hunting may be a significant threat, but quantification of the current rate of harvest is needed across a wider area than so far reported through the AFSI (2020).

The species feeds primarily on horseshoe crab eggs during episodes of rapid mass accumulation, but harvest pressure from 1995-2005 dramatically reduced egg availability (Mizrahi et al. 2012).

Rates of reduction could well exceed 30% over three generations and accordingly the species is assessed as Vulnerable. At present the drivers of such declines are uncertain, although the loss of and disturbance to key non-breeding and stopover sites is suspected to impact populations and climate change driven habitat shifts may be causing prey mismatches that affect reproductive output, as well as altering fine-scale habitat suitability.","Hudsonian Godwit breeds on marshy tundra close to the treeline in Alaska and Canada. During their migration and over winter in South America, the species occupies mudflats, shallow marshes, tidal pools, shallow freshwater lakes and flooded fields (Van Gils et al. 2019). Variation in survival rates over the annual cycle indicate lowest survival during breeding and southbound migration, but that breeding condition is affected by site quality in the non-breeding season (Swift et al. 2020).","A number of threats have been identified that may be impacting the population but no clear driver of declines is evident. Climate change impacts may affect the availability or productivity of non-breeding or stopover habitat throughout the range (COSEWIC 2019), but no direct link to the species is evident. However, the species breeding habitat in the sub-Arctic and boreal regions is being affected by climate change and the amount of precisely suitable habitat is predicted to decline (Swift et al. 2017), as already noted for Whimbrel N. phaeopus through the advancement of scrub and trees (Ballantyne and Nol 2015) and projected for other arctic breeding waders (Wauchope et al. 2016). In addition there is evidence of climate variability causing a significant phenological mismatch between breeding and peak prey availability in some parts of the breeding range (Senner et al. 2017, Wilde et al. 2022). Chick survival was lower when invertebrate prey (especially larger items needed by larger chicks) was scarcer, but notably years with especially severe mismatches may pass tipping points in the species' ability to adapt: productivity in the study area was almost zero in 2014 and 2015 where the mismatch was particularly large (Wilde et al. 2022). Habitat is also being lost to direct conversion and degradation from a variety of sources. Natural wetlands in the Great Plains, key migratory stopover areas for the species, have been extensively converted to agriculture, although recent and ongoing changes are thought minimal (COSEWIC 2019), but there remain plausible ongoing impacts from nutrient enrichment of wetlands, especially from cattle (A.P. Nunes in litt. 2024). Overgrazing by greatly increased populations of Canada Goose Branta canadensis and Snow Goose Anser caerulescens have created large bare areas in breeding habitat that are avoided by Hudsonian Godwits, but there is no evidence this has affected breeding density (Swift et al. 2017). There is concern that a large expansion of offshore wind turbines in Bahia Lomas and Tierra del Fuego may cause displacement or collision mortality (Norambuena et al. 2022a). Infrastructure associated with oil extraction in the vicinity of Bahia Lomas pose a risk of oil spills (Espoz et al. 2022), and the proximity of major shipping routes there and in Tierra del Fuego poses the risk that a major oil spill could affect a large number of individuals (Senner 2010), but population impacts of oil contamination have not been demonstrated in the species. On Isla Chiloé (Chile) salmon farms, peat mining and seaweed collection threaten the foraging grounds (Senner 2010), Anon. 2015) but their most severe impact may be via physical disturbance of foraging and roosting flocks (Senner 2008). Human disturbance may also affect stopover sites that are popular tourist beaches (Senner 2010). Disturbance by dogs is also thought notable in this area and around Rio Grande, Argentina (COSEWIC 2019). Close to Churchill, Manitoba, Common Raven have become established through reliance on human resources but predate nests in the region to a level that may suppress reproductive output here (COSEWIC 2019). Historically hunting was considered the main driver of significant population declines during the 19th Century (Walker et al. 2024). The species is now protected in Canada and the USA. In investigations of shorebird hunting in the Caribbean and northern South America this species is rarely mentioned and it is not one of the main target species (e.g. AFSI Harvest Working Group 2017, Andres et al. 2022), but a potential biological removal value was generated by Watts et al. (2015) of 1,945 ± 573. On Martinique bag limits for the species of 15 birds for the season have applied (AFSI 2020), but any killing of the species was outlawed on 4th October 2021 (Anon. 2021). An unknown but likely small number are likely to still be taken in the Caribbean each autumn. There is still a level of traditional subsistence harvest by the James Bay Cree during migration, but this is thought unlikely to be at significant levels (COSEWIC 2019); it is not a target of subsistence harvest in Alaska (Naves et al. 2019) but may be rarely taken if mistaken for Bar-tailed Godwit L. lapponica (Senner 2010).","The population size is estimated to be 41,000 to 70,000 mature individuals.Simultaneous surveys of the Atlantic portion of the non-breeding range in January 2019 recorded a mean total of 56,276 (9,326-113,221) individuals, using two step ‘hurdle’ generalised linear models to predict abundance in different habitat classes (Faria et al. in press). The wide confidence intervals are a cause for caution in using this value and the total number of individuals observed in the production of this estimate is only 1,317 (Faria et al. in press), in contrast to the 45,500 individuals counted during aerial surveys in the 1980s (Morrison and Ross 1989). These caveats aside, it is a considerable simultaneous effort to sample the non-breeding range that hosts more than 70% of the population. To account for the large uncertainty in this data this assessment uses the second quartile range of values (25-50%) as a precautionary position. This is considered necessary especially in light of data indicating extremely rapid declines in monitored migration sites in North America (Smith et al. 2023). The lower bound of the second quartile is 28,959 individuals, hence a cautious range is given for this estimate of 29,000-56,300 individuals. Faria et al. (in press) did not estimate numbers for Chilean sites, hence it appears the birds occurring at Bahia Lomas in Chile (Morrison unpublished data, in COSEWIC 2019, Morrison and Ross 1989) are not included in these counts. Hence the c. 18,000 individuals counted at this site in 2018 (Morrison unpublished data, in COSEWIC 2019) need adding to this estimate, increasing it to 47,000-74,300 individuals. There have been subsequent aerial counts of the Bahia Lomas non-breeding population: 20.423 ± 639 individuals in January 2022 (Norambuena et al. 2022b) and 24,038 ± 148 individuals in January 2023 (Norambuena et al. 2023): but the proximity of the site to those covered by Faria et al. (in press) suggests that the precautionary position is to use the values closest in time in case of interannual dispersal between non-breeding sites.Almost all the remaining non-breeding birds occur around Chiloe Island on the Pacific coast of Chile (Morrison and Ross 1989, Espinosa et al. 2005, Andres et al. 2009, García Walther 2016, Fink et al. 2023, Walker et al. 2024). This has most recently been estimated at 18,640 individuals (excluding potentially inflationary extrapolation to non-surveyed sites) from surveys in 2014 (García Walther 2016). This latter total is comparable in method to the 20,961 individuals reported by Andres et al. (2009) for 2007-8, and the 21,282 individuals in 1997 (Espinosa et al. 2005).Summing the most recent values for the two regions gives a range of 65,599 – 92,916 individuals, rounded to 65,600-93,000 for the region that hosts nearly all non-breeding birds. While small numbers are present further north as far as Piura, Peru (Senner 2008, Fink et al. 2023), these are not thought to add significantly to this estimate.The median value is very similar to the 77,000 individuals given by Andres et al. (2012), which was based on an earlier estimate of 56,000 individuals for the Tierra del Fuego (and Samborombon Bay) non-breeding population (Morrison et al. 2006) plus 21,000 individuals for the Chiloe population (Andres et al. 2009).These estimates, all based on non-breeding counts, include immature birds. Assuming these represent between one quarter (COSEWIC 2019) and one third of the counted individuals then the population size falls between 43,000 and 70,000 mature individuals.Much of the above data was used in the COSIEWIC assessment of Hudsonian Godwit in 2019 (COSEWIC 2019), which gave a revised population estimate of 41,000 mature individuals. This differed in using a lower estimate for the Tierra del Fuego wintering population of 32,400 ± 5,900 based on the average count over 2011-2018 (Morrison unpublished data, in COSEWIC 2019) plus a separate estimate for Samborombon Bay in Argentina of 1,070 ± 290 individuals (Martínez-Curci and Isacch 2017). Averaged count values can be underestimates for a target species that can switch sites between years, often leading to apparent large fluctuations in numbers at small geographic scales: this was noted for counts in the Chiloe region by Espinosa et al. (2005). But this lower value (based on count data rather than modelled abundance) is comparable with the lower quartile value used as a precautionary bound above. The counter suggestion is that a modelling method can perform poorly for species that aggregate in large flocks, hence occur only patchily across apparently suitable habitat. This is certainly the case for this species. Given that the estimate falls so close to the lower bound of that derived from the above approach, this estimate is accepted as the lower bound of the population size.A separate population estimate of 70,710 ± 30,385 individuals was derived from 2002-2003 spring migration counts in the U.S. Prairie Pothole region (Skagen et al. 2008). It is assumed that almost all godwits heading to the breeding grounds (a proportion remain in non-breeding areas [Navedo and Ruiz 2020]) are mature individuals. It is notable that this value is comparable to that derived from the non-breeding data. The value of 7 days for stopover duration used was a generic value based on a small number of observations relating to other species of shorebird (Skagen et al. 2008). Morrison et al. (2006) considered a conservative approach assuming the true value lies within 1 SE below the mean, which gives an estimate from this data of 40,300-70,700 mature individuals.This is a wholly migratory species for which there do not appear to be any barriers to dispersal, and there is no known variation in morphology. Despite this, significant genetic divergence was reported between the Hudson Bay and Mackenzie Delta breeding individuals, though based on a sample of only 20 individuals (Haig et al. 1997). It appears there is also some evidence of migratory connectivity of Alaskan breeding birds and wintering areas on the Pacific coast of Chile, and separately the remaining breeding population wintering on the Atlantic coast and Tierra del Fuego (Senner 2010). However, tracking data has shown that individuals may move between these areas prior to northbound migration (COSEWIC 2019, Walker et al. 2024) and it is considered most likely that there is regular individual dispersal between different breeding areas. If the Alaska/Pacific population is a separate subpopulation, the current estimate of the population size is 12,300 mature individuals (García Walther 2016), which would be 30% of the minimum population size.",Decreasing,"The species breeds in the subarctic and boreal regions in northern Canada and Alaska (United States of America) (Walker et al. 2024). It undertakes a long-distance migration to non-breeding areas primarily in Argentina and Chile, with small numbers along the Atlantic coast in Uruguay and Brazil and the Pacific coast to northern Peru (Fink et al. 2023, Walker et al. 2024). On northbound passage most pass through the centre of the USA from Louisiana and Texas to North Dakota and Saskatchwan (Fink et al. 2023, Walker et al. 2024).","Historically hunting was considered the main driver of significant population declines during the 19th Century (Walker et al. 2024).

A conservation action plan for Isla Chiloé was completed in 2010 with this as one of the focal species (Delgado et al. 2010). Conservation Actions ProposedContinue research into the migration routes and staging sites of Hudsonian Godwit.

There is considerable uncertainty in the rate of the reduction, but it is suspected to fall between 20-29% over the past three generations and for the period projected to the near future. At present, the population size and range remain large. Due to the rate of population reduction, the species is assessed as Near Threatened.","Behaviour This species is a fully migratory circumpolar breeder with several sub-populations that employ a number of migration strategies, from short coastal flights to long, non-stop flights overland on a broad front (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The sub-population that breeds in north-east Greenland migrates through Iceland, Britain and western France to arrive in its West African wintering grounds (specifically Banc d'Arguin in Mauritania) from late-July, returning again between March and early-April (del Hoyo et al. 1996). European birds may gather in large congregations from the beginning of July in areas such as the Wadden Sea or the Wash to moult (del Hoyo et al. 1996), and some juveniles may remain in the non-breeding range all year (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species breeds dispersed or aggregated in loose colonies, and travels in group sizes of up to 1,500 on passage, remaining in large groups (up to hundreds of thousands of birds) throughout the non-breeding season (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species is active both diurnally and nocturnally (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo et al. 1996, Shepherd and Lank 2004). Habitat Breeding In the breeding season this species frequents moist boggy ground interspersed with surface water, such as tussock tundra and peat-hummock tundra in the arctic, as well as wet coastal grasslands, salt marshes and wet upland moorland (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding In the non-breeding season this species mainly prefer estuarine mudflats, but also frequent a wide variety of freshwater and brackish wetlands (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo et al. 1996), both coastal and inland, including lagoons, muddy freshwater shores, tidal rivers, flooded fields, sewage farms, salt-works, sandy coasts (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo et al. 1996), lakes and dams (Hockey et al. 2005). For roosting during high tides and at night this species prefers large fields of naturally fertilised short pasture or soil-based crops with few vertical structures that could be used by predators (Shepherd and Lank 2004). Diet Breeding This species is omnivorous during the breeding season, consuming mostly adult and larval insects (dipteran flies, beetles, caddisflies, wasps, sawflies and mayflies), and also spiders, mites, earthworms, snails, slugs and plant matter (usually seeds) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding It is also omnivorous during the non-breeding season, consuming mostly polychaete worms and small gastropods, as well as insects (dipteran flies and beetles), crustaceans, bivalves, plant matter and occasionally small fish (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site Its nest is a scrape or shallow depression in the ground, concealed in vegetation and sometimes in a tuft or tussock (and thus raised slightly off the ground) (Cramp and Simmons 1977, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Management information The provision of well-surfaced paths in breeding areas that receive &gt; 30 visitors a day has been shown to reduce the impact of human disturbance on this species' reproductive performance (Pearce-Higgins et al. 2007). It is also known to show increased hatching successes when ground predators have been excluded by erecting protective fences around nesting areas (Jackson 2001).","Numerous threats have been identified, but the extent to which any of them are driving observed declines is unknown, with much more research needed before threats can be targeted for mitigation.Climate change has been identified for several shorebird species as a threat that is driving reduced breeding productivity by a number of mechanisms (e.g. Meltofte et al. 2007, Eikelenboom 2016, Kubelka et al. 2018); more research for this species specifically is needed. Indirect impacts of hyperabundant geese (Ross's Goose Anser rossii and Snow Goose Anser caerulescens) have been reported (Flemming et al. 2019a) including increased risk of predation (Fleming et al. 2019b), although on a broader scale densities apparently remain consistent (Flemming et al. 2019c). Elsewhere on its breeding grounds, oil drilling has been identified as a possible threat, although this is highly localised (Bart et al. in prep.).The species is exposed to additional threats on its staging and wintering grounds, particularly habitat degradation and conversion. At Barr Al Hikman, Oman, where up to 26% of the Asian-East African Flyway population has been reported to overwinter, planned urban developments, the aquaculture (for shrimp) industry, oil refineries and disturbance from fishing industries and falcon hunting were all identified as threats by de Fouw et al. (2018) and these almost certainly apply to other important staging and wintering sites in the broader region. The extent of hunting in this region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet et al. 2016). The species is threatened on the south-east coast of India (Point Calimere) by illegal hunting (bird trapping), reservoir and marshland habitat alteration by salt-industries, and habitat degradation by diminishing rainfall (changing the salt regime) (Balachandran 2006). Rapid land-use change and loss of mudflats are also major threats here. It is also threatened at Walvis Bay in Namibia, a key wetland site in southern Africa, by habitat degradation (e.g. changes in the flood regime due to road building, and wetland reclamation for suburb and port development), and disturbance from tourism (Wearne and Underhill 2005). Again, these threats are probably widespread in the region. In the Americas there is no evidence of significant pesticide poisoning, although concentrations of other contaminants have been found to be high enough to cause sub-lethal effects (reviewed in Bart et al. in prep.).Significant numbers of C. alpina migrate down the Yellow and East China Seas where habitat loss and hunting are plausibly significant threats. The extent of reclaimed land along the Yellow Sea coastline now exceeds the extent of remaining intertidal mudflat (Murray et al. 2014, IUCN 2023), suggesting that this may have contributed greatly to declines in this species. The rate of habitat lost to land reclamation has slowed since a peak in c. 2013, in particular in recent years due to the promised near-ceasing of land reclamation in China in early 2018 (Melville 2018); however, recent satellite data suggests that the extent of intertidal mudflat has continued to decrease, in large part due to continued reclamations in the Korean Peninsula (IUCN 2023). Mudflats have also continued to degrade in suitability for this species and other shorebirds because of the invasive alien Spartina alterniflora cordgrass, which appears to be spreading; in recent (post 2020) years, this threat has probably driven greater declines than planned land reclamation. In addition to land reclamation, coastal development and a rapid increase in the human population along the coastline of the Yellow Sea has led to widespread degradation of mudflats and coastal habitats used by this species; IUCN (2023) (and references therein) cite the following as additional drivers of mudflat loss and degradation: 'processes such as changes in sediment supply, loss of coastal vegetation associated with development...erosion, redistribution of sediments due to storms, and compaction and subsidence (sinking) caused by subsurface resource and groundwater extraction are also likely to be factors'. Offshore windfarms may have a so far unquantified impact on birds due to collisions (unlikely) and displacement and disturbance of feeding birds (more likely). Disturbance on mudflats by fishermen and others using the mudflats may also be reasonably considered a threat. Hunting is also possibly a significant threat impacting this and other shorebird species on passage (Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020).","Breeding populations in North America are thought to total 1.56-3.21 million birds (Bart et al. in prep.). Old World populations sum to approximately 4.4 million birds (Delany et al. 2009, Nagy and Langendoen 2020, Hansen et al. 2022, Wetlands International 2023), but these data are largely collated from the species' non-breeding range and so may not all refer to mature individuals. Globally, the population is therefore estimated to number 3,000,000-7,000,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Breeds from northern Alaska (USA) and northern Canada east to south-west Baffin Island. Breeds in south-east Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and northern Europe , east throughout much of Siberia to the northern Sakhalin and Kuril Islands. Birds move south for the winter, chiefly to coastlines in southern North America and northern Central America, Western Europe, north and west Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, South Asia and East Asia.","Hunting is a probable threat to this species in parts of its range, as the hunting of shorebirds across the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is not uncommon (see, e.g., Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020, Yong et al. 2022). The extent of hunting in the Arabian Peninsula region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet et al. 2016). In North America and Europe hunting was formerly common and widespread, but this is no longer the case.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThis species is covered by the general protection regime provided by Article 1 of the European Union (EU) Birds Directive to all naturally occurring wild species in the EU. It is listed on Annex II (strictly protected) of the pan-European Bern Convention, Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and Annex II of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). Across the EU, 762 Natura 2000 sites have been designated for the conservation of this species (EEA 2024). The subspecies C. a. schinzii is listed on Annex I (special protection) of the Birds Directive, and is also listed by the Helsinki Convention (HELCOM) as a taxon that that is threatened and/or declining in the Baltic Sea. C. a. schinzii is included on the list of priority EU species that can benefit from a higher EU co-funding rate (up to 75%) under the LIFE Programme; to date (June 2024), the LIFE project database lists nine projects that have taken practical conservation measures for this subspecies, mainly in the Baltic at some of the 73 Natura 2000 sites designated for the conservation of this taxon. China is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to clear tidal mudflats of Spartina cordgrass, with the aim of eliminating 90% of it by 2025; locally, this has already been successful, for example at Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve (Stokstad 2023). The governments of China and South Korea have halted new projects that require or depend upon land reclamation, and across the Korean Peninsula the number of coastal wetlands has increased; moreover in China and South Korea, key areas for migratory shorebirds (including C. alpina) have been identified and prioritised by government and two World Heritage nominations have been made on these grounds (IUCN 2023). Although data on scale or impact are sparse, IUCN (2023) consider that ""support for coastal wetland conservation and wise-use appears to have increased over the last decade"". There has been a substantial increase in the number of volunteer groups and NGOs helping to monitor the migrations of shorebirds and other waterbirds, as well as increased media coverage and special events, demonstrating enhanced awareness among coastal communities (see also EAAFP 2016). North Korea became a Party to the Ramsar Convention and joined the EAAF Partnership in 2018. In 2021, the 'Regional Flyway Initiative' (RFI) was set up by the Asian Development Bank, with technical support from BirdLife International, with the aim of protecting and restoring priority wetland ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide in the East-Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), the most threatened flyway globally. The Initiative is slated for implementation in 10 East, South and South-East Asian countries: Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, all of which are used by C. alpina on northbound and southbound migrations between breeding and wintering areas, and many also for wintering. The RFI will mobilise large-scale financing to support the protection, sustainable management and restoration of at least 50 priority wetlands across ten Asian countries, with an initial financing commitment of $3 billion from the ADB (BirdLife International 2022). Over time, the RFI aims to enhance and expand the existing efforts in conserving and managing priority wetlands identified on the basis of supporting globally significant congregations of migratory waterbirds, and leverage on collaborative opportunities with stakeholders including national governments, civil society organizations, communities, regional organisations like the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership. A large portion of this species' breeding population is covered by PRISM surveys in North America, enabling regular monitoring.Conservation Actions ProposedEnsure population monitoring continues throughout and its range, and preferably expand it to other regions (particularly in East Asia and wintering grounds in Africa where data coverage is currently patchy). In the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, the main action needed for this is the amelioration of threats on its migration. China needs to implement its plan to eliminate 90+% of Spartina cordgrass to prevent further loss of feeding habitat (much has already been lost to land reclamation; IUCN 2023). The discharge of toxic pollutants into coastal wetlands (especially where there are large shorebird congregations) needs to be controlled. Further degradation of mudflats needs to be stopped, including monitoring and preventing detrimental release of riverine sediments and responsible planning of offshore windfarms. Tools are available, such as AviStep (https://avistep.birdlife.org/) to ensure sustainable building of renewable energy infrastructure. Many of these threats, particularly development of coastal wetlands, apply also to the Arabian Peninsula where there is a need for sensible policy-making and implementation to reduce illegal killing and habitat loss (Brochet et al. 2016, de Fouw et al. 2018).",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This species is therefore assessed as Near Threatened. It remains abundant and widely distributed, but the drivers of the decline are uncertain and require investigation.","Charadrius vociferus inhabits a wide range of open areas, including grasslands, mudflats, agricultural fields and shorelines. They are adaptable and can thrive in human-altered landscapes such as golf courses, parks, gravel roads and urban areas. Breeding sites need to be almost bare, usually with a clear view and are often on gravelly substrate. However many breed in agricultural fields: almost all observations in a study estimating the size of the breeding population in the Eastern Rainwater Basin in Nebraska came from agricultural fields, with a preference for fields that were planted with soybeans the previous year (Jorgensen et al. 2009).","It is currently uncertain what is causing the recorded reduction and there is an urgent need to elucidate the drivers and their relative impacts. Habitat modification and human disturbance are potential threats, however the species is attracted to many human environments and can thrive in altered landscapes. Additionally, while historically hunted, the species is protected by law and there is no evidence this remains a significant threat (Jackson and Jackson 2020). The high use of potentially risky agricultural habitats for breeding by a large proportion of the population in the north of the range warrants investigation (Jorgensen et al. 2009): there is the potential that this represents a sink habitat, with disturbance and nest loss from agricultural operations, exposure to potentially harmful chemicals (Fisk 1976) and reduced food resource (Fair 1995) which may result in lowered reproduction and survival. Direct mortality from pesticide application has been recorded (Fisk 1976). Disease may be an additional factor (Jackson and Jackson 2020).","This species is widespread and very commonly observed.

Rapid to very rapid reductions have been detected from a large network of migration sites in North America, which may reflect a significant reduction in reproductive success. But a decline has also been recorded across large-scale sampling surveys of the breeding range in Alaska. The precision of rate estimates may be poor due to the species’ low side fidelity and annual variation in stopover sites, but there appears reasonable evidence to support that a concerning decline is underway. Greater survey effort has resulted in the population size being revised upwards considerably, hence the species is not believed to be at risk due a small population size at present. Due to the likely rate of population reduction, Buff-breasted Sandpiper is assessed as Vulnerable.","This species breeds in the high Arctic on well drained tundra with tussocks and scant vegetation. It is generally not found near the sea and avoids inundated marshes. It appears to depend heavily upon intensive grazing by livestock in its wintering grounds to create short grassland (Lanctot et al. 2002, Aldabe 2016), but also uses flooded pampas grasslands (Blanco et al. 2004, Lanctot et al. 2004). During migration it is found on many short grass habitats (McCarty et al. 2009, Norling et al. 2012), and appears to have developed a strong association with turf farms in Texas (R. Lanctot in litt. 2024). At the internationally important Rainwater Basin stopover site in Nebraska, U.S.A., it was observed to feed primarily in agricultural land (soybeans, corn), and use wetlands for resting (McCarty et al. 2009). It is a lekking species.Throughout the non-breeding range and along the species’ migration route the area of suitable natural short grass habitat has decreased enormously since the 1800s and is continuing to be converted to agricultural cropland (Lanctot et al. 2010). While the species has adapted to using a variety of agricultural land that provides short grass habitat (c. 5-8 cm tall, R. Lanctot in litt. 2024), the increasing conversion to row crops and subsequent intensification of management (Piquer-Rodriguez et al. 2018) is inferred to result in an ongoing decline in habitat area and quality. The rapid conversion of savannah to oil palm and rice cultivation in the Colombian Llanos (Romero-Ruiz et al. 2011) undoubtedly reduces the quality and likely the area of habitat available in this key pre-breeding migration staging area (Lanctot et al. 2016, Fink et al. 2023).","Habitat loss in the non-breeding and migratory stopover sites is likely to be one of or the primary drivers of population reductions. The species has proved able to adapt to the conversion of natural grassland to grazed pasture and in migratory stopover sites also uses tilled cropland, including soy beans and corn fields (McCarty et al. 2020). However, the ongoing conversion of grazed land to crops within the limited non-breeding area and subsequent intensification of agricultural management of that land (Lanctot et al. 2010, Piquer-Rodriguez et al. 2018, COSEWIC 2021) is thought to be at sufficient intensity to be causing population impacts. Changes in grazing regime that result in taller vegetation reduce the area of suitable foraging habitat (Lanctot et al. 2010). The Llanos grasslands, a key pre-breeding migration stopover site (Garcia-Ruiz et al. 2013, Lanctot et al. 2016), are rapidly being converted to oil palm and rice in Colombia (Romero-Ruiz et al. 2011), which are unsuitable habitats for this species. Habitat shifting caused by climate change is a severe future threat that is considered likely to result in a decline in habitat availability, although current predictions are uncertain (Anderson et al. 2024). What has been demonstrated is that the species is already being lost from some study areas near the south of the breeding range (Andersen et al. 2023), and rapid changes in abundance at some sites appear driven by shifts in the range, noting that the species breeds to the northward limit of land. Using a species distribution model approach Wauchope et al. (2017) predicted that under future climate change scenarios RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 Buff-breasted Sandpiper would lose around 50% of climatically suitable breeding habitat by 2070. Climate change may also affect the species during migration by increasing the severity of storms over the western Atlantic that could directly impact survival rates of juveniles, which predominately use this pathway during southbound migration (Lanctot et al. 2010).The species was severely overhunted in the late 1800s and the early part of the 1900s, reportedly declining to near extinction from a population which may have numbered in the hundreds of thousands to millions (Lanctot et al. 2010, McCarty et al. 2020). Current hunting mortality is poorly known but not thought to be significant and is unlikely to be close to the Potential Biological Removal value set at 921 to 1,847 mature individuals (Watts et al. 2015, McCarty et al. 2020). Hunting mortality does continue in Barbados, though this species is taken inadvertently from mixed flocks and it is strictly protected in the country (Wege et al. 2014). This species is rare in the areas where high levels of shorebird hunting have been recorded recently and is not considered to be at significant risk (AFSI 2020).Exposure on migration to toxic chemicals and pollutants in its agricultural feeding grounds may pose a threat (McCarty et al. 2020). There is evidence that individuals are exposed to cholinesterase-inhibiting organophosphorus and carbamate pesticides in rice and cattle pastures in Argentina and Paraguay, which affect the birds' physiology (Strum et al. 2010) and may reduce individual condition sufficiently to result in carry over effects on migration and the subsequent breeding season. High levels of chemicals are applied in the turf farms that are now heavily favoured by the species at stopover sites sites along the Gulf of Mexico (R. Lanctot in litt. 2024, McCarty et al. 2020); any population impact of these is uncertain. There has also not been any assessment of the impacts of new classes of agricultural chemicals, such as neonicotinoids (Gibbons et al. 2015).","The global population has most recently been estimated at 550,000 individuals (Bart et al. in prep.). This value is based on the final estimate from the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) surveys on the breeding grounds (Bart and Smith 2012, Smith et al. in prep.). The final estimate for Arctic Canada was 568,395 individuals (95% CI 358,000-654,000) (Smith et al. in prep.), with an additional 42,588 (5,856-79,260) individuals in Alaska (ECCC 2021, Smith et al. in prep.), giving a total of 610,983 individuals (364,000-733,000). The entire Canada and USA range was included within the sampled area (Smith et al. in prep.). These surveys target breeding pairs in suitable breeding habitat, hence the values derived are considered to relate to mature individuals. However, this estimate has been derived from a low number of survey plots and the habitat strata to which densities are applied are coarse (R. Lanctot in litt. (2024). For this species, which has a lek mating system and fine-scale habitat selection, densities can be highly variable and unpredictable making extrapolations based on habitat association potentially misleading (ECCC 2021). These concerns are emphasised by the low number of observations on which final numbers are based: only 60 observations produced the Alaskan estimate (Smith et al. in prep.), hence the very wide confidence intervals. The previous population estimate was 56,000 individuals (Lanctot et al. 2010, Andres et al. 2012), from a range of 23,000 (Jorgensen et al. 2008) to 84,000 individuals (Norling et al. 2012), later refined to 35,000-78,000 by Andres et al. (2012). Numbers in non-breeding areas also suggest a much smaller population than that generated by the PRISM surveys, or that a large proportion of this breeding population are unaccounted for by surveys to date (McCarty et al. 2020). Surveys of the non-breeding population in southern Brazil recorded approximately 3,400 individuals (Faria et al. 2023): this is a small proportion of the main wintering area.Given the uncertainty, the population is here placed in a wide range and the best value is considered to fall below that estimated from the PRISM surveys. It seems likely that the true population size is considerably larger than the 56,000 previously estimated. Using the upper bound of the previous values, 84,000 (derived from a single season extrapolation of counts of spring migrants in Texas [Norling et al. 2012]) as a minimum seems actually precautionary: a long stopover duration was used in this calculation where the true value is likely shorter, and shorter stopovers mean that a greater number of individuals have passed through to study area (ECCC 2021). Similarly, estimates from Nebraska's Rainwater Basin of 43,300 (Jorgenson et al. 2008) were based on a longer stopover duration than later estimated at the site (McCarty 2015) and a greater number of individuals likely passed through the site. It is also important to note that a proportion of the population skip these sites, further suggesting the population size considerably exceeds the reported value. Considering the various data, the population is here placed in a band of between 84,000-364,000, representing the minimum number based on extrapolation of counts at spring staging locations (Norling et al. 2012) and the low bound of the estimate based on the PRISM surveys (Smith et al. in prep.).The population today is considered to have been greatly reduced from historic levels due to 19th century market hunting and the loss of much short-grass prairie from North America (McCarty et al. 2020).",Decreasing,"The species breeds in the low arctic and subarctic tundra largely in Arctic Canada but also along the north slope of Alaska (United States of America) and in Chukotka, Russia, west to the Ekvyvatap River and Wrangel Island (McCarty et al. 2020). It undertakes a long-distance migration to non-breeding areas in coastal and interior areas of Argentina, and coastal Uruguay and southernmost Brazil. An unknown number winter further inland in Argentina (McCarty et al. 2020, Fink et al. 2023) but it does not regularly winter in Paraguay (R.P. Clay in litt. 2024). Grasslands in north-central Bolivia and Amazonian rivers in Peru appear to be heavily used during the post breeding migration (Fink et al. 2023). The majority of adults use a rather narrow migration corridor and few major stopover sites during the pre breeding migration: the Llanos in Colombia and Venezuela, north coast of the Gulf of Mexico in Texas and Louisiana and sites in the eastern Great Plains, especially the Rainwater basin in Nebraska, and into Canada through Manitoba and Saskatchwan (Lanctot et al. 2002, Jorgenson et al. 2008, Ruiz-Guerra et al. 2013, Lanctot et al. 2016, McCarty et al. 2020, Fink et al. 2023). It is generally scarce but regular in eastern US states on southbound migration and has been widely recorded as a vagrant (McCarty et al. 2020, Fink et al. 2023).","This species was targeted by market hunters in the 19th century, noted to have caused a significant population reduction in the species (McCarty et al. 2020) although a genetic investigation showed no evidence of a population bottleneck from this time (Lounsberry et al. 2014). The species is rare in countries that still harvest large numbers of shorebirds and does not feature in harvest index assessments (AFSI 2020). However on Barbados they are sometimes inadvertently harvested despite being protected by the 1907 Barbados Wild Birds Protection Act, which makes hunting the species illegal (Wege et al. 2014). A review of global trade recorded a low incidence of ongoing trade, with the species being found in one of the seven trade datasets evaluated (Donald et al. 2024). A Potential Biological Removal estimate was generated for the species at 921 to 1,847 mature individuals (Watts et al. 2015), a low value but not currently expected to be approached.",Terrestrial,"Conservation Actions UnderwayCMS Appendix I and II. Several symposia have been held and the Buff-breasted Sandpiper Conservation Working Group has been formed to identify priority actions and bring together individuals and organisations involved in conservation action and research for the species (Anon. 2020). A conservation plan was prepared for the species in 2010 that lists priority actions for the species (Lanctot et al. 2010). Intensive field surveys are on-going in Texas and Nebraska, and a range-wide tracking study is underway to document migration routes and key staging, breeding and wintering locations (Lanctot et al. 2016). Intensive range management and site conservation are underway in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Bolivia. Conservation Actions ProposedImplement priority actions identified in the Buff-breasted Sandpiper Conservation plan and the 2015 symposium. Ascertain the population size and trend for the species.  Identify migration routes and conserve key breeding, staging and wintering locations. Investigate the quality of foraging habitat and further investigate the influence of contaminants in agricultural areas used during migration (McCarty et al. 2009) and while wintering (Strum et al. 2008, 2010).",Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
256610578,22693348,Limnodromus scolopaceus,Near Threatened,A2b+4b,2024,2024-07-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although uncertain, data from both the non-breeding range and from migration sites indicate that the population has been declining at a moderately rapid to rapid rate of at least 20% over the past three generations. The population size and range remain large. The drivers of these declines are uncertain and require investigation, though actions to secure the availability of favoured temporary shallow wetlands at key points in the annual cycle are expected to benefit the species. As rates of population reduction approach threatened thresholds, Long-billed Dowitcher is assessed as Near Threatened.","The species breeds in wet, freshwater grass or sedge meadows in the tundra (Takekawa and Warnock 2020). Occurs in a variety of wetland habitats including saline or brackish lagoons on passage and in the non-breeding season (Takekawa and Warnock 2020), but in Mexico noted to move to intertidal flats by the end of the period (Engilis 1998). Fully migratory, with most birds crossing North America along the central flyway but some passing along the Pacific flyway (Kwon and Kempenaers 2023). With little clear information on drivers of decline, and little evidence of obvious habitat loss, it is suspected but not clear that there is a reduction in at least the quality of the species' habitat. More research is required to understand if habitat area or extent is declining, and if it is the limiting factor for the species.","The threats causing the recorded population reductions are uncertain. A high proportion of the population relies on wetlands, including flooded agricultural fields during the non-breeding season and along the migratory route, where loss of wetland habitat has been severe throughout the past century, but rates of loss are now at lower levels. During migration, this species relies heavily on temporarily inundated wetlands, which are often individually small areas that may be poorly monitored (Albanese and Davies 2013). The extent of availability of this habitat is dependent on precipitation, such that the average drier conditions under a changing climate in this region could already be reducing availability of a key resource in the pre-breeding season. More research in this area is required. The species is already breeding to the northernmost extent of the landmass. Available breeding habitat based on predicted distribution under future climate change scenarios is predicted to reduce by between 64% (RCP 4.5) and 71% (RCP 8.5) by 2070 (Wauchope et al. 2017).Using agricultural habitats exposes the species to agricultural chemicals such as DDE that may accumulate to harmful levels, noted in individuals examined in south Texas (White et al. 1983), although data from this study is now 45 years old.In the past market hunting is thought to have severely impacted the species' population. Currently there seems to be only a very low level of hunting occurring, with small numbers shot when mistaken for snipe around the Gulf Coast (G. Apte in litt. 2024) and perhaps small numbers opportunistically taken by subsistence hunters in Alaska (Naves et al. 2019). Watts et al. (2015) generated a Potential Biological Removal level of 52,420 ± 13,717: current levels of hunting are not thought to be anywhere near this mean level.","The breeding population size in Alaska and Canada has been estimated at 674,327 from the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) (Bart and Smith 2012, Smith et al. in prep.). In addition, an uncertain but large number breed in eastern Siberia in Russia. Comments in Partners in Flight (2023) on population size suggest the Russian population is at least 130,000 (B. Andres 2020, cited in PiF 2023), suggesting the population size is around 800,000 mature individuals. The previous estimate of 500,000 (Andres et al. 2012) appears to have been an underestimate. Elsewhere there is the suggestion that the total population size could be as high as a million birds (Bart et al. in prep.), which is used here as a maximum value.",Decreasing,"Breeds from the southwestern Taimyr Peninsula eastwards through Siberia, on Wrangel Island, and south to Kamchatka, Russia, western and northern Alaska, United States of America (USA), and northwestern Canada (Takekawa and Warnock 2020). This species winters further north than Short-billed Dowitcher and many other migratory shorebirds in the Americas, with the bulk of the population remaining within the United States and Mexico around the Gulf Coast and Mississippi River valley, as well as in the Central Valley in California and south to the Salton Sea and Gulf of Santa Clara. Birds occur south along the Pacific coast to Panama and along the Caribbean south to Nicaragua (Fink et al. 2023). Very few are considered to regularly winter in South America (Takekawa and Warnock 2020, Fink et al. 2023). The majority of birds fitted with satellite tags in the Alaskan breeding range followed a migration route through the central flyway to winter around the Gulf coast, with some using the Pacific flyway to winter in central California (Kwon and Kempenaers 2023). The Prairie Potholes region is especially important as a staging site during the pre-breeding migration (Skagen and Thompson 2013).","In the 19th century large numbers were shot for food which is believed to have caused a significant population reduction (Takekawa and Warnock 2020). Harvest today is thought minimal: some may accidentally be shot by hunters targeting snipe (G. Apte in litt. 2024) and a few may be taken by subsistence hunters in Alaska (Naves et al. 2019). Watts et al. (2015) generated a Potential Biological Removal level of 52,420 ± 13,717: current levels of hunting are not thought to be anywhere near this mean level.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions In PlaceProtected under the Migratory Birds Act (1927). This species' non-breeding population is part-covered by the Christmas Bird Count (Meehan et al. 2022); it is covered by the International Shorebird Survey during migration (Brown et al. 2001, Smith et al. 2023); and partly covered by the International Waterbird Census during the non-breeding season (Wetlands International 2023).Conservation Actions NeededMore research is needed to establish drivers of population reductions. Habitat shifts due to climate change may already be affecting the species. Targeted monitoring in non-breeding and migration areas is needed to improve the precision of trend estimates. To support this and other shorebird species during their crucial  pre-breeding migrations region-wide wetland management plans are needed to ensure landscape level availability of a mosaic of wetland habitats (Albanese and Davies 2013).",Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The causes of these declines are not well unknown, but the drainage of peatlands for forestry in its European breeding grounds has been suggested as a very likely contributor to declines. Across its passage and wintering grounds it is also exposed to numerous other threats, including habitat loss due to land reclamation, hunting and disturbance from fishing activities.","Behaviour This species is a full migrant, and migrates on a broad front (del Hoyo et al. 1996) by making short flights between a series of stop-over sites (Verkuil et al. 2006). Adults breeding in Fennoscandia leave the breeding grounds in July (juveniles departing in August), and stop-over in substantial numbers in Sivash, southern Ukraine, on the Middle Eastern coasts, Caspian Sea and Bulgarian seaboard, before arriving in wintering grounds in Africa, Pakistan and south India between August and early-October (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Eastern breeding populations migrate on a broad front across the taiga, or along the eastern edge of the continent between September and October, and return in April-May (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The Fennoscandian breeding population departs the wintering grounds in the spring between mid-April and early-June (del Hoyo et al. 1996). A few non-breeding birds also remain at the wintering sites during the summer (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding occurs in early- to late-June in Fennoscandia, and between mid-June and early-July in Russia, pairs nesting in loose colonies of 2-10 nests, usually spaced 80-100 m apart (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species migrates singly or in small groups, although during the spring migration flocks of up to several hundred can occur (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding This species breeds in the wettest parts of bogs (Snow and Perrins 1998) and on open peatland; the Scandinavian and north-west Russian populations breeding in the subarctic montane and lowland zones above 200 m (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (around 1,000 m in Norway) (Snow and Perrins 1998), and the Siberian population breeding in wet Arctic tundra (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Non-breeding On migration this species shows a preference for muddy and boggy areas on the shores of ponds and lakes, but it is also found on shallow freshwater, brackish and saline (sometimes hyper-saline) lagoons, temporary swamps, flooded rice-fields, overgrazed wet meadows, inlets of fjords (del Hoyo et al. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species mainly overwinters on large, soft intertidal mudflats, in brackish lagoons, on saltpans (del Hoyo et al. 1996), sewage farms and saltmarshes (Snow and Perrins 1998). Diet This species is omnivorous, its diet consisting of marine nereid worms, small bivalves and snails, crustaceans (e.g. amphipods), adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, flies, grasshoppers, ants) (del Hoyo et al. 1996), as well as the seeds of aquatic plants (Snow and Perrins 1998). Breeding site The nest is a cup on top of a wet sedge or moss cushion, well raised above the water level (Johnsgard 1981).","Numerous threats identified across its range, although the extent to which these are contributing to estimated population declines is largely unknown. In Finland, which likely hosts at least 50% of the global breeding population, drainage of peatlands for forestry is considered the chief threat (Fraixedas et al. 2017, Keller et al. 2020, BirdLife International 2021) and this was also attributed previously to local extinctions in Norway (van Gils and Wiersma 1996). The species is exposed to additional threats on its staging and wintering grounds, particularly habitat degradation and conversion. At Barr Al Hikman, Oman, where up to 8% of the Asian-East African Flyway has been reported to overwinter (Eriksen 1996), planned urban developments, the aquaculture (for shrimp) industry, oil refineries and disturbance from fishing industries and falcon hunting were all identified as threats by de Fouw et al. (2018) and these almost certainly apply to other important staging and wintering sites in the broader region. The extent of hunting in this region is poorly known, but shorebirds are occasionally targeted (Brochet et al. 2016). Significant numbers of C. falcinellus migrate down the Yellow and East China Seas where habitat loss and hunting are plausibly significant threats. Astonishingly, the extent of reclaimed land along the Yellow Sea coastline now exceeds the extent of remaining intertidal mudflat (IUCN 2023), suggesting that this may have contributed greatly to declines in this species. The rate of habitat lost to land reclamation has slowed since a peak in c. 2013, in particular in recent years due to the promised near-ceasing of land reclamation in China in early 2018 (Melville 2018); however, recent satellite data suggests that the extent of intertidal mudflat has continued to decrease, in large part due to continued reclamations in the Korean Peninsula (IUCN 2023). Mudflats have also continued to degrade in suitability for this species and other shorebirds because of the invasive alien Spartina alterniflora cordgrass, which appears to be spreading; in recent (post 2020) years, this threat has probably driven greater declines than planned land reclamation. In addition to land reclamation, coastal development and a rapid increase in the human population along the coastline of the Yellow Sea has led to widespread degradation of mudflats and coastal habitats used by this species; IUCN (2023) (and references therein) cite the following as additional drivers of mudflat loss and degradation: 'processes such as changes in sediment supply, loss of coastal vegetation associated with development...erosion, redistribution of sediments due to storms, and compaction and subsidence (sinking) caused by subsurface resource and groundwater extraction are also likely to be factors'. Offshore windfarms may have a so far unquantified impact on birds due to collisions (unlikely) and displacement and disturbance of feeding birds (more likely). Disturbance on mudflats by fishermen and others using the mudflats may also be reasonably considered a threat. Hunting is also possibly a significant threat impacting this and other shorebird species on passage (Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020). In Australia, there are unlikely to be any substantial threats.","Divided into two subspecies, with the nominate breeding in Fennoscandia and north-west Russia, and sibirica breeding in central and eastern Siberia. Almost all of the nominate subspecies breeds in Europe, where there are estimated to be be 30,000-44,000 pairs, most of which (25,000-35,000 pairs) are in Finland (Keller et al. 2020). A much smaller number (&lt;1,200 pairs) breed in European Russia (Keller et al. 2020). When immatures and non-breeding birds are taken into account, these numbers are similar to the wintering population of 61,000-110,000 birds estimated (BirdLife International 2021, Wetlands International 2023). Taxon sibirica is estimated to number 30,000 birds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway (Mundkur and Langendoen 2022, Hansen et al. 2023); assuming approximately 0.6-0.8 birds are mature, this equates to c.18,000-24,000 breeding pairs. Overall, the global population of this species is estimated a 48,000-68,000 breeding pairs, or 96,000-136,000 mature individuals.",Decreasing,"Two subspecies: nominate C. f. falcinellus breeds in Scandinavia and north-west Russia, while C. f. sibirica breeds in north-east Siberia. The former winters widely across east Africa and Arabia to western India and Sri Lanka, while the latter winters in east India, throughout South-East Asia, the Philippines, Indonesia and Australia.","Hunting has not been identified as a specific threat to this species, but hunting of shorebirds across the East Asian-Australasian Flyway is not uncommon (see, e.g., Gallo-Cajiao et al. 2020, Yong et al. 2022) and it is possible this species is exploited. However, it is unknown whether this is driving population declines.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayThere is regular/annual monitoring of this species across its breeding, passage and wintering ranges. This species is not listed on the annexes of the European Union (EU) Birds Directive, but is covered by the general protection regime provided by Article 1 of the Directive to all naturally occurring wild species in the EU. It is listed on Annex II (strictly protected) of the pan-European Bern Convention, Annex II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and Annex I of the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA). Across the EU, 156 Natura 2000 sites have been designated for this species, especially in Finland (which holds most of the EU breeding population) but also in countries where it occurs on passage (EUNIS 2024). It is included on the list of priority EU species that can benefit from a higher EU co-funding rate (up to 75%) under the LIFE Programme, although to date (June 2024) the LIFE project database does not list any projects that have taken practical conservation measures for this species. Outside of the EU it occurs in numerous protected areas, particularly on passage and wintering grounds. China is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to clear tidal mudflats of Spartina cordgrass, with the aim of eliminating 90% of it by 2025; locally, this has already been successful, for example at Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve (Stokstad 2023). The governments of China and South Korea have halted new projects that require or depend upon land reclamation, and across the Korean Peninsula the number of coastal wetlands has increased; moreover in China and South Korea, key areas for migratory shorebirds (including C. falcinellus) have been identified and prioritised by government and two World Heritage nominations have been made on these grounds (IUCN 2023). Although data on scale or impact are sparse, IUCN (2023) consider that ""support for coastal wetland conservation and wise-use appears to have increased over the last decade"". There has been a substantial increase in the number of volunteer groups and NGOs helping to monitor the migrations of shorebirds and other waterbirds, as well as increased media coverage and special events, demonstrating enhanced awareness among coastal communities. North Korea (which is only of marginal importance to this species) became a Party to the Ramsar Convention and joined the EAAF Partnership in 2018, demonstrating their commitment to the conservation of coastal wetlands. In 2021, the 'Regional Flyway Initiative' (RFI) was set up by the Asian Development Bank, with technical support from BirdLife International, with the aim of protecting and restoring priority wetland ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide in the East-Asian Australasian Flyway (EAAF), the most threatened flyway globally. The Initiative is slated for implementation in 10 East, South and Southeast Asian countries:  Mongolia, China, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, all of which are used by C. falcinellus on northbound and southbound migrations between breeding and wintering areas. The RFI will mobilise large-scale financing to support the protection, sustainable management and restoration of at least 50 priority wetlands across ten Asian countries, with an initial financing commitment of $3 billion from the ADB (BirdLife International 2022). Over time, the RFI aims to enhance and expand the existing efforts in conserving and managing priority wetlands identified on the basis of supporting globally significant congregations of migratory waterbirds, and  leverage on collaborative opportunities with stakeholders including national governments, civil society organizations, communities, regional organisations like the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership. The discharge of toxic pollutants into coastal wetlands may also be a threat.Conservation Actions ProposedIn Europe (particularly Finland), there is an urgent need to safeguard peatland breeding grounds from forestry.  In the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, the main action needed for this is the amelioration of threats on its migration. China needs to implement its plan to eliminate 90+% of Spartina cordgrass to prevent further loss of feeding habitat (much has already been lost to land reclamation; IUCN 2023). The discharge of toxic pollutants into coastal wetlands (especially where there are large shorebird congregations) needs to be controlled. Further degradation of mudflats needs to be stopped, including monitoring and preventing detrimental release of riverine sediments and responsible planning of offshore windfarms. Tools are available, such as AviStep (https://avistep.birdlife.org/) to ensure sustainable building of renewable energy infrastructure. In order to evaluate the success of the conservation actions listed above, robust monitoring is needed, preferably at all stages of its migration cycle. Many of these threats, particularly development of coastal wetlands, apply also to the Arabian Peninsula where there is a need for sensible policy-making and implementation to reduce illegal killing and habitat loss (Brochet et al. 2016, de Fouw et al. 2018).",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Due to the rate of population reduction, the species is assessed as Vulnerable.","Limosa fedoa primarily inhabit North American prairie wetlands during the breeding season, where they feed on invertebrates, plant material and small fish, migrating to coastal mudflats, estuaries and sandy beaches for the non-breeding season where they predominately eat worms, bivalves and crustaceans (Gratto-Trevor 2020). A proportion of the population remains in non-breeding areas each year.","Parmelee, but the primary threat identified for the species is the loss of habitat in breeding and staging sites due to conversion to agriculture, particularly to crops and indeed partly the switch to crops from pasture (Melcher et al. 2010). Infrastructure development, including that associated with the oil industry, and the subdivision of suitable habitat by roads are also considered to have reduced available habitat in breeding areas (Melcher et al. 2010). In the non-breeding areas large-scale development is also cited as a threat causing habitat loss and degradation (Gratto-Trevor 2020, Muñoz-Salas et al. 2023).The species has suffered mortality from periodic botulism outbreaks in staging sites during the post-breeding migration, which can cause notable additional mortality but to date do not appear to have long-term impacts (Melcher et al. 2010). Collision mortality with powerlines in the breeding areas appears to be high, especially in S Alberta where density of powerlines is high: multiple deaths and injuries likely to result in death or failed reproduction have been reported (Gratto-Trevor 2020). This mortality is not suspected to have large population impacts, but may cause slow declines for the adjacent breeding population.Historically hunted, though the species is protected by law and there is no evidence this remains a significant threat. Possible alternative drivers for recent declines include disease, direct or indirect impacts of agricultural chemicals, impacts of increasing rates of disturbance in non-breeding areas (especially beaches) or currently unidentified impacts of a changing climate regime in either breeding, staging or non-breeding sites (Melcher et al. 2010, Gratto-Trevor 2020, Muñoz-Salas et al. 2023). Dewatering of regions has been cited as potential threat in non-breeding and migration sites but impacts are unknown (Melcher et al. 2010). Research is needed to identify which may be causing population impacts.","The global population is estimated to number 270,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2023), and is assumed to be structured into two subpopulations that accord with the two species recognised in the species.A combination of monitoring data from breeding, migration and especially non-breeding sites indicates that there is currently a rapid population reduction underway (Ziolkowski et al. 2022, Muñoz-Salas et al. 2023, Smith et al. 2023).",Decreasing,"Most breed in the northern grasslands (prairie potholes region) of the United States of America (USA) and southern Canada, with small, isolated populations along coast of James Bay and on the Alaska Peninsula. Those breeding in Alaska are recognised as a separate subspecies, L. f. beringiae (Gratto-Trevor 2020), while the James Bay population are considered to belong to the nominate subpopulation. All individuals migrate from breeding areas to winter coastally in North and Central America, with greatest concentrations in central to southern California and Mexico but birds found south to Panama (Gratto-Trevor 2020) and less regularly in Ecuador and northern Peru (Fink et al. 2023). The breeding range is more restricted than the non-breeding and is used for the extent of occurrence: this still exceeds 4 million square kilometres. However, given the estimated rates of population reduction it is inferred that the Area of Occupancy is declining, although uncertainty over the drivers of decline means that it is not possibly to infer that the area, extent or quality of habitat is declining.","Historically hunted, though the species is protected by law and there is no evidence this remains a significant threat, though some are thought to still be taken in Mexico during the non-breeding season (Gratto-Trevor 2020).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Conservation Actions UnderwayNo targeted actions known, however protected by the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act.Conservation Actions ProposedContinue to monitor population trends.

The magnitude of the trend is uncertain, and a proportion of the population is not sampled by these surveys, but the migration count survey is considered the most representative dataset for the species. Moderately rapid reductions are also evident from eBird data. Drivers of the recorded decline are uncertain, although likely a combination of threats identified for other declining shorebird species also apply here. The population size and range both remain large. On the basis of the rate of population reduction, Short-billed Dowitcher is assessed as Vulnerable.","Confusion with L. scolopaceus has meant that many aspects of this species have remained poorly known until relatively recently (Jehl Jr. et al. 2020). It breeds in muskeg swamp in the subarctic taiga from the edge of the boreal forest just about to the tundra, uses scattered bushes or trees for display (Jehl Jr. et al. 2020). During the non-breeding season it occurs largely in coastal areas, preferring saltwater habitat and especially tidal mudflats rather than sandy substrates. Also occurs in flooded agricultural fields (Jehl Jr. et al. 2020).Migration is typically undertaken along the coast, with Suriname seemingly the point of both northbound departure and southbound arrival for many individuals (Jehl Jr. et al. 2020). Feeds on invertebrates.With little clear information on drivers of decline, and little evidence of obvious habitat loss, it is suspected but not clear that there is a reduction in at least the quality of the species' habitat. More research is required to understand if habitat area or extent is declining, and if it is the limiting factor for the species.","There is little clear evidence for the drivers of the recorded reductions. Effects of climate change have been predicted to cause increased risk to the species by affecting migration and non-breeding sites (Galbraith et al. 2014). Impacts of habitat change in coastal areas, either through development or disturbance may be affecting the species in northern South America and Central America, but evidence is lacking and there is only a reference that development of coastal lagoons in Venezuela may be an issue (Jehl Jr. et al. 2020). The species uses flooded agricultural fields in addition to natural coastal sites: it is not clear that habitat availability has greatly changed. The species breeds at the zone of transition along the northern edge of the boreal forest (Jehl Jr. et al. 2020): it is plausible though unstudied that climate impacts are affecting this zone that impact the species' reproductive success. It is possible that impacts of increasing populations of predators on breeding grounds may lead to increased adult mortality as well as reduced reproductive success.Hunting may affect the easternmost portion of the population that migrates through the Caribbean. Dowitchers were not represented in subsistence hunting in Alaska (Naves et al. 2019). Hunting is still permitted on Saint Pierre and Miquelon (AFSI 2020), but numbers are unlikely to be significant. In the Caribbean Islands an index of harvest was judged to be moderately high (scoring three out of four) for the Caribbean Islands (AFSI 2020). The species accounted for 4-11% of the hunted total of shorebirds on Barbados, representing 700–2,400 individuals of the species taken based on mean harvest from 1988-2010 (Wege et al. 2014). The Potential Biological Removal (mean) derived for the species is 4,847 ± 1,252 individuals (Watts et al. 2015), suggesting that there is a plausible risk of unsustainable harvest in the species. The largest numbers of Short-billed Dowitcher in the Caribbean have been recorded from Cuba (Cañizares and Reed 2020), where there is no data on any harvest. Many also winter along the north coast of Brazil, where assessment of harvest is needed (AFSI 2020). However the harvest in Barbados has been reducing in recent years (Wege et al. 2014, AFSI 2020). None were recorded in markets for sale in Guyana, although the species is present, suggesting any harvest here is negligible (Andres et al. 2022).Recreational disturbance is observed to be correlated with declines in counts at mudflat sites monitored over time (Drever et al. 2016), which may affect survival and condition ahead of the commencement of the breeding season.Noted to have been a prime target of market hunters in the 19th century (Jehl Jr. et al. 2020), but there was no documentation of the extent of impacts on the species' status. It is believed to have suffered large population declines before recovering prior to the 1970s (Jehl Jr. et al. 2020).","The global population is currently estimated at 245,000 mature individuals (Wetlands International 2023). Previously a lower value was estimated at 153,000 mature individuals (Andres et al. 2012), based on Jehl Jr. et al. (2020; first published in 2001). This estimates about 75,000 L. g. caurinus/Pacific populations and 78,000 L. g. hendersoni/griseus/Atlantic and Gulf coasts (Jehl Jr. et al. 2020). However more than 100,000 of the latter group were estimated to be breeding in Canada (Morrison et al. 1994), and this value is increased to 170,000 in Wetlands International (2023). A higher value of 320,000 was supplied for the United States Shorebird Conservation Plan (Brown 2001) and given the difficulty in adequately covering the population in either breeding or non-breeding areas this is a plausible high bound. The species is not covered by the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) surveys as it breeds further south, but the observation that these systematic surveys typically increased estimates significantly suggests the current population size may be conservative.",Decreasing,"Breeds from Kodiak Island and the Alaska Peninsula east through south coastal Alaska, United States of America (USA), northern British Columbia south to Queen Charlotte Island, Yukon and Northwest Territories inland to Alberta, Manitoba and south Hudson Bay, around James Bay and east to Quebec and central Labrador, Canada (Jehl Jr. et al. 2020). Recent data suggest that the species is now breeding in western Alaska (Fink et al. 2023), which may represent a westward shift in distribution. Three subspecies are recognised, L. g. griseus is the easternmost, breeding in Quebec and western Labrador, North Twin Island (Nunavut) in James Bay, while L. g. hendersoni breeds from Aksimiski Island in James Bay west to Alberta. L. g. caurinus occurs furthest west into Alaska. Winters along the coast, from southern USA (from north California on the Pacific and south Virginia on the Atlantic) south to central Peru, around the Gulf Coast and the Caribbean and from Colombia to east central Brazil (Jehl Jr. et al. 2020).","Hunting may affect the easternmost portion of the population that migrates through the Caribbean.

It also has a large estimated population size (190,000 mature individuals; Partners in Flight 2023), and so does not approach Criteria C or D thresholds. Considering its population trend over three generations (c. 10 years), the data presented in Smith et al. (2023) indicate a rapid decline of c. 50%, albeit with interannual fluctuations. Conversely, the Breeding Bird Survey (Ziolkowski et al. 2022) recorded a c. 5% increase over the same period, as part of a slow long-term increase. This is mirrored by data from the Christmas Bird Count (Meehan et al. 2022), which suggest an increase of c. 17% in the non-breeding population in the southern USA (following a slow long-term increase there, possibly due to short-stopping under climate change). Partners in Flight (2023) infers that the most likely overall trend is a c. 11% increase. Overall the trend is considered unknown, and the species therefore does not approach Criterion A thresholds. The species therefore continues to warrant listing as Least Concern.","","Deforestation in boreal forests poses an increasing threat in some regions. On its wintering grounds, the species is too dispersed to be significantly affected by hunting, unlike other shorebirds that flock in coastal areas (Moskoff 2020). Climate change has also been postulated a potential future threat by degrading available habitat (Cheskey et al. 2011, Galbraith et al. 2014).","The species has a large estimated population size of 190,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2023).",Unknown,"This species breeds from central Alaska (USA) through northern Canada, including the Yukon, Northwest Territories, northern provinces such as Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario, and extending east to central Quebec and southern Labrador.

Potentially significant levels of mortality in parts of the non-breeding range and along migratory routes have the potential to be driving declines that the poor coverage of the BBS survey for the species has so far not detected. Loss of key habitat may also contribute, though the species is able to use a wide range of wet habitat and it is unclear that the amount of habitat available has declined. The magnitude of the population decline is uncertain, and the migration count data itself may not adequately sample this species, but it is considered the most representative dataset for the species. The range and population size are large. On a precautionary basis due to the recorded rate of population reduction, Greater Yellowlegs is assessed as Near Threatened.","Breeds in wetland habitats from the boreal forest transition in the taiga zone to the subarctic tundra (Elphick and Tibbitts 2020). On migration and in the non-breeding season occurs in a variety of wetland habitats, fresh, brackish and saltwater, including human-made habitats such as salt evaporation ponds, flooded agriculture, ponds and reservoirs (Elphick and Tibbitts 2020). Feeds on aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, and occasionally fish and frogs.","The species is harvested at a moderately high rate in the Caribbean Islands and a medium rate in northern South America (AFSI 2020, Andres et al. 2022). Numbers recorded as taken do not approach a Potential Biological Removal value of of 10,210 ± 2,234 (Watts et al. 2015), but a revised framework for Lesser Yellowlegs indicated a far lower threshold for sustainable take (Rivera-Milán et al. 2023, which if found to apply similarly to Greater Yellowlegs suggests harvest may be unsustainable. The species uses a wide range of wetland habitats, but the loss of wetlands in parts of the non-breeding range and in migratory stopover sites may have reduced the area of suitable habitat in some key areas. As examples, wetlands in the south-east South American grasslands have been lost and degraded due to conversion to agriculture, principally annual crops such as soy beans (Miñarro and Bilenca 2008), and approximately 40% of wetland habitat in south east Córdoba province, Argentina, was lost in 20 years to 2007 (Brandolin et al. 2013), with intensification of use driving conversion of pasture to cropland in the Pampas (Piquer-Rodriguez et al. 2018).Habitat shifts due to climate change on the breeding grounds may be affecting the species. How the boreal forest zone will change and then what impacts will manifest for this species remains highly uncertain but is predicted to be negative (Soja et al. 2006, Bouderbala et al. 2023).","The global population is currently estimated at 137,000 mature individuals (Andres et al. 2012). A modelling approach suggested 6.86 million mature individuals in Canada alone (BAM 2020).

The species is not covered by the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM) surveys (Bart and Smith 2012) as it breeds further south, but the observation that these systematic surveys typically increased estimates significantly suggests the population size given by Andres et al.

Greater Yellowlegs is estimated to make up 3.3-7.3% of the shorebird harvest in Barbados, 500–1,600 birds, based on the mean total harvest between 1988 and 2010. It was recorded on 44.4% of market visits in Guyana, but estimates of species harvest are combined with Solitary Sandpiper and Lesser Yellowlegs for a total of 3,907 birds for all three (Andres et al. 2022). A Potential Biological Removal estimate of 10,210 ± 2,234 has been generated for the species (Watts et al. 2015). The PBR estimate for Lesser Yellowlegs was found to be high relative to a Prescribed Take Level framework (Rivera-Milán et al. 2023): if true for this species, the harvest of Greater Yellowlegs might also be considered unsustainable (although the PBR estimate is based on the population estimate which may be a considerable underestimate). Quantification of the harvest throughout the rest of the range is necessary, notably in the rest of the Caribbean and in Brazil (AFSI 2020).

Western Sandpiper is therefore listed as Least Concern.","","Drivers of suspected population declines are not well understood.Habitat loss and degradation are significant threats to C. mauri, particularly through the drainage of wetlands at wintering and stopover sites for urban development, agriculture, and shrimp farming. In the Upper Bay of Panama, urbanisation from Panama City has led to the drainage of the Costa del Este marshes (Frank et al. 2020). Wetland quality has also declined due to the construction of channels and dikes. Additionally, the colonisation by Spartina alterniflora in North American Pacific coast estuaries has the potential to reduce feeding areas by up to 80%, leading to fewer critical foraging and roosting areas (Frank et al. 2020, Stralberg et al. 2004). Environmental contamination, including pollutants from oil spills and agricultural chemicals, poses a threat to C. mauri. Oil spills are a risk along the North American coast, where many stopover and staging sites are near shipping channels and refineries. Agricultural runoff introduces pesticides and other harmful chemicals into their habitats, potentially affecting their health and reproduction (Fernández et al. 2010).Human disturbance from recreational activities (e.g., pedestrians, motorised vehicles, watercraft and pets), coastal development, and shellfish harvesting disrupts the species during migration and wintering periods. Such disturbances lead to energetic costs and habitat displacement, impacting their overall fitness and survival (Fernández et al. 2010). Climate change has by some been identified as a concern (Frank et al. 2020), although available breeding habitat based on predicted distribution under future climate change scenarios is predicted to increase by between 90% (RCP 4.5) and 83% (RCP 8.5) by 2070 (Wauchope et al. 2017).","The species has a large estimated population size (3,500,000 mature individuals; Partners in Flight 2023).",Decreasing,"Western Sandpipers breed in Alaska (USA) from Dillingham to Point Barrow and Camden Bay, including St. Lawrence Island and adjacent Siberia (Russia).

Many migrate inland, across the North American prairies, the Rockies and northern Andes, often staging at high altitude lakes. Adults depart on autumn migration in early July, females slightly preceding males. Juveniles migrate later from the breeding grounds, from late July, in more leisurely fashion, and over a broader front. Northwards migration occurs largely along the same route. It is a vagrant to several European countries, especially Britain and Ireland, and also to Turkey, the Azores, Madeira, Canary and Cape Verde Islands. The species breeds on low mountain tops, river terraces and coastal barren areas and bluffs in high Arctic tundra; dry, high-lying lichen tundra and stony ridges. On migration and in winter the species occurs at inland wetlands to coastal habitats, including grassland, ditches, irrigated or rain-soaked fields, pools in desert, sand dunes; occasionally in upper littoral zone of estuaries, mudflats and beaches; usually on higher parts of the shore or dry fringes of wetland sites, often among vegetation. During the breeding season the diet consists mainly of insects, such as chironomid and cranefly larvae and adults, and beetles; also spiders. On migration, the species feeds on adult and larval beetles, larval Diptera. It is less gregarious than most other calidrines; in winter it can be found in flocks of 20–30 birds; some individuals defend feeding territory. Eggs are laid in June. Monogamous. Nest is relatively exposed; simple, shallow depression in bare ground, or amongst short vegetation, filled with bits of lichens or other vegetation (Van Gils et al. 2015).","The species may be vulnerable to climate change, driving a mismatch between breeding and peak cranefly abundance (Green and Pearce-Higgins 2014). Additionally, like other migratory shorebirds the species is likely affected to an unknown degree by pollution and loss of suitable habitat, both on passage and in non-breeding areas (Hardy et al. 2007).","The species has a large estimated population size, with at least 1,200,000-1,400,000 mature individuals in Arctic Canada alone (Smith et al. in prep., Bart et al. in prep.).The European population (exclusively individuals breeding in Greenland) is estimated at 500-1,000 pairs, which equates to 1,000-2,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).

It also has a large estimated population size (460,000 mature individuals; Partners in Flight 2023), and so does not approach Criteria C or D thresholds. Considering its population trend over three generations (c. 14 years), the data presented in Smith et al. (2023) indicate a slow decline of c. 16% (with a wide confidence interval), although the underlying interannual trend data suggest a fluctuating population. There is some evidence of recent declines from the western USA and Mexico (Migratory Shorebird Project, unpublished data) and from eBird (Fink et al. 2023), but also consistent evidence of a modest overall recent increase in North America from both the Christmas Bird Count (Meehan et al. 2022) and the Breeding Bird Survey (Ziolkowski et al. 2022). The population trend is therefore considered unknown, but there is little evidence the species is declining at a rate that approaches Criterion A thresholds. The species is therefore listed as Least Concern.","During the breeding season, American Avocets inhabit a variety of habitats including salt ponds, potholes, shallow alkaline wetlands, mudflats of inland lakes, impoundments, and evaporation ponds. These wetlands are typically characterised by common cattail (Typha latifolia), bulrushes (Schoenoplectus spp.), or sedges (Carex spp.). However, they spend most of their time in open areas devoid of vegetation, or areas dominated by glasswort (Salicornia spp.), salt grass (Distichlis spp.), and greasewood (Sarcobatus spp.) in upland regions (Ackerman et al. 2020).","Numerous threats have been identified for this species although the current uncertainty over the population trend hampers conclusions over the impact these are having. Threats identified include wetland loss and conversion, driven chiefly by agricultural and urban projects (Ackerman et al. 2020). Although surrogate habitats like salt evaporation ponds and agricultural fields have partially offset these losses, they are not without challenges. For instance, plans to convert former salt ponds in San Francisco Bay back into tidal marsh habitat threaten the species' established breeding population there, as tidal marshes are not preferred foraging or nesting habitats for these birds (Hartman et al. 2021). Furthermore, habitats in the Pacific Flyway crucial for breeding, staging, and wintering, such as those in the San Francisco Bay, are already suffering from pollution from agricultural and industrial degradation of water quality (Ackerman et al. 2014, Harvey et al. 1992) and rising salinity levels (Hannam et al. 2009).Pesticides and other contaminants pose potential threats to R. americana across their habitats. DDT and its metabolites, such as DDE, have accumulated in some avocet populations. Selenium, while essential in low doses, becomes toxic at higher levels, often contaminating wetlands through agricultural practices. Selenium bioaccumulation has led to reproductive failures and developmental abnormalities in avocet embryos and chicks, particularly notable at sites like Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in California. Additionally, methylmercury, which biomagnifies in aquatic food webs, poses a risk, affecting avocet reproduction and development in contaminated areas like San Francisco Bay and Great Salt Lake (Ackerman et al. 2020). Climate change poses a possible threat to wetlands by disrupting their hydrological cycles, which are crucial for their ecological functions. Projections suggest a notable decline in the extent of inundated wetlands throughout the south-central Great Plains by the end of the century, with eastern regions expected to be particularly affected (Londe et al. 2024) . The increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as droughts and intense precipitation, further destabilises wetland ecosystems by altering their hydrological patterns. These changes undermine the critical role of wetlands as crucial stopover sites for migratory wetland birds including as R. americana, potentially limiting their access to essential resources during migration (Londe et al. 2024). ","The global population is estimated to number 460,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2023).",Unknown,"The species inhabit western North America from March to October and migrate to wintering grounds in coastal California, southern Texas, Florida, Louisiana, and south to Guatemala.","",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Development poses a significant threat to C. semipalmatus by encroaching on coastal habitats such as beaches, mudflats, marshes, and wetlands, as well as interior wetlands and lakes. This competition for space intensifies with economic growth, tourism, and urbanisation, leading to habitat destruction, fragmentation, and increased disturbance at essential feeding, roosting, and breeding sites (Senner et al. 2016). Coastal development and water abstraction for agriculture and urban areas further exacerbate habitat loss. While breeding habitat remains relatively stable in the sub-Arctic, coastal areas from South Carolina to Florida have experienced increased development pressures (Rose and Nol 2010). Additionally managed water habitats such as wetlands are diminishing due to climate change impacts and competition for water resources. Trapping of this species for food has been documented in Guyana (Andres et al. 2022) and likely takes placed in other parts of its non-breeding range (see, also, AFSI 2020) but the spatial extent of this threat is poorly documented.The extent to which any of these threats are driving the suspected declines however, is unknown.","Based on PRISM surveys, the population in the Canadian Arctic was estimated to number c.600,000 breeding birds (Bart et al. in prep.).

It arrives on the breeding grounds from mid-May to mid-June where it nests in solitary pairs and forages in small loose groups (Del Hoyo et al. 1996, Billerman et al. 2020, Snow and Perrins 1998).The species breeds on Arctic coasts and in upland areas (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984, Hayman et al. 1986), nesting close to the fringes of snow and ice, on wet moss or barren rocky tundra with patches of lichen and Dryas spp., on rocky islands and islets or on shingle beaches (Del Hoyo et al. 1996, Billerman et al. 2020). It forages on dry tundra or along the moist margins of ponds, at the edges of melting snow-drifts and in areas of thick moss (Hayman et al. 1986). During the winter and on passage the species shows a preference for tidal rocky shores with strong wave action and suitable high-tide roosting areas, often utilising artificial structures such as concrete sea defences and breakwaters (Del Hoyo et al. 1996, Billerman et al. 2020, Hayman et al. 1986). In some northern areas (e.g. Svalbard) the species frequents mudflats, shingle beaches and coastal lagoons before and after breeding but before migrating south (Del Hoyo et al. 1996, Billerman et al. 2020).During the breeding season its diet consists largely of insects (e.g., adult, larval and pupal Diptera, Ichneumon wasps and aphids) and Collembola (springtails), as well as spiders, gastropods, annelid worms and some plant material (e.g. leaves, buds, berries and seeds) (Del Hoyo et al. 1996, Billerman et al. 2020). On the coast the species feeds predominantly upon molluscs (especially gastropods Littorina spp. and mussels Mytilus spp.) as well as insects (e.g. beetles and Diptera), small crustaceans (e.g. amphipods), annelid worms, small fish and algae (Enteromorpha spp.) (Del Hoyo et al. 1996, Billerman et al. 2020, Johnsgard 1981).The nest is a small scrape positioned in the open on tundra moss, in hummocky tundra close to tufts of Dryas spp. or Arctostaphylos spp., or in rocky or pebbly areas between cliffs (Del Hoyo et al. 1996, Billerman et al. 2020, Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984).In the high Arctic, the species typically breeds from sea level up to approximately 300 meters. In the low Arctic and subarctic regions, it primarily breeds inland on uplands, reaching elevations of over 1,000 meters in Sweden and Norway (Cramp and Simmons 1983).","Human activities and habitat degradation in coastal wintering grounds are known threats to the species throughout its North American non-breeding season range. Factors include shoreline development, aquaculture, oil contamination, algae harvesting, and disturbance from boat traffic and other human activities (Burton et al. 1996; Gutowsky et al. 2019). Additionally, the species has been found to have high nest fidelity to specific sites in wintering areas. This makes it more susceptible to large-scale changes in its food base, increased predation pressure and, importantly, habitat loss and disturbance (Mittelhauser et al. 2012). The population in Iceland, residing near human settlements, was found to have elevated levels of harmful contaminants, which poses a localised threat. The species' strong fidelity to nesting sites results in varying levels of contamination among individuals, heightening their exposure to pollutants (Payne and Pierce 2020).Climate change may also be a significant threat to the species. Even under conservative climate change scenarios, the species is predicted to decrease by between 35% and 60% in its non-breeding strongholds in the UK of the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland by 2080 (Rehfisch et al. 2004); the UK wintering population declined by 31% between 1996 and 2021 (Austin et al. 2023). Available breeding habitat based on predicted distribution under future climate change scenarios is predicted to reduce by between 39% (RCP 4.5) and 53% (RCP 8.5) by 2070 (Wauchope et al. 2017).","The species has a relatively large estimated population size of 204,000 to 287,000 individuals (Wetlands International 2023), with the number of mature individuals calculated as two-thirds of this range.

Consequently, the species' trend is currently best described as unknown. In the absence of evidence that it is declining at a rate approaching Criterion A thresholds, the species continues to warrant listing as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is a full migrant that travels via marine routes and has been observed migrating 80-160 km offshore. Adult females depart from the breeding grounds in early-June, followed by the adult males and juveniles in late-July and August, most arriving in the non-breeding quarters by the end of November. The species departs Chilean and South African seas in March, and West African and south-west African seas in April, migrating along the Arctic coasts and reoccupying breeding grounds from late-May to early-June. It may also rest 2-3 weeks at the edge of sea ice in the High Arctic, waiting for the land to thaw before nesting (Snow and Perrins 1998). Once in the breeding grounds, the species breeds between June and July (from mid-June to mid-July in Iceland, and from early-June to early-July in Russia). The species is gregarious at all times of the year (Snow and Perrins 1998), and will even breed in loose groups where the habitat is favourable. Habitat Breeding This species breeds close to the coast on marshy tundra with small pools, on boggy meadows with moss and grass, in marshy river valleys, or on islets in fjords. Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season this species is pelagic and frequents upwelling zones in the tropics and subtropics where plankton occurs in high concentrations (e.g. over 50,000 organisms/litre). Diet Breeding During the breeding season the diet of this species consists chiefly of invertebrates, such as adult and larval insects (e.g. beetles, caddisflies, dipteran flies, bugs), molluscs, crustaceans, annelid worms, spiders, mites, jellyfish (Johnsgard 1981) and occasionally plant material (seeds) when animal matter is scarce. Non-breeding During this season the species feeds at sea on plankton, including amphipods less than 2 mm long, Hydrozoa and small fish from the water surface or just below. Breeding site The nest is a shallow cup or scrape on the ground in short vegetation (e.g. sedges or grasses) and is usually close to or surrounded by water (Johnsgard 1981, Snow and Perrins 1998).","Climate change poses a potential future risk to the species. By 2100, it is projected that suitable breeding habitat in the north-east Atlantic will decline by 93%, leaving only 6% remaining suitable and 1% potentially becoming more suitable (Häkkinen et al. 2023). The species inhabits high-latitude wet tundra areas, which are anticipated to diminish over the next century, a trend that is already underway. Given their tendency to aggregate in large groups within relatively confined areas, the species is exposed to mass mortality events triggered by extreme weather events. Even localised impacts of climate change could have profound effects on population dynamics. While demonstrated to be better able to adjust nest initiation time to earlier snowmelt than other shorebird species studied in a limited area in Alaska (Saalfield and Lanctot 2017), this still remains a significant threat, causing the species to be assessed as moderately vulnerable in Alaska (Liebezeit et al. 2012). The species relies on predator alarm warning from breeding Arctic Terns Sterna paradisaea, and localised populations have decreased rapidly from some breeding colonies in Greenland in the absence of Arctic Terns (Jørgensen et al. 2007). Further to this, it is believed that this association may be due to Red Phalaropes being vulnerable to Arctic Fox Vulpes lagopus predation (Egevang et al. 2009).The species is also particularly vulnerable to plastics as surface feeders who diet typically consists of zooplankton found offshore in upwelling areas, and of adult and larval insects on their breeding ground (Teboul et al. 2021). Consequently, they may mistake floating plastic pieces for prey, and this can lead to mortality events (Drever et al. 2018). Concerningly, P. fulicarius have also been found to have often stopped within the North Pacific Current, which is at the northern boundary of the plastic-laden ‘Great Pacific Garbage Patch’ (Lebreton et al. 2018) which could lead to high mortality rates due to the extreme volume of plastic in this region. Other threats include disturbance from forestry activities, ship traffic, bycatch, wind farms, and high volume tourism (Häkkinen et al. 2023).Overall, however, it is currently wholly unknown whether these threats are driving population declines.","It has a very large estimated population size, with almost 7,000,000 mature individuals in Arctic Canada alone (Smith et al. in prep.), and a broadly estimated Russian population of c.10,000-1 million breeding pairs (Brazil 2009), but probably towards the higher end of this. The European population is estimated at 570-1,700 males, which equates to 1,100-3,400 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015). The population in Alaska likely numbers more than 1,000,000 mature individuals based on the area of suitable habitat, densities reported, and the numbers in Arctic Canada.

Considering its population trend over three generations (c. 11 years), the data presented in Smith et al. (2023) indicate a slow decline of c. 4%, albeit with interannual fluctuations. This is broadly consistent with the c. 11% decline recorded by the Breeding Bird Survey (Ziolkowski et al. 2022), as part of a long-term decline. Conversely, data from the Christmas Bird Count (Meehan et al. 2022) indicate a stable non-breeding population in the southern USA (following a slow long-term increase there, possibly due to short-stopping under climate change), while eBird (Fink et al. 2023) suggests a c. 6% increase on the breeding grounds. The overall population trend is therefore considered stable, and certainly is not declining rapidly. It therefore does not approach Criterion A thresholds, and the species continues to warrant listing as Least Concern.","This species nests in diverse habitats, including shorelines, sagebrush, grasslands, and forests, at altitudes from sea level to 4,700 metres. It often breeds in arid regions but only near water. Females typically defend territories that encompass a shoreline (stream or lake) for foraging, drinking, bathing, and displaying; semi open areas for nesting; and dense vegetation patches for brood cover (Reed et al. 2020).","Like many shorebirds, A. macularius is likely threatened by climate change due to shifts in temperature, altered precipitation patterns, and the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events. Indirect effects, such as changes in land use, prey availability, phenological mismatches, and increased susceptibility to disease and parasitism, also may pose risks (Sutherland et al. 2012). However, Galbraith et al.

Although it has a relatively small estimated population size (18,000 mature individuals; Partners in Flight 2023), this does not approach Criteria C or D thresholds. Regarding its population trend over three generations (c. 17 years), data from the Christmas Bird Count (Meehan et al. 2022) indicate a decline of c. 45%, but as only a very small proportion of the species' wintering range is covered by the CBC, this is not considered representative (B. Andres in litt. to Partners in Flight 2020). Similarly, while the Breeding Bird Survey (Ziolkowski et al. 2022) suggests that the population remained broadly stable overall, only some parts of the species' range are well covered by the BBS (A. Shaw in litt. to Partners in Flight 2023). Consequently, the species' trend is currently best described as unknown (Partners in Flight 2023). In the absence of convincing evidence that it is declining at a rate approaching Criterion A thresholds, the species continues to warrant listing as Least Concern.","The species breeds in diverse habitats often associated with dwarf shrub upland and montane tundra, shaped by Pleistocene glacial events. Typical breeding landscapes include rocky, gravelly alluvium, morainal deposits, kettle lakes, tarns, scree slopes, and braided creeks and rivers. These areas are usually, but not always, bordered by riparian vegetation. In specific regions like the Kilbuck Mountains and Prince William Sound, it is found in narrow, steep-sided valleys, alpine lake shorelines, and gravel areas above the tide line. The species also nests in placer mining areas with old tailing piles. Nests are found on patchily vegetated dwarf shrub tundra near watercourses and kettle lakes, sometimes several hundred meters from fluviatile waters (Gill et al. 2020).Non-breeding and overwintering habitat: in North America, the species primarily inhabits rocky intertidal zones, including high-energy shorelines, reefs, and sea stacks, as well as human-made structures like jetties and piers. Occasionally, it is found on freshwater impoundments near the coast and estuarine substrates. Outside North America, the species uses a wider range of habitats, including coral reefs, basalt platforms, river mouths, lagoon margins, and both natural and artificial coastal impoundments. It can also occur inland along streams, wetlands, and meadows. The species has been recorded in dense vegetation like mangrove forests, flooded coconut plantations, grassy areas, airport margins, and various human-modified areas, including golf courses and building structures (Gill et al. 2020).","Because the species is associated with fluviatile waters, placer mining in its breeding range might pose some risk to breeding populations, though the effects are not well understood (Alaska Shorebird Group 2019). Additionally, the species' reliance on hard substrate littoral habitats throughout the year makes it vulnerable to coastal oil spills. As it is estimated that around 90% of the population breeds in Alaska, any threats in this region could disproportionately affect the overall population (Alaska Shorebird Group 2019). Whilst exposure to oil is not necessarily fatal, repeated exposure can have sublethal effects that can ultimately lead to population-level impacts through diminished health and reproductive fitness (Henkel et al. 2012) Like many shorebirds, the species is also likely threatened by sea-level rise due to climate change as this can cause habitat degradation and shifts, increased variability in climate and phenological mismatches. Additionally, as sea levels rise, species composition and total productivity in littoral-zone invertebrate communities crucial for its survival will likely be affected (Rehfisch and Crick 2003). Although their breeding habitat is likely safeguarded from development due to its location, non-breeding habitats further down the coast are likely affected by habitat loss resulting from agricultural intensification, industrial development, resource harvesting, and other activities that can impact shorebird habitats (Fernández and Lank 2008). However, the extent to which these factors affect this species remains unknown.","The species has a relatively small estimated population size at 18,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2023).",Unknown,"The species occurs in Alaska (breeding), and along the Pacific coastline, as well as Guam, Minor Outlying Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands, USA, also breeding in the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and North West British Columbia, Canada, and from North East Koryak Highlands, Russia.

It also has a large estimated population size (250,000 mature individuals; Partners in Flight 2023), and so does not approach Criteria C or D thresholds. Considering its population trend over three generations (c. 18 years), the data presented in Smith et al. (2023) indicate a slow decline of c. 10%, albeit with large confidence intervals. This is broadly consistent with evidence of similar rates of decline from the Breeding Bird Survey (c. 7%; Ziolkowski et al. 2022), eBird (c. 6%; Fink et al. 2023) and Partners in Flight (2023; c. 15%). In recent years, a steeper decline has been recorded on the Pacific coast by the Migratory Shorebird Project (unpublished data), although this covers a relatively small proportion of the population. Conversely, data from the Christmas Bird Count (Meehan et al. 2022) indicate a stable population. Although the population is declining, it does not currently appear to be declining at a rate approaching Criterion A thresholds. Hence, the species continues to warrant listing as Least Concern.","","The two subspecies are threatened to varying degrees by hunting. While Western Willets (Tringa semipalmata inornate) are generally protected from hunting threats by the passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 1918, Eastern Willets (T. s. semipalmata) face ongoing hunting pressures on their non-breeding grounds in Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil and the Caribbean (Watts and Turrin 2016, Atlantic Flyway Shorebird Initiative Harvest Working Group 2020, AFSI 2020, Andres et al. 2022). Suriname, in particular, has the highest harvest of migratory shorebirds in the Western Hemisphere (Atlantic Flyway Shorebird Initiative Harvest Working Group 2020). The extent of hunting pressure across different non-breeding locations remains poorly understood, but research by Watts et al. (2015) indicates that both subspecies, especially T. s. semipalmata, have low sustainable harvest rates compared to other shorebirds, making them particularly vulnerable to hunting. T. s. semipalmata breeding on the Atlantic Coast face greater risks during migration compared to Gulf Coast breeders, as they cross the Caribbean and winter in northern South America, where they encounter high harvest levels (Watts and Turrin 2016). Habitat development, notably in the San Francisco Bay area, poses another significant threat to the species (Warnock et al. 2021). Throughout their non-breeding range, the species is confronted with the loss of tidal mudflats and mangroves, critical habitats that have dwindled in extent in a few key countries in recent years (Thomas et al. 2017, Murray et al. 2019). In Mexico, economic development threatens important shorebird sites through agriculture, commercial fishing, shrimp aquaculture, tourism, and hunting. Interior-staging Willets, which depend on shallow-water habitats, are also affected as many of these habitats are converted to agriculture or managed at high water levels for irrigation and tourism. Grasslands, which are critical habitats for the species, are the most threatened ecosystem worldwide, with less than 1% remaining intact in some parts of North America. While grazing can help maintain low vegetation, overgrazing is a significant issue. The conversion of native grasslands to agriculture creates 'sink' habitats where nesting attempts often fail, and Willets tend to avoid the tall, dense covers planted for waterfowl (Lowther et al. 2020). The draining and ploughing of wetlands for crops, along with maintaining high water levels for tourism and irrigation, further degrade these habitats.","It has a large estimated population size of 250,000 mature individuals (Partners in Flight 2023).",Decreasing,"The species comprises two distinct subspecies, differentiated by their breeding habitats in North America. Eastern Willets (T. s. semipalmata) breed in estuarine marshes along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, while Western Willets (T. s. inornate) breed in wet grasslands and prairies in the interior west of North America (Heath et al. 2021). T. s. inornate primarily use non-breeding habitats along the Pacific Coast of the United States, though their non-breeding range also extends to the US Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and the Pacific Coast of Central and South America. In contrast, T. s. semipalmata winter in Central and South America, encompassing much of their known non-breeding range (Huysman et al. 2020).","Evidence of relatively high levels of hunting from the Caribbean and northern South America (e.g. AFSI 2020, Andres et al. 2012).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The species occupies mosaics of different habitats requiring open, sparsely vegetated land for display, good shelter for roosting and sometimes shrubs or trees for feeding above the snow in winter (Tucker and Heath 1994). In northern Europe it prefers deciduous or mixed forests to coniferous forest and spare, young stands to older denser ones. In southern European mountains such as the Alps it mainly uses moderately dense forest of spruce and fir, or larch (de Juana and Boesman 2013). It uses logged clearings in boreal forest, but such successional stages are ephemeral, necessitating local shifts in distribution. In western and central Europe the species uses heathland and meadows and in the central European mountains it uses areas around the treeline (Tucker and Heath 1994). It is also known to use bogs and areas of marginal cultivation. It lays between May and June. Laying an average of eight eggs (de Juana and Boesman 2013). Males form leks at traditional sites (Tucker and Heath 1994). The nest is a shallow scrape usually lined with some plant material and feathers. In many places it feeds on birch catkins and buds, shoots, needles, cones and male flowers of conifers in winter. In areas with less snow cover it uses more shrubs and grasses. In spring it switches to berries, stems and shoots of shrubs. It is largely sedentary although eruptive in some northern areas, with flocks moving hundreds of kilometres (de Juana and Boesman 2013).","In western and central Europe, habitat fragmentation and destruction are serious threats (Tucker and Heath 1994), which occur mostly through increased cultivation, afforestation of heathlands, removal of birch stands and the planting of coniferous monocultures (de Juana and Boesman 2013). Intensive grazing of sheep is replacing traditional grazing that normally helped maintain suitable habitat, leading to the destruction of birch (Betula) scrub and heather moorland. In central Europe, heathland is being transformed into grassland by eutrophication through airborne nitrogen deposition (Tucker and Heath 1994). Related to these large-scale land use changes, predation by mammalian and avian predators appears to have increased. (Storch 2007). On a local scale, other threats include hunting and disturbance at leks. In the Italian Alps, stress hormone levels have been shown to be increased by disturbance from snow sport, which may reduce resistance to disease (de Juana and Boesman 2013). Collisions with high-tension powerlines may kill many birds in Scandinavia and in Scotland, collisions with deer fences may be a problem. It is also thought long-term climate trends may partly explain recent declines (Storch 2007).","In Europe, the total population size is estimated at 2,430,000-3,750,000 mature individuals, with 1,210,000-1,880,000 breeding calling males (BirdLife International 2021), and comprises approximately 35% of the species' global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is between 6,940,000-10,700,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is desirable. The European trend for this species is not known (BirdLife International 2021), although its population in Fennoscandia has fluctuated (PECBMS 2023). The population has suffered major declines and range contractions over much of its range owing to afforestation of heathland, increased cultivation and planting of coniferous monocultures, and also suffers locally from over-hunting (del Hoyo et al. 1994). This species is considered to have a medium dependency on forest habitat, which is estimated to be declining at a rate of 7.1% over the past three generations within its mapped range (Global Forest Watch 2024).

In general the species is fully and effectively protected in western and central Europe. In other European countries (e.g., Austria, Italy and France) hunting is strictly regulated.

In areas where it is hunted, regular monitoring occurs to plan harvests and in areas with small remnant populations. In some countries, such as Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium, campaigns to limit disturbance have been initiated. These generally use public awareness campaigns, re-routing of hiking and skiing trails and the closure of core areas to the public. The release of captive bred birds to supplement wild populations has been attempted several times with little success (Storch 2007).Conservation Actions ProposedThe following proposed conservation actions refer to the species's European range only. The preservation and restoration of suitable habitat through habitat management is needed. The integration of land-use practices and conservation measures is essential. In addition maintaining and restoring spatial connectivity between populations is required. In areas where illegal hunting occurs, better law enforcement is needed. Monitoring should be continued and undertaken in areas where the species is endangered in order to establish population trends and effectiveness of management plans (Storch 2007). Further research is required (Tucker and Heath 1994, Storch 2007) and should investigate the impacts of hunting, habitat fragmentation and patch isolation, dispersal rates and distances, large-scale habitat relationships and population dynamics. Management experimentation is needed (Storch 2007).",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

The chicks are reared by both parents and leave the nest after 11–13 days and become independent after about 30 days (Hagemeijer and Blair 1997, Tomiałojć 2012, Clement and Christie 2016).  The diet of the species consists predominantly of seeds, buds and shoots of trees and shrubs.  In particular the nestlings are fed by small invertebrates.  Food is collected at all levels in trees and also on the ground (Clement and Christie 2016).  The species is resident and migratory.  Asian populations are largely migratory whereas in northern and central Europe the species is sedentary, locally dispersive or partially migratory (Clement and Christie 2016).","Generally there is no evidence for substantial threats at least within its European range. Since the 1990s the species has expanded its European range.  Declines in some countries are possibly related to destruction of deciduous forest, removal of old orchards and increased predation (BirdLife International 2015, Clement and Christie 2016).","In Europe, the total population size is estimated at 7,280,000-12,100,000 mature individuals, with 3,640,000-6,020,000 breeding pairs (BirdLife International 2021), and comprises approximately 50% of the species' global range, so a very preliminary estimate of the global population size is between 14,600,000-24,200,000 mature individuals, although further validation of this estimate is desirable.

On its wintering grounds in Australia the species also makes erratic movements in relation to ranifall (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It breeds from late-May to early-August in loose colonies (del Hoyo et al. 1996) of 3-30 pairs (Labutin et al. 1982) and migrates in flocks of up to 1,000 individuals (del Hoyo et al. 1996). During the non-breeding season it occurs in dense flocks of several hundreds or thousands of individuals and gathers in large flocks to roost during the warmest part of the day and at night (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Habitat Breeding The species breeds in secondary vegetation growth in open burnt areas or in grassy clearings in northern montane larch Larix spp. or dwarf birch woodland, chiefly along river valleys (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996) or on well-drained (Labutin et al. 1982) southward-facing mountain slopes (Flint et al. 1984). Non-breeding On passage the species shows a preference for foraging and resting in swampy meadows near lakes and along river valleys (Flint et al. 1984). It overwinters on dry inland grassland, bare cultivation (del Hoyo et al. 1996), dry mudflats and coastal plains of black soil (Johnsgard 1981) with scattered shallow pools of freshwater (Higgins and Davies 1996), swamps, lakes or flooded ground (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It shows a preference for short grass swards of less than 20 cm tall, and occasionally occurs in dry saltmarshes, coastal swamps, mudflats or sandflats in estuaries, or on the beaches of sheltered coasts (Higgins and Davies 1996). Diet Its diet consists predominantly of adult and larval insects (del Hoyo et al. 1996) (e.g. grasshoppers, crickets, weevils, beetles, caterpillars, ants (del Hoyo et al. 1996) and termites (Bellio et al. 2006)) and spiders as well as vegetable matter including seeds, rice husks and berries (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression located on open ground (del Hoyo et al. 1996) in open burnt areas or grassy clearings in larch Larix spp. or dwarf birch woodland, chiefly along river valleys (Hayman et al. 1986, del Hoyo et al. 1996).

For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","Behaviour This species is strongly migratory and travels largely overland on a broad front between its breeding and wintering grounds (del Hoyo et al. 1996). It breeds from early-June to July in solitary pairs, usually well-dispersed but sometimes very close together within wetlands (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The departure from the breeding grounds starts in July and peaks between August and September, with the return northward migration peaking between April and May (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species is only mildly gregarious outside of the breeding season and usually forages singly or in small groups (del Hoyo et al. 1996) of 3-7 individuals although it rarely also occurs in flocks of between 15 and 50 individuals (Johnsgard 1981). Habitat Breeding The species breeds near pools (Johnsgard 1981) on open, grassy bogs or swamps (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996) or on mountain tundra (Flint et al. 1984) in boreal forest (taiga) (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996), showing a preference for areas with mosses, sedges and dwarf willows Salix spp. for nesting (Johnsgard 1981). Non-breeding Outside of the breeding season the species occupies shallow inland wetlands (Johnsgard 1981, Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo et al. 1996) and although it shows no preference over fresh, brackish or saline waters it does require habitats with soft, muddy shorelines and short grass (Johnsgard 1981, Higgins and Davies 1996), sedges, floating aquatic vegetation, reeds and rushes (Higgins and Davies 1996). Suitable habitats include the edges of permanent and temporary lakes (Johnsgard 1981, Higgins and Davies 1996), ponds, reservoirs (Higgins and Davies 1996), lagoons, swamps (Johnsgard 1981, Higgins and Davies 1996) and streams, river flood-plains (Higgins and Davies 1996), marshes (Johnsgard 1981), rice-fields (del Hoyo et al. 1996), sewage ponds, saltpans (Higgins and Davies 1996, del Hoyo et al. 1996) and saltmarshes (del Hoyo et al. 1996). The species also less frequently occurs around tidal estuaries (Higgins and Davies 1996) on intertidal mudflats (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996). Diet Its diet includes insects (e.g. carabid beetles), small gastropod molluscs, crustaceans (del Hoyo et al. 1996) amphibians (Johnsgard 1981) and seeds (del Hoyo et al. 1996). Breeding site The nest is a shallow depression (del Hoyo et al. 1996) on a hummock of sedge (Flint et al. 1984) well-hidden (del Hoyo et al. 1996) in areas with mosses, sedges and dwarf willows Salix spp. near pools (Johnsgard 1981) on open, grassy bogs or swamps (Johnsgard 1981, Flint et al. 1984, del Hoyo et al. 1996) or on mountain tundra (Flint et al. 1984) in boreal forest (taiga) (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo et al. 1996).
